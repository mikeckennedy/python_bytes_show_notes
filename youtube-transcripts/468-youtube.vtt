00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Hey, Brian. Hey, YouTube. How's it going?

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Good.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Good, good. Good to be here with everyone. You ready to kick us off?

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:25.720
<v Michael Kennedy>your earbuds. This is episode 468, recorded February 2nd, 2026. I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Brian Okken>And I'm Brian Akin.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Michael Kennedy>This episode is brought to you by us.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Brian's books, his new Lean TDD book,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.800
<v Michael Kennedy>which you can get right now and is in development,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Michael Kennedy>but almost done.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Michael Kennedy>He's going to be done this week, folks.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Don't worry about it.

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Michael Kennedy>So my Python and production book has been going strong as well.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Michael Kennedy>That's a really fun one.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Michael Kennedy>And, of course, our courses.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Michael Kennedy>All the links for those things are in the show notes.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Follow us on the socials.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Sign up for the newsletter.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.580
<v Michael Kennedy>We don't spam you.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Michael Kennedy>We just send you updates about the episodes, extra information, more links, that kind of thing,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.580
<v Michael Kennedy>as well as a periodic announcement of like, hey, we've got a new course or a new book or whatever it is we're up to.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Things like that.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Michael Kennedy>But we don't give it away.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Michael Kennedy>We don't sell it.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Things like that.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.660
<v Michael Kennedy>And with that, like a bolt of lightning striking out of the blue, what do we got?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.860
<v Brian Okken>Well, we've got Django Bolt.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:40.720
<v Brian Okken>So Django Bolt is actually, I learned about Django Bolt because I was looking at the Django Chat website,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Brian Okken>or the django chat and they had a um they had an episode building a django api framework faster

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Brian Okken>than fast api which of course i was interested in and so this is this episode actually discusses um

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Brian Okken>django bolt and um uh django bolt uh is a is a rust powered behind the scenes but it's inspired it's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.759
<v Brian Okken>a so it's like fast um like we already have django rest framework and there's django ninja

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Brian Okken>but this is along those lines of trying to get an API framework for Django.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.320
<v Brian Okken>The inspiration is kind of interesting.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Brian Okken>I think down near the bottom, there's inspired by Django REST framework,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.860
<v Brian Okken>FastAPI, Lightstar, and Robin.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Brian Okken>Apparently, some of the Rust Python,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.320
<v Brian Okken>the integrating rest and python it was inspired by some of the robin project i don't know anything

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:52.340
<v Brian Okken>about robin actually so um but uh so interesting different take on apis for um uh for django i was

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Brian Okken>in one of the things that was really interesting especially in the discussion on the podcast

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.499
<v Brian Okken>was um the the uh the timing of it trying to figure out um how fast things are and there's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.400
<v Brian Okken>You know, there's issues with that,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.600
<v Brian Okken>but apparently he used like a ton of graphs,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.980
<v Brian Okken>a ton of charts, so you can look at what's going on.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.600
<v Brian Okken>Also, in the act of doing that,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Brian Okken>realize that the Django, you know,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.200
<v Brian Okken>even Django REST framework,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Brian Okken>if you configure things in a certain way,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.940
<v Brian Okken>you can do off-the-shelf things and get it pretty fast anyway.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.520
<v Brian Okken>But so this is an interesting take.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.800
<v Brian Okken>So there's a bunch of links we're going to link to.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.280
<v Brian Okken>There's the Jenga Bolt repository.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.700
<v Brian Okken>The documentation is set up and it's pretty good.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.860
<v Brian Okken>Oh, I should back up.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.500
<v Brian Okken>There's a little warning in it that it's still in progress.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.960
<v Brian Okken>It's under active development.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Brian Okken>So be aware of that.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Brian Okken>Then there's the podcast episode.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:05.660
<v Brian Okken>And then just recently somebody came out with a video walking through using Django Bolt, which is an interesting discussion.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Brian Okken>And I actually just watched the first part of it.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Brian Okken>The first part of it actually talks about some of the ecosystem around APIs in Django and then walking through a little bit of it.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.799
<v Brian Okken>So pretty interesting take on APIs.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.200
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah that is super interesting

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I've been looking at Django Bolt as well

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.700
<v Michael Kennedy>not because I plan to use it

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.380
<v Michael Kennedy>because my websites are not in Django

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Michael Kennedy>but it's got some really interesting

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Michael Kennedy>ideas out there

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Michael Kennedy>also note on the performance thing

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Michael Kennedy>do your own performance testing

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it's more importantly

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Michael Kennedy>people should think about this

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.340
<v Michael Kennedy>side by side

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.279
<v Michael Kennedy>like 3 or 4 weeks ago

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Michael Kennedy>when I did my Python numbers, everyone should know.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Every Python developer should know.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Michael Kennedy>People said, well, you did this on an M4 Pro CPU,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.220
<v Michael Kennedy>and it's not gonna be the same

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.000
<v Michael Kennedy>when you run it on a $5 crappy server in the cloud.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, true.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Michael Kennedy>But if I run it on a $5 server,

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.060
<v Michael Kennedy>the people go, well, it doesn't run,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.700
<v Michael Kennedy>that's not comparable to my high-end server or whatever, right?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, it's more like, okay, this one is relative to that.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.820
<v Michael Kennedy>This is like 2x of that other one or something, right?

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.540
<v Michael Kennedy>So just keep that in mind, right?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I mean...

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know what these numbers are tested on.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.320
<v Brian Okken>Right, but also, I mean, as long as the numbers are relatively tested,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.260
<v Brian Okken>you're doing A and B on the same hardware.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Brian Okken>Now, there might be differences in the behind the CPython implementation

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.419
<v Brian Okken>based on different hardware

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.580
<v Brian Okken>and to the point where one technique will work better on some platform than another but i don't

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.840
<v Brian Okken>think a lot of people are thinking in the dirt that much but yeah anyway yeah yeah uh one quick

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Michael Kennedy>bit of real time follow-up from simposts in the audience my first job was in django i always loved

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.260
<v Michael Kennedy>django rm plus migrations framework and jango bolt connects orm with fast async stuff which is really

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.859
<v Michael Kennedy>cool indeed yeah it did seem like a neat a neat project yeah it'll be something to watch indeed

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:24.000
<v Michael Kennedy>but did he mention async? What if you had leaks in your async code? So I want to talk about this

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.960
<v Michael Kennedy>thing called PyLeak. So PyLeak detects leaked async tasks, threads, and event loop blocking.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:42.579
<v Michael Kennedy>So that's not exactly a leak, but it's kind of a leak. So it's non-async code leaking into async

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Michael Kennedy>sections. When I first saw this, I thought it was a memory diagnosing thing. But what it's for is

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.820
<v Michael Kennedy>diagnosing async tasks that if you've ever seen like this, this task was not awaited or something

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:02.560
<v Michael Kennedy>like that. And it's got a really nice programming model. But this is this something that certainly

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Michael Kennedy>can happen I will tell you if you run the ty or the pyrefly typing integration with your editor

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:20.340
<v Michael Kennedy>and maybe pycharm I don't think pycharm does this but those two will put pycharm will detect that

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:28.859
<v Michael Kennedy>the stuff is not being treated right but the others do inline type overlays so you'll have like x equals

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.220
<v Michael Kennedy>some function call and you think x is an integer if it says x and then in little gray like it's not

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.200
<v Michael Kennedy>really in the code but it's putting there colon coroutine of something something int you're like

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:48.540
<v Michael Kennedy>oh i forgot to await that because it's coming back as the unexecuted coroutine not um the number

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:56.739
<v Michael Kennedy>the integer right that it's easy to do if you're writing regular async code but it's really easy

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.700
<v Michael Kennedy>to do if what you're doing is converting a synchronous program to an async program.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Because every call site of every function is synchronous, and then you go make those

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.400
<v Michael Kennedy>functions asynchronous, and then you try to go back and fix them everywhere you called

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:12.600
<v Michael Kennedy>them.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:20.960
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not a syntax or a runtime error, usually, a lot of times, to actually not call that.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.820
<v Michael Kennedy>It'll just run.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.820
<v Michael Kennedy>So for example, you have x, let's say x equals some function call.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Michael Kennedy>It normally gives you back a number.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.780
<v Michael Kennedy>You want to make sure it's not zero.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.219
<v Michael Kennedy>So you'd say if x, if not x or if x, something like that, right?

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, when it's a coroutine, your if x still runs.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.080
<v Michael Kennedy>It's just always true.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.460
<v Michael Kennedy>And things like that, right?

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Because is the coroutine falsy?

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Michael Kennedy>No.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Michael Kennedy>There's only like five or six things in Python that are falsy.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.360
<v Michael Kennedy>And coroutine is not.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.000
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's true.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:49.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Keep going.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.360
<v Michael Kennedy>It's really sketch.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Michael Kennedy>so those are super hard to catch and this is the kind of thing that theoretically will catch it

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Michael Kennedy>so pretty neat anyway uh it doesn't all it depends how you start it i believe right you've got to do

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.920
<v Michael Kennedy>like a create task where the task has to be running if you just create a coroutine and

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Michael Kennedy>don't do anything with it it probably still won't catch it just to be clear anyway so here's how it

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:18.259
<v Michael Kennedy>works you can say create um uh context manager with block in async with block and you say

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.920
<v Michael Kennedy>with no task links, leaks, and you run some code.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And here's a function call to create a task

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Michael Kennedy>that is never awaited.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Michael Kennedy>You wait long enough for that to come into existence

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.140
<v Michael Kennedy>and you're going to get an error, right?

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Or this also works for threads.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Just create a thread and never wait for it to stop.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Michael Kennedy>So the context here is within this block of code,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.840
<v Michael Kennedy>I might be starting threads,

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.920
<v Michael Kennedy>but they should all be done by the time we leave.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.760
<v Michael Kennedy>So this is pretty interesting.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.480
<v Michael Kennedy>And then another one that's common is you can do things

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.780
<v Michael Kennedy>that have async counterparts, but the older way to do them

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.280
<v Michael Kennedy>would block the async I/O thread.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.040
<v Michael Kennedy>And that's really bad because you

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.240
<v Michael Kennedy>want to spend as little time blocking that as possible

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Michael Kennedy>because there's only one thread that does all the async work.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.380
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you're doing fast API or whatever, one thread.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Don't block it, depending on how you set up your server,

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:15.860
<v Michael Kennedy>but generally.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you had old code that said time.sleep,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Michael Kennedy>and then you convert that to async,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.360
<v Michael Kennedy>this should be an await async.io.sleep,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.360
<v Michael Kennedy>so that it just lets the loop go for half a second,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.080
<v Michael Kennedy>rather than block the entire program.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.300
<v Michael Kennedy>So you can say with no event loop blocking.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.420
<v Michael Kennedy>So those are the three types of tests.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Michael Kennedy>So you can do it with context managers, which is pretty cool.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.220
<v Michael Kennedy>You can also do it with decorators, put them on a function,

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.260
<v Michael Kennedy>no thread leaks, no task leaks, and so on.

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:53.060
<v Michael Kennedy>And you get errors like leaked task 2 or whatever.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.820
<v Michael Kennedy>It's pretty descriptive, shows you where it's called and so on.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Another one, though, you'll probably like this, Brian.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Scrolling down a bunch of examples.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Michael Kennedy>But where are you?

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.740
<v Michael Kennedy>They also have a PyTest plugin for it.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Michael Kennedy>So you can come and say, PyTest mark async IO,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.480
<v Michael Kennedy>and then run with no event loop blocking in there,

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.220
<v Michael Kennedy>which is pretty nice.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Michael Kennedy>It's maybe not exactly what I was looking for, is it?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.300
<v Michael Kennedy>There we go.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.160
<v Michael Kennedy>The PyTest plugin.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.400
<v Michael Kennedy>So then you can set it up as a marker with no leaks

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.540
<v Michael Kennedy>and things like that.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:36.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Cool.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:37.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, yeah, if you're doing anything with async programming,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.240
<v Michael Kennedy>it might be worth throwing this on just to see what's going on.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.620
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't think I would leave this on all the time.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.100
<v Michael Kennedy>But having the unit test for it, good.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.060
<v Michael Kennedy>And maybe if you're doing conversions, like I said,

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.900
<v Michael Kennedy>it's especially error-prone to go from converting synchronous code

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:02.060
<v Michael Kennedy>to asynchronous code because it's so easy to overlook converting one bit here or there.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.740
<v Michael Kennedy>So this would ideally catch it.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:05.760
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.960
<v Brian Okken>It'd be one of those things of also timing it.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:16.060
<v Brian Okken>During development, if you had this on to make sure things are cool

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.620
<v Brian Okken>in your synchronous part or async part.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:25.060
<v Brian Okken>And then how much slower is it or how much faster is it if you take that out

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Brian Okken>if there's not much of a difference?

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.200
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, maybe leave it.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, more Django?

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I've actually been thinking about Django a lot lately.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.140
<v Brian Okken>So I've got a few articles.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.520
<v Brian Okken>I just want to kind of run through a few of them that I ran across.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.400
<v Brian Okken>I don't have much to say about either one of them,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.380
<v Brian Okken>so I thought I'd combine them into one topic.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.660
<v Brian Okken>So first off, we have from Paul Taylor,

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.180
<v Brian Okken>migrating from Celery to Django Tasks.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Brian Okken>And I know Django Tasks,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.300
<v Brian Okken>I can't remember if it was just in this recent release.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:00.960
<v Brian Okken>I think so.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Brian Okken>But they're a newish thing.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:10.560
<v Brian Okken>So you might have some code around that you're a project that's using Celery already, and you want to use Django tasks instead.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Brian Okken>So walking through some of the differences and what to watch out for, the different settings.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:27.300
<v Brian Okken>And it made me want to play with it a little bit because apparently Django tasks has, well, if you combine it with cron task,

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.480
<v Brian Okken>you can have tasks run at certain intervals,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.600
<v Brian Okken>which is kind of fun.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.300
<v Brian Okken>That's neat.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Michael Kennedy>You probably can do that with Celery too.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, but how many servers do you want?

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.420
<v Michael Kennedy>This is like if your web app is running,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.300
<v Michael Kennedy>it's happening versus are the servers talking to each other?

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.600
<v Brian Okken>And then next article, this is from Julia Evans,

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.959
<v Brian Okken>and she brought us all those cool zines about programming

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.100
<v Brian Okken>and GitHub and all that stuff.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.700
<v Brian Okken>She wrote some notes on starting to use Django.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.480
<v Brian Okken>And one of the things I just like about this

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.440
<v Brian Okken>is she's an experienced developer.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.900
<v Brian Okken>You probably are already familiar with Julia Evans.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.340
<v Brian Okken>But one of her comments about Django

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.080
<v Brian Okken>is it's less magic than Rails.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.940
<v Brian Okken>And one of the things about that

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.880
<v Brian Okken>isn't just a style thing.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.140
<v Brian Okken>It's when you leave a project

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.800
<v Brian Okken>and come back a few months later,

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.020
<v Brian Okken>Can you pick it up and understand where things are?

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.980
<v Brian Okken>And just her commentary is just Django makes it more obvious.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.060
<v Brian Okken>If you want to look for your views, they're in views.py, things like that.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.920
<v Brian Okken>The built-in admin, of course, is nice.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.340
<v Brian Okken>And the ORM, everybody loves the ORM.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.900
<v Brian Okken>Or if you like the ORM, you love it, probably.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.960
<v Brian Okken>automatic migrations.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Brian Okken>That's a really cool built-in thing of Django.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:58.800
<v Brian Okken>Good docs.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.420
<v Brian Okken>And this is like the third one.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Brian Okken>Oh, built-in email was as neat.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.920
<v Brian Okken>I haven't tried to use email with Django,

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.880
<v Brian Okken>but it's on my to-do list.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.780
<v Brian Okken>Apparently, it's not that difficult.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.440
<v Brian Okken>So that's cool.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.339
<v Brian Okken>One of the things is that she's said

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Brian Okken>that she's been using SQLite for Django in production and followed these instructions.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:28.520
<v Brian Okken>And these instructions is the last article I want to talk about, which is the definitive

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:37.740
<v Brian Okken>guide to using Django with SQLite in production. And I just skimmed this, but it goes through

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:43.080
<v Brian Okken>how to set up databases and cache and all that stuff. I'm going to drop down to the conclusion.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:51.800
<v Brian Okken>there's quite a bit here and but the conclusion says um that is reduced complexity um it still

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:58.380
<v Brian Okken>looks kind of complex to convert to me but um but maybe it's less complex than keeping a sqlite

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:05.340
<v Michael Kennedy>or a postgres database around or something so yeah maybe backup is copy the file that's nice

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:12.059
<v Brian Okken>yeah so um anyway um and i can't remember which article was in there was a discussion around

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Brian Okken>having

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.980
<v Brian Okken>in one of these Django articles about having

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.840
<v Brian Okken>tasks be stored in

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Brian Okken>the database

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.180
<v Brian Okken>itself, which is interesting.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.220
<v Brian Okken>I didn't know you could do that.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.300
<v Michael Kennedy>So yeah,

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Michael Kennedy>fun with Django.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, very cool. I mean, in a sense, we're using

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.160
<v Michael Kennedy>SQLite in production.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Python Bytes has a bunch of

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.720
<v Michael Kennedy>caching through disk cache,

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.580
<v Michael Kennedy>and disk cache is really just a

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.040
<v Michael Kennedy>fancy front end to SQLite.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So if that thing keeps hanging together, I guess it works.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:47.740
<v Michael Kennedy>No, it's good.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.060
<v Michael Kennedy>It's good.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.240
<v Michael Kennedy>So I want to talk about Datastar.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.740
<v Michael Kennedy>So Datastar is a cool framework.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:17:01.020
<v Michael Kennedy>I would, this is not quite the exact right mental model for thinking about it,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.939
<v Michael Kennedy>but it's kind of the spiritual successor to HTMX, I think.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:14.860
<v Michael Kennedy>so the folks behind data star they came from being contributors to the HTM X side

00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:20.060
<v Michael Kennedy>and being big fans of it so for those of you who don't know HTM X super cool

00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:26.459
<v Michael Kennedy>library you it kind of extends the HTML markup to do more things so instead of

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:33.640
<v Michael Kennedy>just saying here's a button you could say here's a button and on click I want you

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.540
<v Michael Kennedy>to call this thing on the server.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.640
<v Michael Kennedy>And when it comes back, I want you

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.820
<v Michael Kennedy>to replace this part of the page with what came back

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.920
<v Michael Kennedy>from the server and so on.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:47.720
<v Michael Kennedy>And HTMX is great, but HTMX only does that sort of local server

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.220
<v Michael Kennedy>communication, right?

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.440
<v Michael Kennedy>So it might update some section.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Michael Kennedy>But what if when that part updates,

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.500
<v Michael Kennedy>another part of the page updates?

00:17:56.419 --> 00:17:58.320
<v Michael Kennedy>And it gets a little bit more complicated.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Michael Kennedy>So what people have done is they paired HTMX with AlpineJS

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:04.980
<v Michael Kennedy>and other things.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.040
<v Michael Kennedy>But AlpineJS has its sort of truth for what the data is.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Michael Kennedy>And then HTMX has the DOM and the server.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.640
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's a little bit your job to juggle the go-between

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.240
<v Michael Kennedy>for these libraries, which is not ideal.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So Datastar takes this idea and says, what

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.000
<v Michael Kennedy>if the server was the source of truth?

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.960
<v Michael Kennedy>What if we could have multiple parts of the page update

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.900
<v Michael Kennedy>In kind of a HTMX way, you say like, if you interact with this,

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.080
<v Michael Kennedy>you know, like click on this element,

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.580
<v Michael Kennedy>I want you to get this stuff from the server.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.780
<v Michael Kennedy>And it sends back the page.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.940
<v Michael Kennedy>And very much like PyView, which we talked about previously,

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.100
<v Michael Kennedy>it will take what comes back from the server,

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.340
<v Michael Kennedy>diff it and figure out, well, this section with this ID

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:50.440
<v Michael Kennedy>is going to be updated over here,

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.460
<v Michael Kennedy>and some other part is going to be updated with this

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.880
<v Michael Kennedy>because that ID part in the thing that came back matches over there.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.680
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's got this really nice way to sort of be a little more holistic,

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Michael Kennedy>but still do HTMX-like attributes with server-sent event things going on.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.500
<v Michael Kennedy>So in a way, it's like PyView.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.280
<v Michael Kennedy>But what's really different about this, two things.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.160
<v Michael Kennedy>First is it's not a web framework.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, PyView is a web framework.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, Django is a web framework.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, Flask is a web framework.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:24.020
<v Michael Kennedy>This is purely a JavaScript library that talks to the server.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.940
<v Michael Kennedy>It basically handles everything on the front end.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.600
<v Michael Kennedy>It's only 11K, too, by the way, so it's incredibly small.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And it does what AlpineJS does.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.140
<v Michael Kennedy>It has sort of a data binding thing.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Michael Kennedy>And the server can say, I know you have a variable called username.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Michael Kennedy>And if I update username on the server,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.000
<v Michael Kennedy>it will automatically change the page everywhere username is used.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.880
<v Michael Kennedy>So it has these things called signals as well.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Pretty neat library, like this star field here.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Michael Kennedy>see how if if you go to the website it's following my mouse around you can make it go faster or

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:05.000
<v Michael Kennedy>slower it feels like you're in Star Wars which is pretty cool but all of that is being driven by

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.040
<v Michael Kennedy>server set events off of the server which is pretty neat there's a bunch of cool examples so you go

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:18.760
<v Michael Kennedy>to the examples page of it as zoom back a bit they also have this really fun video so you should

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Michael Kennedy>definitely watch the video but let me show you an example so there's a bunch of these examples and

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:31.840
<v Michael Kennedy>if i open up two of these and put them side by side i can use the new vivaldi thing or i can

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:40.260
<v Michael Kennedy>tile them together and if i get them to zoom the same size so if you come over here you can just

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:47.798
<v Michael Kennedy>type and put if you put these two side by side you can say record podcast and boom they're both going

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.460
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know this one is, I'm going to finish that one.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.440
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm going to finish that.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's show only the completed ones.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:53.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, wow.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.600
<v Michael Kennedy>And that happens to be on my same machine,

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.540
<v Michael Kennedy>but really they could be anywhere.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.800
<v Michael Kennedy>There's a really bunch of interesting performance things

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.000
<v Michael Kennedy>around with Datastar.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.140
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you kind of like HTMX, but you're like,

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:09.280
<v Michael Kennedy>ah, but it's a little bit not quite enough

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Michael Kennedy>for what I need to do, check this out.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Michael Kennedy>It's a really cool thing.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.358
<v Michael Kennedy>And this episode with the Datastar team

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.240
<v Michael Kennedy>is coming out on Talk Python this week.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Michael Kennedy>I wanted to feature Datastar on the show sooner,

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.880
<v Michael Kennedy>but then when I knew I was going to have them on Talk Python,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.540
<v Michael Kennedy>I was like, well, let me just wait until I get that episode recorded.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.160
<v Michael Kennedy>People who are more interested can listen to that as well.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.060
<v Michael Kennedy>So that's coming out.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.080
<v Brian Okken>Plus a couple bonuses on this.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.480
<v Brian Okken>One, the website, just the retro look of it looks awesome.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.580
<v Michael Kennedy>It's great, isn't it?

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:52.160
<v Brian Okken>everything and that they use the um the term hypermedia kind of love that back yeah i do to

00:21:52.460 --> 00:22:01.040
<v Michael Kennedy>the origins so yeah yeah for sure and there's also this really nice article by um chris may

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:08.660
<v Michael Kennedy>who is a very big fan of htmax gave some a django you know flask on talk on it um

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:14.760
<v Michael Kennedy>and basically went through and said why why do i think i'm using datastar these days so

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.700
<v Michael Kennedy>So really nice example, but got some Python examples.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.380
<v Michael Kennedy>There's a Python SDK that you can bring in.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.540
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you are using Flask, use the SDK.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.940
<v Michael Kennedy>If you're using FastAPI, use the SDK or whatever.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.780
<v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, super neat.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:31.960
<v Brian Okken>OK, cool.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:33.760
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.520
<v Michael Kennedy>That's it for all of our topics, isn't it?

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:36.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Michael Kennedy>What?

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Got anything out there you want to cover?

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Any extras?

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.300
<v Brian Okken>Okay, so yeah, a couple of extras.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.180
<v Brian Okken>Let's see, I'm all zoomed out.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.020
<v Brian Okken>So I did bring up Django chat before.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.260
<v Brian Okken>I was lucky enough to be asked to be on the show as well.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.400
<v Brian Okken>So I was talking about Lean TDD

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.020
<v Brian Okken>and a lot of other stuff on the Django chat podcast.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.460
<v Brian Okken>One of the things they asked me is about the trends

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Brian Okken>in web frameworks for Python.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.820
<v Brian Okken>And I'm like, man, I'm the wrong guy to ask about that.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Brian Okken>But yeah, sure.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.000
<v Brian Okken>OK.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.840
<v Michael Kennedy>You mean the ones that run on the hardware that control the Wi-Fi signals?

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:22.720
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.480
<v Brian Okken>So anyway, so I am working a little bit at Django lately.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.520
<v Brian Okken>But I'm by no means a Django expert.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:37.960
<v Brian Okken>But we did get into the Lean TDD and inverting the testing pyramid a little bit.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:42.720
<v Brian Okken>One of the things I love about this, and it was really fun, because Carlton, when I brought up the fact,

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:48.780
<v Brian Okken>brought up some reasons to shy away from unit tests as much.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.620
<v Brian Okken>Carlton kind of got his feathers ruffled,

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Brian Okken>and we walked through some of the good aspects of unit tests

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.440
<v Brian Okken>and where you might want to keep them, where you might want to ditch them.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.160
<v Brian Okken>So that was fun.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:11.100
<v Brian Okken>The next extra is that I did notice that the PEP 686,

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:16.340
<v Brian Okken>making UTF-8 mode the default is now, or maybe it was.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.320
<v Brian Okken>Maybe it was a while ago.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.760
<v Brian Okken>But anyway, I just noticed that it was finals.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.200
<v Brian Okken>If we haven't covered it already, it's finalized.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.140
<v Brian Okken>And in 3.15, it'll be there.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.020
<v Brian Okken>So that's good.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I think that's all my interest.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.860
<v Michael Kennedy>This is a really old request, but it didn't get until next year, right?

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:33.760
<v Michael Kennedy>3.15.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.420
<v Michael Kennedy>So this was originally started in 2022.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.800
<v Michael Kennedy>But it's not yet in Python, right?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.840
<v Michael Kennedy>It's 3.15, as you point out.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I'm looking forward to having the default be just UTF-8.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I mean, if you're going to have a default,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.720
<v Michael Kennedy>let's pick the one that is mostly used

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.060
<v Michael Kennedy>and supports all the different languages and emojis

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.720
<v Michael Kennedy>because it's important to have emojis.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:02.660
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.520
<v Brian Okken>Before we move on, I do have, I guess, a way side tangent topic.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Brian Okken>Kind of the sci-fi-ness of Datastar reminded me that recently I remembered the cheesy 80s movie

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:22.200
<v Brian Okken>that reminded me of Tesla's Cybertrucks.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.000
<v Brian Okken>And the cheesy movie was called Megaforce, and it's from 81.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.540
<v Brian Okken>Did you ever see Megaforce?

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Michael Kennedy>I have somehow missed this cultural phenomenon.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:36.520
<v Brian Okken>Well, you're probably well off because Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 6%.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:43.020
<v Brian Okken>And the reason why I think about it when I see Teslas is because of these trucks.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:50.740
<v Brian Okken>So these tanks in there in the Megaforce kind of remind me of, well, just sort of the angles and stuff kind of remind me of Cybertron.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.840
<v Michael Kennedy>They do have that, don't they?

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.120
<v Brian Okken>Incredible.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.440
<v Brian Okken>Those are my extras.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.420
<v Michael Kennedy>I love that you're hopeless.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.020
<v Michael Kennedy>On Blu-ray.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.340
<v Michael Kennedy>wow that's is that a song I don't know it seems like it comes from the movie but I don't know

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.920
<v Michael Kennedy>look at the shot oh my gosh even the closer it's so bad cyber truck looking

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:24.380
<v Michael Kennedy>I want one of these though but yeah so you have any extra I this this is completely escaped me

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:24.840
<v Michael Kennedy>This is incredible.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:25.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes, I have extras.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.380
<v Michael Kennedy>So first of all, Brayson Daniel, who's been on the show a long time ago

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:37.760
<v Michael Kennedy>when we were having guests, wrote an article about whether,

00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:45.360
<v Michael Kennedy>well, has a project and a theory about whether LLMs think

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.440
<v Michael Kennedy>or if they're just pure statistics.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.940
<v Michael Kennedy>And as a good data scientist, created this project,

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Which here, yes.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:01.400
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's a literature review about whether machines think or don't think.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:08.300
<v Michael Kennedy>And so now it's got an LLM analyzing all the papers on whether LLMs think or don't think.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.640
<v Michael Kennedy>And you can say, so the premise is that they do not, right?

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.680
<v Michael Kennedy>So there's 97 papers that support it, but 13 that challenge it.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.540
<v Michael Kennedy>And if you go and look at them, you can actually hover over these.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's just a beautiful website.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Michael Kennedy>So one, I think it's an interesting, timely topic.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.840
<v Michael Kennedy>But two, it's just a really neat way to present information.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:30.340
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:31.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So well done, Preston.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:40.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Also, came across a new Mastodon app called IceCubes.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:46.060
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's free and open source if you're a Mac person, at least.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.060
<v Michael Kennedy>So I don't know.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.060
<v Michael Kennedy>I've been playing with this.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:48.920
<v Michael Kennedy>It looks nice.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I really like it.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Michael Kennedy>And having it open source, you know, we just, I don't know how you feel about this, Brian,

00:27:54.980 --> 00:28:01.020
<v Michael Kennedy>but I just don't usually connect open source and Mac apps, or sorry, iOS apps.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.320
<v Michael Kennedy>This is on both, but really I don't think, like phone apps and open source,

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.280
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't think about those being, I know there are some out there, but it's way less common.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, anyway, I just want to give it a shout out.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.320
<v Michael Kennedy>I thought it was cool.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.000
<v Michael Kennedy>I ran across it looking into something else.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.800
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, because don't you have to pay to be...

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I pay $100 a year

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.620
<v Michael Kennedy>so I get the privilege to publish to Apple.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.320
<v Michael Kennedy>So I pay $100 a year for the privilege

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.120
<v Michael Kennedy>to make Apple's products more valuable to them.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.180
<v Michael Kennedy>It's amazing.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.780
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I was just thinking that

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.760
<v Brian Okken>that might be one of the reasons

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.000
<v Brian Okken>why we don't see a lot of open source.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, exactly.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.780
<v Michael Kennedy>And then whose job is it to be in charge of it

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.239
<v Michael Kennedy>because it's not as easy to release

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.180
<v Michael Kennedy>because it's got to go through somebody's account.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.560
<v Michael Kennedy>It's just not that common, and I ran across this,

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:51.520
<v Michael Kennedy>and I thought it was really cool.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.780
<v Michael Kennedy>So I'm using this for my Mastodoning.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.120
<v Michael Kennedy>However, Mona, the one I was using before,

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.120
<v Michael Kennedy>has a really nice feature that if you write a thread too long,

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:06.100
<v Michael Kennedy>it'll split it into a series like 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3 automatically,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.280
<v Michael Kennedy>and this one doesn't have that.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.020
<v Michael Kennedy>But we could open a PR. How's that?

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:10.260
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.360
<v Michael Kennedy>All right, carrying on.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Remember we talked about RUMDL, R-U-M-D-L,

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:21.080
<v Michael Kennedy>which is a Rust-based markdown formatter in Linter?

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:21.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:22.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Which is really nice.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.520
<v Michael Kennedy>We've both been using it for various things.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, there's now a RUMDL IntelliJ plugin,

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:35.300
<v Michael Kennedy>so most of the people listening will care about that in terms of PyCharm.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.680
<v Michael Kennedy>But if you want to have that built right into your editor

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.460
<v Michael Kennedy>and you're using PyCharm, you can install the plugin,

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Michael Kennedy>And off it goes.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:44.940
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:45.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.220
<v Michael Kennedy>And then really quickly,

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.740
<v Michael Kennedy>the last time I talked about how curl,

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.280
<v Michael Kennedy>like you mentioned something about AI frustration

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Michael Kennedy>with some project or whatever.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And I pointed out curl.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.880
<v Michael Kennedy>So I'm linking to Ars Technica article that says,

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.100
<v Michael Kennedy>overrun by AI slop,

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.799
<v Michael Kennedy>curl scraps bug bounties

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.320
<v Michael Kennedy>to ensure that they keep their mental health intact.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.260
<v Michael Kennedy>So there was the PRs,

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.780
<v Michael Kennedy>the PRs that were like thousands of lines long

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.520
<v Michael Kennedy>and they were just kind of really messy

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.120
<v Michael Kennedy>and people were like, we're not accepting that.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.440
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't remember what project that was.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:25.740
<v Michael Kennedy>It's been a long time.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:26.220
<v Michael Kennedy>It's been a week.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Michael Kennedy>But I said that Curl's doing the same thing.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.900
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not exactly the same thing.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.720
<v Michael Kennedy>What they're doing is they had a bug bounty program.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, hey, well, we'll pay you $1,000

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.480
<v Michael Kennedy>if you find a memory overflow or something like that.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, a bunch of people were just turning

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Claude code or something loose on it.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.520
<v Michael Kennedy>They say, find all the bugs,

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Michael Kennedy>and then they were submitting whatever Claude code told them.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.860
<v Michael Kennedy>And apparently, a lot of times,

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Claude code got the understanding wrong,

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Michael Kennedy>so it wasn't really a bug, security bug.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.580
<v Michael Kennedy>And so the person that was just like,

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.160
<v Michael Kennedy>I cannot answer more of these,

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.420
<v Michael Kennedy>no, that's not actually a problem.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:01.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Here's why.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.700
<v Michael Kennedy>And the incentives were misaligned, right?

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Like with a PR, you're like, what is the incentive?

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe like, oh, I'm a contributor.

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:12.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, this they were getting paid for.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.640
<v Michael Kennedy>So they were getting overwhelmed.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, link into that for all the people who care.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:18.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:18.480
<v Michael Kennedy>And finally.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.000
<v Brian Okken>I think Curl's one of those like maintained by one person apps.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:23.900
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:24.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.380
<v Michael Kennedy>It's got, if not one, it's a very small team.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:33.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Finally, the PSF JetBrains survey for 2026 is on.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Have you done this yet?

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.040
<v Michael Kennedy>no

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I have not either

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.980
<v Brian Okken>it's that time of the year already

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.020
<v Michael Kennedy>I know

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.400
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah so anyway

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.500
<v Michael Kennedy>it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to fill out

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.520
<v Michael Kennedy>link into it

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.200
<v Michael Kennedy>everyone go out there

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.320
<v Michael Kennedy>fill this out

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Michael Kennedy>make your voice heard

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.440
<v Michael Kennedy>please tell them that CSS is not a programming language

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:53.960
<v Michael Kennedy>okay

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.240
<v Michael Kennedy>and you all use my test

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.380
<v Brian Okken>do not click no testing

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.060
<v Brian Okken>do not test

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:01.440
<v Michael Kennedy>exactly

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.080
<v Michael Kennedy>the second most popular testing framework is none

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.300
<v Brian Okken>yeah

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:07.800
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.860
<v Brian Okken>Which is great because it used to be the number one.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:12.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Progress.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Michael Kennedy>That's a form of progress.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.320
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:15.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Ready for a joke?

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:16.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.860
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't even remember what I picked for this,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.260
<v Michael Kennedy>so it's going to be news to me as well.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.340
<v Michael Kennedy>This is fun.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:21.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:22.760
<v Michael Kennedy>No, I don't care about that.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:24.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.060
<v Michael Kennedy>This is good.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.560
<v Michael Kennedy>So we've all heard of these license plates

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.100
<v Michael Kennedy>that have crazy stuff has gone wrong.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Like there was a license plate.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.140
<v Michael Kennedy>The person put null for their license plate.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Michael Kennedy>And instead of, because they thought that there would be a test,

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.220
<v Michael Kennedy>like if not equal to null, then send ticket or whatever.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.780
<v Michael Kennedy>But instead it's like if value equals null,

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.000
<v Michael Kennedy>and they started getting all the tickets.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.200
<v Michael Kennedy>So here's a car with a license plate that just says example.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.580
<v Michael Kennedy>And the title is when test values get pushed to production.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.600
<v Michael Kennedy>What state is that?

00:32:59.300 --> 00:32:59.700
<v Michael Kennedy>That's good.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.080
<v Michael Kennedy>What state are we looking at here?

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Maryland.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, so if you're in Maryland, there's an example car out there.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.140
<v Brian Okken>You get slugged for that.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's pretty fun.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.680
<v Brian Okken>Do your kids do the yellow bug thing or the yellow car?

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, yeah, yeah, the punch bug sort of thing.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, because when we were kids, it was slug bug or punch bug.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:21.280
<v Brian Okken>Slug bug.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.180
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, slug bug, yeah.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:32.880
<v Brian Okken>So my kids do if it's a yellow car or if it's a license plate with a state that's not adjacent to your state.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.480
<v Brian Okken>or your own state.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.500
<v Brian Okken>So like, yeah, for us,

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:38.800
<v Brian Okken>Washington wouldn't work,

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.860
<v Brian Okken>but like Montana would sort of thing.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.260
<v Brian Okken>So I'm like, that's just,

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.320
<v Brian Okken>you're just randomly picking things.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.860
<v Brian Okken>So I chose,

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.080
<v Brian Okken>it's any car that's not black

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.640
<v Brian Okken>or not a sedan,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.400
<v Brian Okken>which is, you know,

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.240
<v Brian Okken>actually, no, I chose black car

00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.440
<v Brian Okken>and not a sedan,

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Brian Okken>which now is most cars.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:02.520
<v Michael Kennedy>So anyway.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, you're going to get tired from punching your kids.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.260
<v Michael Kennedy>My kid does that as well, and I feel like it's just an excuse to go around.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.919
<v Michael Kennedy>They don't hit you hard, but, you know, just being silly.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Just taps because, yeah, yeah.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:21.540
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, so also we did this once like two blocks away from a Stanley steamer,

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.860
<v Brian Okken>which they're all yellow trucks,

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.960
<v Brian Okken>and we were waiting in line somewhere where there was like,

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.820
<v Brian Okken>we didn't know why, but like every five minutes,

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.679
<v Brian Okken>a Stanley steamer truck was coming by,

00:34:31.879 --> 00:34:32.860
<v Brian Okken>And we're like, this is ridiculous.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.480
<v Michael Kennedy>It's crazy.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.139
<v Michael Kennedy>Before we wrap it up really quick, Christian, out of the honest,

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:41.520
<v Michael Kennedy>gave us some interesting thoughts on the Apple,

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.460
<v Michael Kennedy>on the iOS not open source intersection.

00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:51.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Apple apps must be only available through the Apple App Store,

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:52.980
<v Michael Kennedy>which is interesting, right?

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.480
<v Michael Kennedy>The ones that are for iOS, not for macOS.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, Rick, even if you allow, yeah, weird.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.340
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, so that makes it difficult.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.560
<v Michael Kennedy>And says, GPL licensed software popular in open source

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.980
<v Michael Kennedy>is often incompatible with App Store terms

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.240
<v Michael Kennedy>because Apple requires control over binaries

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.900
<v Michael Kennedy>and does not distribute the source code.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:11.740
<v Michael Kennedy>So, interesting.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:12.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:15.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.100
<v Michael Kennedy>More to say on that in the not-too-distant future, actually.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you have more apps coming out?

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.720
<v Michael Kennedy>I have stuff to share, but I can't share any more than that.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:26.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Teaser.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Michael Kennedy>I've had a better experience this time.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.340
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll just leave it at that.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Don't touch that dial.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Anytime you have to interact with these app stores,

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:38.380
<v Michael Kennedy>you know, it's not the best.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.120
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:40.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Don't touch that dial for now.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Signing off though.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:44.180
<v Michael Kennedy>See you later, Brian.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:44.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Bye everyone.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:44.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Bye.
