00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.680
Hey, Brian. Hey, everyone. How's it going?

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.240
It's great. Good. Let's kick this thing off.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.060
Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.940
where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.240
This is episode 402, recorded September 23rd,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.940
2024. I'm Michael Kennedy. And I'm Brian

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.320
Akin. This episode is brought to you by

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.200
Scout APM. We'll tell you more about them later. If you want to keep up

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.140
with us or the show, follow us on Mastodon. Links are in the

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.160
show notes or over on X if you really, really want to. You can find

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.100
the links there in the footer of the website.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.340
We typically live stream on Mondays now. We used to do Tuesdays.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.000
Remember, we moved to Mondays. So Mondays, 10 a.m. Pacific time

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.640
on YouTube. If you want to check that out, we'd love to have you. Always great to have people in the audience,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.880
but certainly not a requirement.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.240
And finally, if you want to get

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.400
an artisanal,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.420
handcrafted summary

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.560
put together by your very own Brian Okken

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.100
about the show

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.780
right after it ships,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.020
sign up for the newsletter. Just go to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.780
pythonbytes.fm

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.380
right there and just click newsletter right at the front. It's probably the easiest way,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.680
actually.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.760
put in your email. We won't do bad things with it. We'll just send you

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.440
updates.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.760
So, and things about like horses and other stuff.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.760
Horses.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.360
Horses.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.800
Okay.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.460
Horses.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.140
Horses for horses.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.720
No, this is a totally different kind of show.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.480
We go down that path.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.480
Let's, what path do you want to take us down?

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.380
Actually, let's make some decisions.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.780
How about that?

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.520
Yes.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.100
Okay.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.160
I actually, this was suggested to me actually at a work setting.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.540
A friend of mine, Christian Gazelle said,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.240
Hey, architectural decision records are pretty cool.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.120
Do you use them?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.100
And I had not heard of these things.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.520
So I was excited to explore the rabbit hole.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.760
So this was a, there's an article that we're going to link to.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.040
This is the original from 2011 called documenting architecture decisions from Michael Nygaard.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.560
And, and it's, it, it's kind of this idea that you just have this lightweight document to,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.240
to discuss things like what you're deciding about, what the context is, what, you know,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.500
what, what, what the current situation is.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.400
And then the decision, what you're going to do.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.680
And so the context is why, why you're doing it.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.100
The decision is what you're going to do.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.140
And then, you know, status, like if you're, whether you're proposing it or whatever,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.580
I'm playing with status right now.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.020
So, and then the consequences, what you hope to will be the benefits of this decision.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.300
This seems like, like, like so silly and simple that it can't be helpful, but it is, it is awesome.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.060
And I've started using it just for a few days.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.180
So we're, we'll see.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.180
But so there's another article I'd like to link to.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:10.180
And it's from, from Red Hat called why you should be using ADRs or architecture decision records to document your project.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.860
And it's a, that's, that's a really nice, lightweight introduction.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.120
And it shows you basically, you just have a handful of things.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.020
And there's a bunch of templates people are using.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.980
I'm using Markdown.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.560
and I'm going to show you the, essentially the template I'm using.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.660
It's just a Markdown file.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.060
And I've got like a template, just a 000adrtemplate.md that I just copy, paste, modify.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.620
And it's just a few lines.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.680
And I've likely, sometimes I just put none in.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.380
If I'm not considering any options, I'll just put none, but I might fill it in later.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:58.780
But including pros and cons for options, this isn't, this is really only taking me a few minutes to get the stuff that I'm thinking about of the project and the things I want to change out of my head and somewhere.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:12.100
and since it's in Markdown and I'm storing it with the, with the code in the repository, it works great because, because the, because it's a GitHub or GitLab just renders it.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.840
It's Markdown.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.840
So it just gets rendered and it looks beautiful.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.480
but it's super fast to just write this down.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.960
and I'm, I'm already like, and so the step, okay.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:33.440
I want to talk about the status a little bit, the proposed status, the status that was recommended in the original is like proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.920
And it's kind of formally.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.960
So I've been using things like trying it out.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.300
haven't decided yet because I'm like documenting the process as I'm going.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:56.640
And I'm guessing like, by the time I say accepted, I'm going to stop editing this, these documents, but I've got a couple architecture things that I'm just trying out playing with, you know, do being agile about it.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:04.300
And, and it's helping me to actually go, even just back a day to say, what was I thinking yesterday?

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.900
And, and having that written down someplace.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.520
And then I'm also working with a remote team.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:17.400
So it's good to have the remote team to be able to like, they can see what I'm thinking by reading these docs and other people can do too.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.280
So anyway, highly recommend architecture decision records.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.120
Yeah, that's great.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:33.420
You know, one thing that's might be cool to pair this with is the old style GitHub projects, not the crummy new ones, but the good new, good old ones.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.540
Okay.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.160
Where you have Kanban boards and they go through different stages, right?

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:50.720
So the status could be the columns of your projects and you could have just a project for decisions and you could just see where they've gone and, you know, maybe, somehow reference.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.760
Yeah.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.980
I have a great issue or something to link it all together through GitHub, but that'd be cool.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.600
Definitely.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.480
And I've seen, there's a bunch of people that have done a bunch of extra stuff on top of this to make it more processy.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.760
But to me, now it feels official and I don't want it to feel official.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.100
I want it to just be like dumping stuff out of my head.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.180
There's also a different, a different thing of like, how much things do you put in there?

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.600
Is it everything?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.600
Is it, just big, important architectural changes?

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.500
And that you just sort of have, I'm just playing with it to see what it is.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.980
I'm not putting bug fixes in here, but I'm putting things like, I'm really changing a component, taking it here and moving over here.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.020
Why am I doing that?

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.380
All right.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.160
We're switching from FastAPI to flask and here's why.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.820
Something like that.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.980
Right.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.140
So yeah.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.700
Theoretically.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.240
Awesome.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.020
Well, let's go to the sea.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.960
Okay.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.560
And visit some narwhals.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.040
So I just had this, this project.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.120
had Marco Garelli on talk Python.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.680
This is a project he's doing a lot of work with and narwhals.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.920
It solves a problem.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.920
You can see their logo.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.560
If you go to their website is a pandas and a polar bear and a narwhal kind of hanging out behind them.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:17.180
And the idea is if you have, if you are writing a library that takes a data frame source, right?

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:30.680
So if you have users who are doing pandas and they want to, you want to write a library and say, Hey, send me your pandas data frame and I'll graph it or I'll analyze it or I'll do AI around it or whatever it is you're doing with it.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:39.640
You will probably get a message issue or something that says, Hey, we'd like you to use polars.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.800
How do I work with that?

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.380
I want to convert everything to pandas.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.020
I want to use polars.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.320
Like, now how do I take these two?

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:54.320
And then you're like, well, we actually use moden or we use, QPy for, GPU programming.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.800
Can we pass our data frames?

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.100
You're like, great.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.980
Cause nobody wants to convert out of their native framework into this thing.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.300
And it's just some other one.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.980
Cause it's probably going to make it slow.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.000
Like if you convert out of a GPU into pandas, well, what's the point, you know?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.320
So that's what the goal of this narwhals thing is.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:23.360
It lets you primarily, it's primarily for people who are creating graphing libraries, analysis libraries, others that can take all these different.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.040
frameworks.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.880
Okay.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.640
Right.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:34.700
And then what you do as the library writer is you use a subset of the polars API, a real simple one program.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.440
It comes from narwhals, but it's the same API, right?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.520
And so you basically do that.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:47.480
And then narwhals itself knows how to figure out which data frame library you're working with, how to work with it.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:54.140
If it's polars and it does, it's lazy operations, it won't turn it into eager operations.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.880
It'll continue to be lazy until it gets evaluated, which is really good for performance and memory.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:05.480
But if it's an eager API from pandas, also that very low or overhead.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.620
If you go check it out, full static typing, lots of promises of stability.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:16.080
Because the point is to be a foundational library for other libraries, not cutting edge new features.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:30.380
So anyway, if people are out there and they want to work with multiple frameworks for whatever reason, especially if you're creating libraries that you want to let people from different slices of the data science world use, then this is pretty awesome.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.600
So do you know, it's not converting things as it brings it in.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.300
It's leaving it in the native data.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.520
Yes, exactly.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.540
Yeah, exactly.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.600
That's part of the bonus here is that it does that.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:49.400
And then basically you write to the subset of the Polar's API, but then narwhals.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:49.760
It's okay.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.960
Well, is it really a pandas thing or whatever?

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.280
Yeah.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.200
What's the underlying thing?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.160
Yeah.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:55.580
Yeah.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:55.720
Yeah.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.080
Neat.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:03.700
I don't have a direct use for it because I don't data science as much, but I think it's cool and wanted to share it.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.620
It will be on Talk Python in much greater detail than I just explained.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.660
In a couple of weeks.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:17.180
You can find it on the Talk Python live stream YouTube section already, but the full edited version will be out later.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.480
All right.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.420
That's pretty cool.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.720
Yes, indeed.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.240
It sure is.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.220
How about we talk about our sponsor real quick, Brian, before we move on?

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.300
That sounds great.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.160
Let me tell you real quick about Scout APM.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.960
They're big supporters of Python Bytes, so we appreciate that very much.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:48.920
So if you are tired of spending hours trying to find the root cause of issues impacting your performance, then you owe it to yourself to check out Scout APM.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:58.480
They're a leading Python application performance monitoring tool, APM, that helps you identify and solve performance abnormalities faster and easier.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:09.820
Scout APM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks, slow database queries, background jobs, and the dreaded N plus one queries that you can end up if you do lazy loading in your ORM.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.840
Then you say, oh, no.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.200
Why is it so slow?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.560
Why are you doing 200 database queries for what should be one?

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.580
So you can find out things like that.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:25.000
And it links it back directly to source code so you can spend less time in the debugger and tailing logs and just finding the problems and moving on.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.720
And you'll love it because it's built for developers by developers.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.360
It makes it easy to get set up.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.900
Seriously, you can do it in less than four minutes.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.720
So that's awesome.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.780
And the best part is the pricing is straightforward.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:42.340
You only pay for the data that you use with no hidden overage fees or per seat pricing.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.000
And I just learned this, Brian.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.140
They also have they provide the pro version for free to all open source projects.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:58.480
So if you're an open source maintainer and you want to have Scout APM for that project, just shoot them a message or something on their pricing page about that.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.380
So you can start your free trial and get instant insights today.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.840
It really supports the show.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.620
Thank you.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.340
Yes.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.120
All right, Brian.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.600
Well, next.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:32.460
Well, next is a little bit of bizarre news from the Northwest.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.580
You're probably so I'm a little bit older than you, I think.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:44.700
So I don't directly remember it, but I kind of remember the meltdown at Three Mile Island.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.960
I'm 27.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.600
How old are you?

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.180
I'm just kidding.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.220
So I was born in 1970.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.300
So I was nine years old.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.620
So it wasn't really something I was completely aware of.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.780
But we heard about it later because it was kind of a big deal.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:06.280
So what this was was a nuclear facility near Seattle-ish.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:06.820
I don't know.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.100
I'm not that good at geography.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.060
Three Mile Island in Washington.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.200
And there were two reactors, and one of them did a partial meltdown.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.520
And it was a big thing.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.520
But it's the worst nuclear accident we've had in the United States.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.480
And, okay, so why am I talking about this?

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.820
Well, I didn't.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.860
I guess I didn't realize it was still operating up until 2019.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.240
Not those reactors.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.540
There were other reactors nearby, safer.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.520
I mean, and nuclear energy has come a long way.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:47.200
And actually, this Three Mile thing was the reason why we have a lot of the nuclear regulations we have now.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.740
It did sort of put nuclear energy on the back burner more than it probably should have been.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.140
And I'm not going to get into the politics of whether or not we should have nuclear energy.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.220
Too much.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.420
I didn't want to get into that too much.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.960
But what I am going to want to talk about is that it's going to start up again.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.380
Or it's proposed to.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.200
So it was closed in 2019.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.860
It might open again in 2028.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.760
And it's only going to be for Microsoft.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.700
This is the bizarre bit.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:29.700
So Microsoft wants to start this up again and have an exclusive 20-year deal for, what, 835 megawatts of energy just going to AI.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.980
This seems bizarre to me.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.340
So AI needs a lot of power.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.040
And yeah.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.040
So they're just going to hope.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.140
This is still in proposal phase.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.800
Regulators have to approve it.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:52.500
But we're going to start up another nuclear power plant just for Microsoft AI.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.600
This, I just don't get it.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.600
So there's that.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.460
And then it was, this was, we linked to the Verge article.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.960
I found it on the Verge.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.120
But then I searched for it again, some more.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.440
And there's a CNN article as well.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.560
And also, well, it looks like there's only one picture of this thing that's being used everywhere.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.440
Anyway.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.280
Oh, I guess that's a different picture.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.720
So going to start up again.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.860
It seems odd.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:30.600
And then in a related news, I guess that's all I just wanted to say is I think this is weird that we're going to start.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.720
A nuclear power plant just for AI.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.440
Maybe that's a problem.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.860
Anyway.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:41.920
The article I found was just, it's kind of a mock news article.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.940
But this is just McSweeney's internet tendency.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:51.880
The article is the Department of Energy wants you to know that your conservation efforts are making a difference.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:57.940
So I thought we were trying to like save the planet by saving energy and stuff.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.240
And this has got some interesting bits.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:11.100
It says, by turning off your lights all day, every day, you conserve about 1% of the energy needed for AI to generate a picture of a duck wearing sunglasses.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.260
Isn't he cute?

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:17.880
Aside from the fact that he has feet that are of a human man, of course.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.780
So AI is consuming tons of energy.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.440
And in the rest of our lives, we're trying to conserve energy.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.240
It's just a, I don't know.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.000
Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up as a topic.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.200
It just seems bizarre to me.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.700
So I'll leave it there.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.340
Well, so I love these.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:51.280
Let's put your feeling bad about wasting energy or your effort to save some energy in perspective.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.180
And it's just like, yeah.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:58.020
I mean, I still go around and turn off the lights after my kid who just like leaves them on.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.300
Well, yeah.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.860
And also, I've like stopped buying 25 cent light bulbs.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:10.120
And now we buy $8 LED light bulbs that last about the same as the other bulbs used to.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.180
And they are more.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.540
I mean, we're spending way more on light bulbs.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.900
Yeah.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.440
And for what?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.280
So that AI can have more energy, I guess?

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.440
Yeah.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.860
So on one side, I totally see the point there.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:34.620
On the other, if we're going to dump tons of energy into AI, I would much rather see it coming from carbon neutral sources than coal plants.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.680
You know?

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.420
True.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:36.960
Fair.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.240
Right.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.980
Like, are you going to make the duck or are you going to not make the duck?

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.440
Like, regardless of what light bulbs you're using, people are making ducks.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.980
And let's do that better.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.600
I think it's super bizarre that Three Mile Island is the choice.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:56.820
Because if there's anything in at least American culture that says nuclear energy bad, it's Three Mile Island.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.880
Like, couldn't pick anywhere else, you know?

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.320
Yeah.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.780
Well, they're going to change the name.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.500
It's going to be called the Crane Clean Energy Center.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.480
Oh, there's a good rebranding.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:16.180
That said, I'm super optimistic on nuclear energy as a climate solution.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:24.040
Not necessarily old school Three Mile Island stuff, but the molten salt reactors, the things that fail safe and not fail explosive like Fukushima.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.660
Right?

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.740
I know there's nuclear waste.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.140
I know there's nuclear waste.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.700
Those new ones are less bad.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:42.420
And, you know, I feel like a lot of the pushback against it, it's a little bit like, well, there's this rare endangered lizard in the desert.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.020
So we can't have in this desert any solar farms.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.040
It's like, well, if it gets 20 degrees hotter, there's going to be no lizards in the desert.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.420
We need to take some more positive action.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:58.020
And I feel like, you know, nuclear energy is that sort of in the extreme, right?

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.200
People have such strong reactions.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.720
But there's so much better attack now.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.300
And I would love to see that.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:17.440
Yeah, my personal views are that I think it would be good to utilize what we have, including nuclear energy, as a stopgap to get us off carbon-based fuel.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:32.120
And then once we get that, we can get carbon neutral, then we can go to, then we can beef, as we beef up solar and wind and everything, then we can maybe draw away from nuclear.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.160
That's a great way to put it.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.560
Like, let's get rid of the carbon pollution.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.160
Yeah.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.040
And then we can debate of the things that are working, which ones are working best very well.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:49.160
I also wanted to point out the excellent pun that you made, intentional or not, that with nuclear energy, people have strong reactions.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.040
Oh, that's very good.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.640
That's very good.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.880
All right.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.600
People might have a strong reaction to this as well.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.920
But I got to say, it's way less, way less out there.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.400
So here's the strong reaction.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:09.080
I think when people use Docker, so this is a Docker topic, when people use Docker, there's two philosophies.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:19.280
One philosophy is, I want the lightest weight, simplest, most basic thing that I can possibly use to build my containers so they're insanely small.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.340
Right?

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.000
I want almost nothing there.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.320
I just want, if it is not needed for whatever I'm trying to do to execute, it doesn't belong there.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.240
Let's get it out of there.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.700
Yeah.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.860
That's one side.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.060
This topic is not from that.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.960
This topic is from the other side of perspective.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.280
I would say the Michael side lives on, that I live on.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:49.540
And that is, Docker can be more difficult to understand what's going wrong, when something goes wrong, how do you fix it?

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.460
How do you get other tools to see what's happening inside there?

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.020
Right?

00:20:53.100 --> 00:21:08.740
And so I think there's a bunch of people that stay away from Docker because they're like, oh, I just want to have access to the logs and the tools that I normally use and all that kind of stuff inside my server or my VM so I can understand what's happening better.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.400
So one of the tools I really like is, oh, my Z shell.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.540
Right?

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.300
With all of its plugins, its autocomplete, its cool history.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:22.280
And so I present to you ZSH in Docker.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:35.220
It installs Z shell, oh, my Z shell, and the plugins like autocomplete for source control and for, you know, all the various plugins that you get.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:35.960
Right?

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.000
From Z shell, and it's one line.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:48.760
So you put this run shell out of this repo, and it just installs Z shell and installs, oh, my Z shell.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.560
It makes it the default shell.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.340
You just run it when you get into it, whatever.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.060
And then all the plugins, et cetera.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.000
So really, really nice.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:05.000
You even get to pick your theme as part of the one liner so that you can see, like, what version of Python is active.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.680
What is the state of a Git repo if you copied a Git repo in as part of setting up your Docker container?

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.180
And all those kinds of things.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.920
So super simple.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:23.040
If you believe in the, I want some tools inside of my container so when things are not working, I can exec into it and ask what's going on, then this is really awesome.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.680
If you don't want that, if you're on the opposite side, this is not for you.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.640
All right.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.260
Cool.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.140
All right.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.340
Indeed.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.500
So how much time do you spend in Docker?

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.740
Very little.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:44.980
But when things are not quite working or I'm trying to figure out a command, you know, maybe you've got a database running in there.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.480
You're like, I really need to see.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.700
I just want to see what's going on with this.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.580
And you know that inside the container, there's some database management tools.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:23:01.700
If you just Docker exec Z shell and then you start typing, it's like you're on SST agent effectively.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.040
Yeah, I'm going to have to check that out.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.480
So I'm changing my Docker.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:11.880
Like I used to use Docker a lot for like actually cross compiling C++ code.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.260
And I'm using it more now for web stuff.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.080
And so.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.940
Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:18.720
I think it's great.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:29.780
And obviously I do a ton of stuff with Docker and for running the web apps and things, but I don't go into the web apps unless I have questions.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.520
You know, but when you do, it's nice to just go.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.440
Oh, OK.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.780
Well, here's the thing.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.680
You just make this one of your base layers of your Docker image and it builds nice and fast.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.360
Nice.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.340
OK.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.360
Well, we ran through our topics.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.760
I don't have any extras today.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.920
You're extra less?

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.080
I'm extra less.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.580
What is the opposite of extra?

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.940
I don't know.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.060
I got a few.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:55.800
Basic, maybe?

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.600
I guess.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.540
The bare minimums.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:10.000
OK, so first one is I remember I spoke about this thing, this uptime Kuma a while ago.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.480
Uptime Kuma is great.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:17.100
So it's self-hosted, free uptime monitoring.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.180
OK.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:27.160
Well, I put in a bunch of things like, for example, if you go to Python Bytes and you go to the bottom and hit server status, it'll show you the server status of Python Bytes,

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.500
how old the SSL search from Let's Encrypt are and all those kinds of things, right?

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.200
Very cool.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:40.240
Well, I turned that on all of my web things, including my personal blog, which this might resonate with you, Brian.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.660
It's my personal blog built with Hugo, which is a static site.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.940
So it cannot crash.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.420
It is HTML, CSS image.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.160
Like, it can't crash, right?

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.400
And I thought, oh, I'm going to host this on Netlify because Netlify is pretty awesome.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.460
Right?

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.300
Right.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:04.080
Well, I started getting every single day or every other day.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.740
Your site has a 502 error.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.580
And it's been down for 10 minutes.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.220
Now it's back.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:11.960
It's been down.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.880
What?

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.080
How could it possibly?

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.280
It's a static site.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:21.960
So something about the Netlify infrastructure was going bonkers.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:34.400
And I will tell you, if you already have an Nginx server laying around somewhere, it's about eight or nine lines of code of Nginx configuration to just host it yourself.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.880
So I switched this over to running on server that runs all the other things that I got.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.600
But because Netlify was crashing.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:50.120
So I think the takeaway is not that mkinity.codes, my personal blog, website, et cetera, is hosted anywhere different.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.900
Like, why do you care?

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:56.540
But if you're hosted on Netlify, maybe point some uptime status at your thing.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.340
Even though it's a static site, shouldn't fail.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.780
Look at it anyway.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.240
Mine was for a week or two.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.880
At least two weeks, it has been all sorts of broken temporarily.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.360
So is it better now?

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.440
Yeah, it's perfect.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.100
Because why would it have any problems now?

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:12.700
It's on our server.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.880
Yeah, it's better now.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.260
Okay.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.360
Okay.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.120
So that's number one.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.900
That's just check that out.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:28.700
Number two, over at Talk Python, if you go to the courses and you go to the apps,

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:38.280
we have a really nice new version that came out, I think, last year of our mobile apps for all the courses, including Brian's pytest course.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:38.980
You can take it that way.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.060
The one that comes from Talk Python, that is.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:50.800
Well, the guy who wrote this, Lauren Augie, I had him on Talk Python when we talked about Python and mobile apps, along with some other folks.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:58.180
Anyway, he used to be a live sound engineer until COVID hit, and then he moved over into software development.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:03.060
And he wrote up a really detailed story of his life journey.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.020
And I just wanted to share that.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:10.720
If people are interested in that, maybe you're making that transition as well, then check that out.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.120
It's pretty cool.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:11.660
That's pretty cool.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.280
Yeah.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:21.040
This other short one comes to us from Itmar Turner-Trowing.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.960
It says, it's time to stop using Python 3.8.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.960
I can't believe that.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.780
But it is.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:37.000
He puts it onto our radar that, you know, 14% of the packages downloaded from PyPI are for Python 3.8 installations.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.800
And by the way, next month, it's going end of life, out of supported, no security fixes, nothing.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.740
So you might not want that to be your foundation if you get to choose.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.440
We got like seven days left in September.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.660
It'll be fine.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.600
I would say it's, yeah, five weeks.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.660
What could go wrong?

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.200
Anyway, just put it on your radar.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.600
Maybe Python 3.12.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.800
It's been out for a long time.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.960
Version 6 of that just came out.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.580
So I think we're good.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.420
You know, 3.12.6.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:14.700
I also want to add to that, that since like, it's been years since I've ever had any significant issue upgrading.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:23.200
At most, I'll see deprecations that I have to go through and clean up or warnings or something.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.820
But maybe other people have, but I haven't had any issues for a really long time upgrading.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.020
Yeah.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.140
Same.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.860
I did have an issue with, I can't remember.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.060
There was some, it was packages that didn't support 3.12.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:47.340
There was some deprecation in there that I had to wait three or four weeks before I could start using 3.12 when it first came out for some of my apps.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.000
However, that's not the same as to say that Python itself is unreliable.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.520
You would know right away if the imports fail or whatever, right?

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.000
Like, you'll find out straight away.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:13.700
Yeah, and I don't remember the reason why, but on a couple of the projects that I've converted from 3.8 to 3.12 work projects, I jumped from 3.8 to 3.10 with no issues or minor issues and then to 3.12 fairly easy.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.420
And for some reason, it just helped me to go from 3.10 and then 3.12.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.260
Yeah.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.940
But anyway.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:20.440
Nice.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.380
Your mileage may vary.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:34.860
It's these kind of things that if you don't do it, you eventually end up saying, we have a 2.6 app and a half million lines of code and it's still running on Python 2.6.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.980
So don't talk to me about your fancy new libraries and your typing and your async.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.420
We're just trying to survive.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:46.580
But if you get into the practice of just like, okay, let's just keep this stuff moving.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.340
All those steps are generally small unless you try to take them 10 years at a time.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.580
You're stressing me out, man.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.280
PTSD from 2.6.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.440
All right.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.320
Last thing.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.520
So passkeys.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.180
Let me ask you really quick, Brian.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.720
Are you a passkey user?

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.480
Yes.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.240
Well, passkey is in...

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:05.440
A believer.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.660
Well, yeah.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.860
I use passkeys.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.320
Yeah.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.100
I do too.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.120
I've been resisting using passkeys.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:20.320
So passkeys are cryptographic, kind of like, almost like SSH keys, but for the normal folks,

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.880
it's for just web authentication, right?

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:27.300
It's a cryptographic thing blob that gets put into your whatever thing is signing in.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:31.600
And if it shares that back, it's supposed to be dedicated to that instance.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.440
It knows it's you.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.860
Often you can skip to a phase.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.900
All those kind of things, right?

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:46.200
One of the things that really turned me off on passkeys is they felt to me like a couple

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.540
of the tech giants are like, hey, this is a sweet opportunity for lock-in.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.800
So let's see how much lock-in we can get.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:56.400
You know, Android and Apple especially, right?

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.900
Like, hey, just save your passkey to your iPhone.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.760
What could go wrong?

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.560
I was like, well...

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.560
I could lose my iPhone.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.620
Yeah.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.840
If I could lose my iPhone or even if it's synced to iCloud.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.680
Like, what...

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.160
I have a smart TV that says, you know, log in with your password.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.840
It's a super pain to type in, but you can do it.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.560
Or maybe I'll go over to my Windows PC and I have to type in some password to log in.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.620
A lot of times it'll say like, oh, your Microsoft account is expired.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:23.880
It's log in.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:28.160
Log in again at the boot screen so I don't get access to anything.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.800
It's like, oh, my gosh, this is a pain.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:36.300
But those situations get way worse if you have passkeys that are dedicated to, you know,

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.600
one provider, right?

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.960
That's just a mega lock-in.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:46.860
So I realized that if you're a one password user or I think also Bitwarden, I'm a user of

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.280
both of them and I really like them.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:52.860
If you store your passkeys there, all of a sudden, they live everywhere.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:53.360
It's beautiful.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.960
And if your computer gets destroyed, just log into one password or Bitwarden or whatever

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.960
again, and you have them all again.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:06.220
So if you, at least for one password, if you go into the watchtower, there's a section that

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:12.000
says, show me all the sites that could have passkeys that I don't have stored passkeys for

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.280
here.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:19.120
And it'll help you go through and basically add them to one password, which is a form of

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.620
lock-in, but a much lower grade form of lock-in in my feeling.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.240
All right.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:30.020
So anyway, I am now a believer of passkeys, I believe.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.120
I went through and did that this weekend.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.280
I added like 35 accounts or so that have passkeys.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.700
And now life's a little easier.

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.640
Like GitHub, for example.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.460
Yeah.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.080
Nice.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:41.340
Yeah.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.420
So.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.340
All right.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.940
You have the joke for us this week, do you not?

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.740
I do.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.800
And actually, I thought it was going to be a topic.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.860
I just had it in my, in my backlog of how to monetize a blog.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.680
And then I started reading it and realized this is just a hilarious joke.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.740
And I love it.

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.160
So I wanted to bring it up here.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:10.560
So, and you should either, if you're listening and not, not on YouTube, you should watch the,

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.720
watch the video version or just go check it out yourself.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.640
I'll, we'll have a link in the show notes.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.220
Okay.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.100
So how to monetize a blog.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:23.040
It talks and I actually thought it was going to be advice, but it's just funny.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.480
Maintaining a blog can be a lot of work.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.440
I started reading it.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.800
You don't really need to read it.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.800
There's some fun font that shows up right away.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.980
Like, like here's a, it can become a fairly lucrative venture and the become is in this wacky font.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.320
I love the M.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:38.800
That's cool.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.920
and then, so you're going down and you've, you see these various things.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:49.560
Like, like timber quest, advertisement, your lumber yard awaits you, my Lord.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.140
play now.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:57.280
And almost all the, the clickable things, if you click on them, they just like pop up little coins.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.120
you don't actually go anywhere.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:08.800
and then talks about slapping this bad boy here can start raking in some cash through true primary means CPM or CPA.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:16.380
and, and then you just sort of, if it's sort of seems reasonable, but it says, look, look, how am I doing so far?

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.400
I've, I've made 0.123 cents.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.120
so far on this.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.240
and then, you, it, it just adds it up.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:30.120
There's different, various, various little links around that.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.500
If you click on them, it increases the, how much money this person's made, even though it's not real.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:42.520
but if you, I just started reading the ads, like there's an ad for a minimal effort graphic design.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.000
no proof, figging time saved.

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:49.220
There's the ads are hilarious.

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:59.880
Here's one, free cruise, sign up today, with eligible purchase meeting or exceeding value of cruise after which no purchase is necessary.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:06.160
Like, of course, click on that guy for some extra, extra sense.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:10.140
let's see, I'll read one.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:18.520
The more clicks and grizzly bear sales you can squeeze out of your beloved readers, the more of their money you can siphon to spend on cheeseburger deliveries.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.260
And of course, cheeseburger deliveries is clickable.

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.480
It's gotta be an affiliate link, right?

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.060
Yeah.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.100
All these things.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.000
let's see.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:35.600
here's a little, a little weird thing, ad on the side that looks like a Amazon or eBay thing.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:44.340
Friendship assembly, 1595, collapsible bivalve, and a, that which molts beneath enclosures.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.560
Toy.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.060
This is bizarre.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:48.800
I love these.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.980
I want to scroll down more.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:56.220
Literal snake oil, vials of freshly squeezing, squozen oil from actual snakes.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.940
befriend a sandwich.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.540
No doctors allowed.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.880
The first mystery grab bag of unmarked vitamins is free.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.180
oh, and then it pops up.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.340
We get a pop-up, push notifications.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:16.880
Would you like to enable push notifications so you can receive intrusive alert messages like these outside of the browser?

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.580
Yes.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.540
Or ask me later.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.440
I'm going to say yes.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:23.440
I'm going to say yes.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:23.440
I'm going to say yes.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:23.440
I'm going to say yes.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:23.540
I'm going to say yes.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:23.580
I'm going to say yes.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.780
And see if you got a coin for that.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.720
Yeah, maybe.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.940
Let's do it again.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.500
Another one.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.460
Yes.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.120
Oh, yeah.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:29.760
Oh, you did.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.920
You're making some money for that.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.120
Yeah.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.000
And, a weird pop-up cheese cube burger now open.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.540
let's see.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.580
We soon become.

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:42.880
Oh, it's too bad you can't see this.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.940
This one is, ice cream holding tips.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.860
there's, we have radishes that will change your life.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.960
Add, let's see.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.180
huh?

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:58.700
Oh, these, these are my, these are just my mind rending God radishes.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.580
old school.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.660
excuse me.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.680
A virus was detected on your computer.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.940
Send bitcoins.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.700
It's like a Solaris window.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.800
oh, anyway.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.640
And then you, you just sort of scroll down.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.820
It just comes, becomes even more bizarre.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.660
You've got side noise text.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:24.460
and then, the spiral.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.760
This is awesome.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.540
I don't even know.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.660
So I was like, how do they do some of this stuff?

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.200
It's pretty cool.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.440
It's pretty cool stuff.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.860
That's how you monetize.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.560
That's how you do it.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.140
Yeah.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.840
If you go all the way down also in the, if you actually start reading it, it says stuff

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.820
like there's not actually, you just sort of have to spew out lots of words.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.940
I didn't even edit this.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.060
and then way at the bottom,

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.040
there's a credits, how this was made.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:53.420
And then, this person goes through and walks through, basically all the different,

00:37:53.420 --> 00:38:00.540
uh, procedures for how, like how to do the spiral, how to do the cool font, and all

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.200
these sort of tricks, with HTML and CSS and whatnot.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.940
So anyway, just a hilarious little, blog on stupid ads.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.040
That's awesome.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.160
Andre out there says, this is art.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.760
This is definitely art.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.100
Yeah.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.040
Not art, but real-time follow-up.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:27.140
Bitwarden also supports passkeys, which Bitwarden being open source and the paid version is insanely

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.200
affordable.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.740
it's like a dollar, a couple dollars a year or something.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:38.500
I can't remember exactly what it is, but maybe that's the proper recommendation there, for, for

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:38.920
passkeys.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.320
But anyway, okay.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:40.580
Pretty cool.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.020
Yeah.

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.340
Cool.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.120
Yeah.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.020
Well, let's call it a show, huh?

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:45.620
Yeah.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.160
Sounds good.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.060
All right.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:47.940
Well, thanks for being here.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.400
Thank you everyone for listening.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:49.920
See y'all later.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.480
Bye.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:50.520
Bye.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.520
Bye.
