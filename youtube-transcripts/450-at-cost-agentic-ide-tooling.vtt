And finally, if you would like an artisan handcrafted digest put together by Brian about what we've talked about on the show, a bit of a deeper dive into the background and some of the topics and more resources, not just a rehash or email version of the show notes, go to pythonbytes.fm, click on newsletter, enter your email.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.440
We'll be gentle to it, we promise.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.520
Now, Brian, I would hope that you would also be gentle to pandas and other zoo animals.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.420
Yeah, yeah, of course.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.340
Well, let's, let's, what's going on?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.060
There we go.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.440
Thanks.

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.400
Technical difficulties getting the screen on.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.160
So this, I'm going to talk about PD call, which is columns in pandas.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.580
These are not here yet.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.400
So these PD call expressions are coming to Pandas in the next version.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.720
I think the next version.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.360
Well, more about that later.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.600
Anyway, this comes to us from Marco Garelli.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.600
He wrote the article.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.600
And what he's talking about is a new call expression within Pandas and with PD data frames.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.920
So taking a look at, he also linked to the merge request.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.920
So let's take a look at that.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.420
There's an enhancement, introduce pandas.call.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.100
That went in and was merged on August 22nd.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.640
So why I'm saying it's coming in the next version.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.520
So it came in on August 22nd.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.540
The most recent version of pandas looks like it was released on August 21st.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.700
So it's not there now.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.360
So whatever the next one is, maybe 233, maybe 24.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.660
I don't know what they're going to bump, but it'll be there soon.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.040
So what are these things?

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:29.900
So in the past, there's pandas, but then there's other things that pandas has inspired, like I'm blanking on all the names, but there's a bunch of other type pandas-like things that do similar stuff.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.340
So they have the call syntax already, so that's just coming back into pandas.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.220
So what is this?

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:47.180
So when you want to talk about pandas columns, in the past, a lot of times you had to come up with these, use these lambda expressions.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.380
So like lambda x for x temp, specifying a column.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:02.020
So you kind of select it with a lambda expression because you want the expression to happen not outside of the data frame, but in the context of the data frame.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.660
So it's, you know, there's some trickiness in doing that.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.340
So really, that's what's going on.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:17.940
And the article we're going to link to talks about using lambdas and then kind of times where that just doesn't work right.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.959
There's some flakiness that happens with lambdas.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.300
Doesn't always do what you might think.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.520
And then introduces using columns instead.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.280
So the syntax of using instead of the lambda, just doing pd.call.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:05:10.520
passing in a column name um that's really all i wanted to talk about it was really this is pretty cool i'm and i'm looking forward to being able to use this column there's new things coming also along these lines so some of the other things that that some of the other tools use is things like um uh pd all to select um multiple columns that's not that's not in this one yet um But there's other multiple expressions and PDL selectors and other things that they want to bring into Pandas.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.120
But this is a good starting point.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.440
This is great.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.160
I love it.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.620
I love to see it getting better.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.560
You know, Pandas is definitely the primary way people do data frames.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.380
And there's some young snappers nipping at the heels like Polars and others.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.940
So great to see some of these ideas being brought back.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.720
Yeah.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.680
Absolutely.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.300
Now, let's talk about whippersnappers for sure.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.920
The young vibe coder type.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.620
No, I want to talk about agentic code, certainly not just for vibe coding.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.360
So I actually have been doing a lot of cursor lately, and I really like it.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:06:00.440
I think it's, at some point I have more to say, but I think it's pretty stunning what you can do these days with agentic AI coding.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:14.580
I talked to Matt Makai a few weeks ago on Talk Python about he was using ColladeCode and NeoVim, but these agentic tool-using coding AIs are just unbelievable what they can do.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.580
They all have their own little variation, which is kind of funky.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:30.220
Cursors like a VS Code fork, but then Microsoft said, hey, maybe we shouldn't just let everybody just take our stuff and redo our business model against us, which is absolutely fair.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.760
so they cancel a bunch of stuff.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.240
So it's not quite VS Code, but it's kind of VS Code.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.500
There's Claude Code, which is terminal-based.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.380
What I want to mention today is something called Klein.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.540
And I think the idea of it, if you're at all inclined to care about the AI coding thing.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.980
Inclined.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.440
Inclined.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.160
Very good.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.320
If you're at all inclined to care about the inline coding thing, then Klein should be pretty interesting to you.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.140
Why is that?

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.920
First of all, it works in pretty much all the places that you would care about.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.120
It works in VS Code, VS Code Insider, Cursors, Cursor, which is interesting.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:19.820
This and OpenAI's codecs both install into Cursor, which is a separate product with its own AI coding thing, but it's just using a different pane if you don't like it or you run out of credits or whatever.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:29.000
But it also installs, and this is one of the main reasons I'm bringing this up, is JetBrains IDEs, in particular PyCharm, but many others as well.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:40.260
So if you want to bring whatever model you want to PyCharm, or to VS Code, or whatever, then you can do that.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:46.380
The other thing is places like cursor charge a percentage on top of inference.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:56.980
So if you pay-- let's say you do $10 worth of work, That would basically be what Claude or the OpenAI API charges cursor.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.280
They're like, all right, well, 12 bucks is what you pay.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.420
With Klein, this is open source.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.600
You can see 51,000 GitHub stars.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.300
So it's open source, and it doesn't charge for inference.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:23.800
What it does is you can either give them a credit, and they'll pay it along to whoever you pick in your dropdown, or you could just put in an anthropic API key or an open AI API key, and then that's your model.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.480
And they're not involved in that transaction, which I think is pretty interesting.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.200
The other thing that's kind of cool is they have a very distinct plan versus act mode.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.320
You can see in the screenshot at the bottom, it has a plan and an act.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:51.880
And one of the things you can do to be way more successful on complicated AI jobs is to say, please plan this out, write it down in a markdown file, and then come back and say, now you can act.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.920
Let's do step one and work through that.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.200
Now let's do step two.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.540
It'll keep the context smaller.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.540
It'll keep the thing a little more focused and so on.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.220
So that's pretty nice.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.000
Yeah.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.020
You can do that with other ones in the prompt, but it doesn't always behave.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.540
You say, let's plan this out.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.560
It's okay, we planned it out.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.500
Now I'm doing it like, no, no, no.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.300
I just told you to plan it out, right?

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:21.400
The other thing, if you look at the UI on the client homepage, it actually has a price that updates as it's working.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.260
Like how much is this costing you?

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.640
It goes zero cents, three cents, five cents.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:34.900
Not when it's done working, but like as it's working, the dollars are like click, click, click, click, click, which is really a lot of other tools.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.680
It's very like, I have no idea what this costs.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.140
Oh no, I'm out of credits or I've spent a bunch of money, but this one you can just watch.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.580
So that's cool.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.660
Yeah, I like it a lot.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:51.120
It's got open source for sure, so complete transparency so that they're not profiting on inference.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:10:01.220
Universal model access, so if OpenAI or Anthropic come out with a brand new model, it'll show up right away because you're just passing through to their API, right?

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:11.380
And it says client-side architecture means your code never touches our servers, essential for security, mandatory for many enterprises, and ensures data sovereignty.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.760
I played with this a little bit in PyCharm, and it's quite nice.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:23.040
I think I will still be using cursor, but I'm keeping my eye on this because I think this is pretty neat.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.700
Cool.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:26.500
Yeah, anyway.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.100
Believe it or not, AI has still not disappeared as a fad.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.620
It may still, but probably not.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.940
All right, over to you.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.080
Okay.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.740
I was just going to talk about uv a little bit.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.880
Are you going to cheat?

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.380
You're not going to cheat, are you?

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.920
Yeah, yeah, I am.

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:55.020
This is thanks to Rodrigo at MathsPP, MathSPP.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:55.820
I'm not sure.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.680
Anyway, he's got a great blog about software and Python and stuff.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.600
So uv Cheat Sheet, I really kind of, I mean, uv at first was, oh, great.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:33.960
can you use it instead of like pip and and now it does a lot of stuff so what all does it do it's a lot now the documentation over it uh at for uv is pretty good already but i kind of like this so what what does he's got he's got like just all of the commands that you probably want to remember around creating projects like all the inits and how to how to do a net stuff like if you're going to do an app or a library.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:39.060
And I kind of forgot that they added these app and lib flags.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.320
That's pretty cool.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:46.480
I did too, and I made a lib, and I forgot and ran it in app mode, and I'm like, darn it, I messed it up.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.860
But yeah, it's really great.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:12:00.280
And then project management dependencies, of course, being able to modify your PyProject.toml and stuff using UVAdd and uv lock.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.020
I guess I didn't notice also there's a uv tree.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:03.700
That's neat.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.200
Didn't know that was there or forgot about it.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.900
Lifecycle management.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.360
What does that mean?

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.520
Things like build, publish, bumping the version.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.640
And I haven't played with these either, all the different ways you can bump a project version.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.040
That's pretty cool.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.880
I'll have to play with those.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:35.740
Things like managing tools, like all the tools, like uv tool run uv tool install these are these were uvx kind of isn't uvx and uv tool the same

00:12:35.900 --> 00:13:12.520
thing i think yeah no almost uvx will run a tool but then it's like ephemeral it doesn't last where you really you install it so you might say uv tool install i don't know pi test and then you permanently have py test as a thing that you can run but if you say uvx py test it'll download run py test and then it will it'll kind of disappear from your system is that you know what i mean oh yeah okay they're they're similar but not exactly the same oh here it is right here uvx is

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:19.840
an alias for uv tool run there you go nice yeah it's the uv tool run but not uv tool install and

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.640
and then run the tool.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.820
Yeah, that's what it is.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.100
Working with scripts.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.280
UVNN run for scripts.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.940
And I haven't done this.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.740
I guess initialize the script and run it, things like that.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:34.480
Neat.

00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:38.220
Oh, wow, I didn't know you could do this.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.640
You can add and remove dependencies within a script.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.360
Oh, that's pretty neat.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.260
Yeah, and I think it writes the little header, the PEP client header at the top for you.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.520
That's cool.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:14:20.380
yeah i totally okay i'm learning a lot just uh i thought it was just a cheat sheet for me but i'm learning a lot so this is great um and then of course um uh if you control which pip which python versions are installed on your computer using uv um cheat sheet on that list install uninstall things like that so nice uh i've been i've been using i didn't think i would i really didn't think I'd be switching to something else to install Python.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:31.040
But yeah, I'm especially trying to keep up on new versions with 3.14 and stuff. Definitely using uv for that.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:40.560
And then a handful of old time stuff like actually old timers like uv, VNV and UVPIP. That's where we started.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.860
I love it. uv format to run ruff. Update.

00:14:46.779 --> 00:15:15.960
this is one of the things that that i always forget about uh well i remember that it's there but i forget to do sometimes is if i'm on a different machine that i know that has uv but i haven't updated it for a while and i try some something new like installing a new version of python and it doesn't see it i'm like what's going on um if things don't work try a uv self-update and it probably will work that so yes good cheat sheet who said cheating will never get

00:15:15.980 --> 00:16:40.520
anywhere. We learn stuff here. Yeah. We did. Well, speaking of sneaky things, I want to talk about Ducky. So Ducky is an open source, all-in-one desktop app built in Python. It's designed as the perfect companion for network engineers, students, tech enthusiasts, and others. And it combines a bunch of essential networking tools for you. Okay, so I have the thing itself and then bit of a stealth take on this okay so it has a UI down here and it does a bunch of different things you can say I would like to it actually has a nice SSH client you can use to connect the things it does tell net and bringing back the mud days serial communication all different things so if you look at some of the tools it's got a terminal kind of like we talked about but also network queries, subnet calculators, port scanners, topology mappers, like how is my whole enterprise network put together, and here's the sneaky bits, vulnerability scanner, password checker, hash calculator, and so on. So a lot of cool things you can do in this UI. It's Windows only, so I think that's turnabout is fair play a little bit, Brian, because we talk a lot about Mac tools on here, and I'm going to talk about macOS specifically before the show is over.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.380
So we don't usually cover some Windows-only tooling, but here we are.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.060
Yeah.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:46.820
Yeah.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.520
So it's still pretty good.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.660
I think this is kind of the thing you might run in, like a big company enterprise.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.600
You want to understand your network topology, your search vulnerabilities, and things like that.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.700
Or you just run it in a VM.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:01.980
Pretty neat.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.040
Like I said, open source.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:04.920
Yeah.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:10.500
So here's the stealth bonus.

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:13.620
This is a pretty cool looking desktop app.

00:17:14.459 --> 00:17:15.579
I can go over and download it.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.040
Let me see if I can zoom back a little bit to get to the releases.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.120
It's pretty new, by the way.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.060
I can come over here, and I can download this.

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:28.540
And presumably, inside there is going to be a.exe that I can run or whatever.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:29.960
Right?

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.180
Oh, now it has to install it this way.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:32.600
Interesting.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:33.780
It doesn't compile it.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.360
Oh, it does contain an exe.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.540
Yeah, OK, so it does contain exe.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:44.620
Or you can install, run it as an entry point script thing in the pyproject.toml.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.920
Anyway, so here's part of the stealth thing.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:54.380
ducky.exe application-- keep that in mind-- as we compare it against an all-in-one desktop app built in Python.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:04.660
You don't see too many fully compiled, built, executable desktop apps of any variety these days in Python.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.140
I know there are some, but not too many.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:06.880
So this is cool.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:08.880
Yeah.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:15.160
Actually, I don't even remember the last desktop app I installed at all.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.300
We live in a weird world.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.560
We do.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.160
Oh, yeah.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:23.580
Yeah.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.600
Anyway, that's it.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.600
That's Ducky.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.540
I think it's super new, not super popular, but I think a little shiny light on something cool.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:31.780
Yeah.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.260
Nice.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:32.880
Cool.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:33.600
Cool.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.180
Mm-hmm.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.460
All right. Is that it for our things?

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.560
Over to the extras.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:38.900
It is.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.580
What do you got?

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.840
Normally on extras, we will share something extra that I want to point out and share with people.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.080
But this time, I guess I'll share one article, but mostly it's a question.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.300
I'm curious what everyone is using for.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.020
So I've got a, my blog is static site, Hugo.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.460
And I'm currently on Netlify, but I'm like, should I be on Netlify?

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.740
And I ran across this article from Will Vincent.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.340
This is moving from Netlify to Cloudflare pages.

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:16.100
But that was published in February of last year, of 2024.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.840
So curious if it's still valid.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.260
And that totally doesn't look like Will from what I remember Will looking like.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.800
But it's a cool picture anyway.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.400
Anyway, so he's got an article on converting.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.700
and so I might consider Cloudflare.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.780
But why I'm bringing this up is because Netlify changed their plans a little bit recently.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:44.280
And right now, you're already there, you're grandfathered in to whatever you had before.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.660
But if you want to change around, they're doing this credit thing.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:58.780
So the free plan, like if I was going to recommend somebody new to blogging, any of these would probably be fine because there's no traffic yet.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:08.780
But as traffic grows, and traffic grows weird now because of AI bots and everything, even if there's not that many people reading your site, there might be a ton of bots reading it.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:19.660
So that 300 credits turns into like 30 gigabytes per month, which, you know, you can hit that not too hard.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.100
If you have a big hero image or something like that.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.480
Yeah, probably, you know, probably do the images down.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.100
But stuff gets pulled a lot.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.500
Anyway, so there's that on Netlify.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.180
And to go up, it's $9 or $20.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.940
None of this is expensive, but it adds up over the year.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.500
So Netlify's here.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.200
I did look up.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:49.160
I knew some people were using GitHub Pages, but GitHub Pages has a usage limit as well.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.060
And I didn't realize this.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:21:05.520
It says it's not intended or allowed to be used as a free web hosting service to run your online business, e-commerce site, or other website that's primarily directed at either facility and commercial transactions.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:06.760
Blah, blah, blah.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.700
Anyway, I've got ads on my site, so I was like, I don't think it would be bad.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.580
I think that would be sort of not in line with the terms.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.820
But also there's 100 gigabyte soft bandwidth.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.540
So that doesn't seem right.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.860
Cloudflare Plagiot Cloudflare pages.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:36.420
Looks like they don't have a bandwidth limit on the free plan, which is interesting, and unlimited sites.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.760
So I might check that out also.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.100
Also, not just because of the cost.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.480
Even $20 isn't something terrible.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.220
But I'm not thrilled with Netlify's analytics that they present.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:56.760
And I was just curious if anybody has any other ideas for what you're hosting your static sites on.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:57.300
Let me know.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.640
But you've got static sites, but I'm assuming you're self-hosting those.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:03.740
Yeah, exactly.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.239
They were on Netlify for a while, and I had monitoring for all my different sites for downtime.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:15.020
And I think I said this before, but I noticed they started having weird one-minute downtimes.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:15.780
I'm like, that's weird.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.240
How can a static site reasonably have downtime?

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.260
But no, it was quite a bit.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:28.120
And so I'm like, well, how much work would it be to just put it on the same infrastructure that runs Python bytes and all the rest, right?

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.420
Turns out, not so much.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:42.040
If you can just get clone your Hugo site somewhere and you point Nginx at it with the right configuration, you now, ta-da, have a, it's exactly the same as if it's hosted at one of these places.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:49.540
and then update you just run a remote ssh get pull command and then boom, it's instantly updated.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:54.600
So if people want to know how to host Hugo or whatever in static sites, shoot me a message.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.320
I'm happy to help.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.000
I don't necessarily recommend it to everyone because now you have a server you've got to deal with, right?

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:08.520
But if you already have a server and already have Nginx doing all the stuff, it's trivial to just add a config to point at a folder.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.680
Yeah.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:19.640
Yes, that's kind of why I was sort of leaning towards what's a hosted thing that's cheap, either free or cheap.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:27.800
And I hadn't, before I ran across Will's article, I hadn't heard of Cloudflare.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.820
I can't say that.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.220
Cloudflare pages.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.300
I hadn't either.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.000
But I wonder if there's others out there that I'm not even noticing.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.520
So yeah, let me know.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:37.800
Very cool.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.000
Love it.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.680
All right.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.540
I have a few extras.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:43.440
Okay.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.180
Of which Ducky is not one.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.740
So I apologize.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.420
I can't remember the guy who sent this in.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:57.240
But Python Brazil has sort of reached out and said, hey, we could use a little help with funding.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.960
The PSF had a bunch of funding and grants for different things.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:09.840
And there was a huge spike in how many grants were requested, how many people asked for funding.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:16.540
and it burned through the available funds quicker than expected, I think is the short version.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.940
There's been a bunch written about it, and that's probably roughly right.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.300
Anyway, they said, hey, we could use some help.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.000
We don't have as much funding as we expected.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:34.360
So give us a shout-out, if you don't mind, about Python Brazil coming on the 21st to 27th, I believe, in October.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:49.740
And if you go to check out and you actually pull up the buy me a ticket, like check out pop up or modal dialogue, whatever it is in there, there's a way to donate a ticket for a student to attend.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.000
So you can just go there and say, I would like to basically fund a student's attendance.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.780
So anyway, that's kind of cool. Check that out. Hopefully the conference goes well for them.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:08.000
Next up, Brian, to atone for my sins, I've mentioned in a Windows-only application, I will speak of macOS.

00:25:11.099 --> 00:25:12.440
So I don't know.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:18.080
Have you installed macOS Tahoe or iOS 26, one of these new shiny liquid glass things?

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.260
They're doing it on the desktop also?

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.280
No, I have not.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:28.000
My daughter has updated her phone and has been cursing it since she's updated.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.080
Funny.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:46.600
Yeah, so I updated my phone, I updated my work computers, but not my streaming computer, because the UI stuff with screen recording and all that kind of stuff, it can get a little weird.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.360
So I decided the one that you and I are talking on right now is going to stay stable for a little while.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.620
But the other ones I upgraded, I think it's delightful.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.380
I know a lot of people hate change, and they're like, it's changed, and I don't like it.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.000
And that may be valid or not valid or whatever, but I think it's great.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:04.740
I've been enjoying it.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.120
So the clear isn't bothering you yet?

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.640
No, nothing is unreadable.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.000
I don't have it in the full tinted mode.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.240
I just took the default because it still has color.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:23.940
I hate that they drew the color out of it like a vampire sucked the joy out of it or whatever.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.340
So can you get colors back in your icons if you could get those back?

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.380
They don't even change by default.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:34.100
You have to go and select the super clear view if you want that.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:34.740
Oh, okay.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.000
It looks almost exactly the same.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.820
It's just a little more transparent.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.120
Like the menu bar across the top, the background is transparent.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.040
But depending on what your background looks like, it's either fine or not fine.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:51.400
I don't know.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:52.500
But for mine, it's fine.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.300
So, yeah, it's okay.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.280
Anyway, I know a lot of people are saying they hate it.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.040
And I'm like, I actually kind of like it.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.740
I don't mind it at all.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:01.820
That's great.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.820
I'm glad that you're happy with your computer.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:04.740
Thanks.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.020
I mean, there's things that I would like to have transparent.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:14.920
Like, for instance, if I'm actually usually using a computer or phone, not while I'm moving.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.960
So I don't really need to see what's behind it.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.380
If I could have books be transparent, then I could walk around and read at a different time.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:24.660
That would be cool.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.760
I remember when the iPhone first came out, there was an app that was basically a messaging app.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.460
It wasn't iMessage.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.640
It was some other kind of messaging app.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:39.360
But literally, the background was the camera view out the front, the back, what is it?

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.460
The camera that looks away from you.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.480
And so you could hold it, and you could read your messages, and it would show you what you're walking towards.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.680
How messed up is that?

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.620
Well, I think that's great.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:28:00.000
I mean, like, actually, if you could do, like, a panorama side view, too, because I'm always weirded out with people crossing a crosswalk while looking at their phone.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.500
And I'm like, there's cars and bikes and stuff.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.640
You're going to get hit, man.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.500
I know.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.040
Yeah, whatever.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:06.960
Kids these days.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.160
Speaking of software things, also, I'm 100% back to Vivaldi.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.300
I'm not using Zen anymore.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.100
I'm just embracing the Vivaldi lifestyle.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:22.800
Really? This surprises me because Vivaldi's taken a stand against AI.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
I don't need my browser to do AI.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:30.400
I think I actually, you know, you're going to take us down a rat hole.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.020
I hate the AI that is in almost every application.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.100
You know, my email client has a rewrite this email with AI.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.360
Gmail has a, would you like to like shorten this or tighten it with AI?

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.280
And I almost always hate what it does.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.960
It almost always destroys the formatting or something.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.720
I'm like, oh, my, what is this?

00:28:49.540 --> 00:29:01.500
So I'm not a huge proponent of everything having AI in it, but going like, I'm going to go to ChatGPT or I'm going to go to some AI coding thing, and now I'm using it as a choice.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.540
That is good, but just having it jammed in really poor implementations everywhere, don't love it.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.180
Yeah, so they did make a big stand against AI, which is interesting.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.120
Yeah.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.400
Okay, I have one more thing left, a quick follow-up here.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.200
The one thing that didn't work was Alt Tab.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.700
Have I given a shout out to Alt Tab, Brian?

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.060
Alt Tab is awesome.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:31.120
One of the things that really is a bummer about macOS is you can Command Tab instead of Alt Tab, which seems like the same thing, but no, it's not.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:41.500
Because if you have, let's say, three browser windows or three editors, and you want to go between Editor Window 1 and Editor Window 3, no.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:50.420
There's not really a hotkey for that, right, other than switch to the app and then do an expose all windows and then use your mouse.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.240
It's really janky.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.140
So Alt Tab cycles through windows, not apps, which is really nice.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:03.420
So if I'm already in Vivaldi and we've got three windows up, you can cycle through the-- Yeah, Alt Tab.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.180
You just map it to Alt Tab.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:10.360
And then Alt Tab will cycle between the different Vivaldi windows and all the other windows.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.320
It's like Windows style, not Mac style.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:13.400
Oh, that's pretty cool.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:13.960
And it's open source and free.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:14.520
It's pretty nice.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.840
Okay, before we hit our joke, I just want to, why will this not go?

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:21.160
There we go.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.680
James C. on the audience asks, what about GitHub Pages as an option for your static site?

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.800
You pointed out that there's some limitations you don't like, right?

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.800
I sort of flew by it, and I can't go to my screen because I already deleted it.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:41.200
But the gist of it is I'm actually doing decent traffic, so I'm already hit.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.320
I am close to the 100 gigabyte.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:31:33.980
and they said that github pages is close to 100 they have a soft 100 gigabyte limit and i've already taken all all the big stuff off it's just a lot of i think it's a lot of ai bots and i decided to not turn that off um but the uh uh the other thing is it says it's they really don't want it to be for free web hosting for anything commercial or even like pseudo related to commercial and so I, in the spirit of that, I don't, I'm not afraid of getting in trouble. I just don't think it's right for me to take advantage of it if I'm promoting my courses, promoting my book and stuff and on there. It just doesn't seem like in the spirit of what GitHub Pages was for. So there's that.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:49.240
However, you're right that when I started the story of recommending other people start a blog, totally GitHub pages is going to be one of those because if you're just writing a blog like in college or something, probably not a commercial entity.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.600
And that's totally valid.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:57.560
Just remember the admonishment we gave a few weeks ago.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.160
Use your own domain.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.680
Because if you want to move, you need to be able to move by remapping your DNS.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.160
If you're at, you know, Michael at githubpages.com or whatever, right?

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.760
Or github.io, like you're stuck forever.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.080
Yeah.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.180
But then you'll, yes.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:21.220
And you'll get to the joy of now you have to get to learn how DNS settings.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.580
But, you know, you should anyway.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.080
You'll figure it out.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:26.200
Yeah.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.680
By the way, my self-hosting comes with free four terabytes of traffic.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:35.540
And if you're a DigitalOcean or Hetzner, usually even the cheapest server comes with a terabyte of free traffic.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:37.640
I think the $4 version.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.180
Well, maybe I'll set up a $4 Hetzner box or something.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:43.280
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:43.680
You could.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:45.960
I'm happy to help if you want.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.280
All right.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.920
Are you ready for a joke to wrap this thing up?

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:49.300
Okay.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:51.560
So I'm going to recommend a YouTube video.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.920
I know a lot of times I tell straight jokes, but I feel like this one is catching the zeitgeist a little bit.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:02.060
and people can, I think with a certain group of people, this is really going to resonate.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.540
Are you looking for a job?

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.640
Have you looked for a job five years ago?

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:15.640
And then now, well, check out Kai Lintitz, hiring in 2025 versus 2021.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.840
This is the programmers are human guy.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:26.060
The interview with the Emacs expert guy, the senior JavaScript developer.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:32.780
And perhaps his best video is the senior engineer tries AI coding.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.160
But this is really, really funny.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:47.900
It sort of like contrasts like the position that we all used to be in, whereas you could just dictate whatever terms you want in 2021 because people are desperate to hire anyone.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.720
And then what it's like now.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.960
They make the guy create like a foundational LLM model blindfolded.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.400
But here, I'll give you some of the quotes.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:03.860
In 2021, these are some of the quotes.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.180
Do you have an in-house kombucha sommelier?

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.500
What country did he study in?

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:14.580
Oh, yes, we actually have two.

00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:19.980
And then it's like, let's talk about, this is the guy being hired, right?

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.020
Let's talk about pets.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.399
Are you donkey friendly?

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.320
And the guy starts to laugh like, oh yeah, whatever.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.919
He's like, oh no, you think this is a joke?

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.159
He's like, oh, well, we can work on donkeys.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:28.659
Yeah, it's okay.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:35.659
And then 2025 is like round eight of seven for the interviews, right?

00:34:37.419 --> 00:34:40.740
And the guy starts screaming at the guy being interviewed.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.879
Out of 12,000 resumes, the AI picked yours.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.020
Prove that you're worthy.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.120
Do you solve with the binary tree?

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.720
Build me a foundational model.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.639
And then eventually he asked about healthcare.

00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:54.320
He goes, healthcare, what do you want to live forever?

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:56.840
So good.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:57.780
Oh, that's bad.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:58.580
Yeah.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:03.140
So if you want to just live in the moment a little bit, I think.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.820
Here we go.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:09.800
So, yeah, in 20, so pre-2019, I guess.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:19.000
So pre-pandemic, it's been since there's not enough people always in the office to support it now.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:25.320
But before the pandemic, we had two flavors of kombucha on tap, chilled.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.860
It was like a mini keg thing, but it was kombucha.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.160
It was a thing.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.220
Incredible.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.200
And then also- Where did your Somalia study?

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.800
No, we just, it's Portland.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.220
It's just kombucha people.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:40.820
I know, I know, I know.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.620
The one, this is related to AI in 2025.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.920
My daughter, she's a junior in high school.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:58.340
And she had to, for one of her classes, she had to interview me, interview one of her parents.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.340
So she interviewed me.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.880
And she was starting to type it in on her phone.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.360
And I'm like, don't do that.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.800
Just email me the questions.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.420
So she emailed me the questions.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.720
And I just sat there and talked with her about what I was saying.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.720
But I typed it back because I type way faster than she does.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.800
Although it's bizarre that she can type with her thumbs faster than she can on a keyboard.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.420
But send it back, turned it in.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:29.200
But she had to convince her teacher that it was okay that she pasted it in.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:34.480
Because apparently there were so many kids that actually didn't want to actually interview their parents.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.360
They told ChatTPT what their parents were like.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:47.440
had the, or whatever, the AI system, AI bots, they interviewed a bot instead of their parents.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:54.800
And so the teacher turned off paste in the homework assignment. So you can't paste in the answer

00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:13.140
anymore. How bad. I mean, I do not envy the educational world with regard to AI because you know it's so easy to say and here let me just paste the homework question and requirements in

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:32.999
now do that you know it's crazy but this was like there's no wrong answer it was like it was easier just easier than ad talking to your family uh but yeah yeah that's crazy anyway all right yeah that's cool uh well good one again thanks i'll have to watch that uh

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:39.500
hiring video. Oh, it's really good. It's really good. People check it out. I'll put it in the show notes. Bye everyone.
