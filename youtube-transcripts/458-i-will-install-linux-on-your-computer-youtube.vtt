<v Speaker 1>really getting a lot of value of that.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Brian's putting that out.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>And yeah, it's really nice.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the links of the show notes, but it's extra deep information,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 1>background information, that kind of stuff.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>And the joke.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Always the joke, Brian.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Always the joke.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.480
<v Speaker 2>And we put a link to the joke if we can find a link to the joke in the newsletter as well.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the joke has a link, and sometimes it's just like a dad programming joke,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>and it just has words.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.160
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to talk about first?

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I actually want to talk about Django.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh, really?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 2>and actually kind of lightweight i want to talk about the django website um i i guess i heard

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 2>about this but there was a discussion about maybe maybe redesigning the django website it's been like

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 2>the same for a while um and it works um it's good but um there is i i noticed uh adam hill put out a

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 2>mock-up for what the Django website might look like.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 2>So here's his new one.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 2>And I'm kind of liking it.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I like the animated thing at the top.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 2>It's the task framework.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh, my gosh.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Did Django just jump like 20 years into the future?

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.260
<v Speaker 1>From where it was to the current day.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.600
<v Speaker 2>It looks pretty good.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.080
<v Speaker 2>It's got like search documentation at the top that's really easy to find.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean, I guess there was, yeah, there's no, I don't know where you have to, the search documentation isn't at the top here.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I like the search there.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm liking it.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I like the, I like the, just the life of it feels, feels good.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I think that maybe we should go with it.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 2>But, you know, it's just my vote.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 2>But you can, you can join the discussion too if you'd like to help out.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.400
<v Speaker 2>And there is some assistance that Adam Hill is okay with.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.780
<v Speaker 2>So there's, and it's not just him.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting a link to a discussion where he announced what his little, his demo.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.540
<v Speaker 2>He said, I'd love help with in the form of PRs to the repo, explicitly not looking for drive-by critical feedback without PRs.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.320
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I guess here's my drive-by feedback.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.140
<v Speaker 2>I like it.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Speaker 2>I know that's not really feedback, but I do like it.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.160
<v Speaker 2>But you can read, it looks like he kind of picked this up off of other,

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.900
<v Speaker 2>there was other work.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Just a reminder that this doc informed my approach.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.340
<v Speaker 2>So there's another document about things.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.200
<v Speaker 2>I didn't look at it, actually.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 2>But the discussion's been going on for a while.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.200
<v Speaker 2>If I scroll to the top, there's been a discussion on,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 2>how do you do this?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Up to September 21st.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh, it looks like he started it.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.720
<v Speaker 2>that maybe we ought to redesign the website.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not too long then, September 21st to now.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 2>But I think that it'd be cool to give.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Why not?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Let's go for it.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.540
<v Speaker 1>You know, I think, look, Django's a web framework.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 1>It should not look like it's 15 years old

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.460
<v Speaker 1>and outdated and rusty.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it's a project that's getting tons of love and attention.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a really good idea to make it feel like it belongs at the

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>cutting edge of web development these days.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, just that website is aged fine,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a long time, right?

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, it is a long time.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.620
<v Speaker 2>But also, even if the, it should be a,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 2>to make it feel alive also, the website could be, it could change also.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Not that, I mean, even if this one doesn't, I mean,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is great and this will be great for the new one.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.700
<v Speaker 2>It'll be great for a long time,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think that we should be tweaking it on a regular basis just to,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.380
<v Speaker 2>to make sure people understand that it's still, still moving.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.840
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, absolutely. And hat tip to Adam Hill.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.340
<v Speaker 1>That is a very nice looking website.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I think it's neat. Plus I love the, I gotta say,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 2>I love the documentation at the top, the search docs, because that's,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.819
<v Speaker 2>I often just go there because I'm used to going to a project homepage to search

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:47.100
<v Speaker 1>the docs. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very cool. All right. What you got? I want to dive into some

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>concurrent database stuff. So I want to talk about AIO SQLite pool. So there's three concepts here,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:04.539
<v Speaker 1>asyncio, SQLite, and then a connection pool type of thing. So normally you just work with

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.280
<v Speaker 1>SQLite and it just says, hey, let's go open up all the infrastructure to talk to the SQLite

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.540
<v Speaker 1>database and do your work. And then it closes it. Then it opens it. Then it closes it. Then it opens

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.640
<v Speaker 1>it. And that's not necessarily the fastest way to do that. Maybe you could just leave it open.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>But you don't want to leak these connections or have a whole insane ton of them open. So instead,

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.020
<v Speaker 1>the idea is to use this connection pool. So you say, instead of give me a connection, you say,

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.240
<v Speaker 1>give me a connection from the pool, right? And it'll keep a certain number of them open and hand

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>them over to you when it needs or wait. If there's already 10 connections running queries, you probably

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:48.280
<v Speaker 1>can just better off to wait and try to hit it with another. So that's what this is. And it's not

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>a replacement. Maybe people have heard of AIO SQLite. AIO SQLite is a way to talk async and await,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.700
<v Speaker 1>but to SQLite. And all this is a little bit funky and interesting because SQLite is a file

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.860
<v Speaker 1>that runs in process. It's stored as a file and it's a thing that runs in your Python process.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.200
<v Speaker 1>So you're not going out to the network and waiting and that kind of thing. But this AIO,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.460
<v Speaker 1>SQLite gives you an async programming model. But the way it works is you create a connection,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 1>do a query, and then when you do async with, when that with block, that context manager closes,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.360
<v Speaker 1>the connection's gone, right?

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.820
<v Speaker 1>So over and over, it's kind of up and down, right?

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.200
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is this AIO SQLite pool

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.700
<v Speaker 1>wraps this SQLite library for basically three core problems.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.520
<v Speaker 1>One, it tries to eliminate connection overhead

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.140
<v Speaker 1>by avoiding repeatedly opening and closing syscalls,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 1>mem allocation, teardowns, all that kind of stuff, right?

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Which I already described.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.619
<v Speaker 1>It also has the advantage of potentially faster queries

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 1>via hot cache. So long-lived connections keep SQLite's in-memory page cache hot, right? Like,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.940
<v Speaker 1>so once a database has seen a query, it has to look at the query and say, okay, we're going to

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.340
<v Speaker 1>come up with a query plan. Do we use this index? Are there any indexes? How are we going to sort it?

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Is it a table scan? There's all these things, right? And that has to be determined for a query.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:22.440
<v Speaker 1>So it could be kept around and reused better, potentially, and maximize the connection throughput.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of stuff in here and some examples and so on.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Again, similar programming model with connection with async width,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 1>but you get a connection from the pool.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere down here, though, there are some stats, I do believe.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.419
<v Speaker 1>Yes, the very, very bottom.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:42.919
<v Speaker 1>Here.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:50.699
<v Speaker 1>It says just doing 100,000 complex read applications across 20 workers

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.220
<v Speaker 1>with a reasonable-ish database setup,

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.400
<v Speaker 1>5 million comments, 10 million likes, 100,000 posts.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And so like real data, not just like,

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.160
<v Speaker 1>there's three items, query them.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Which one is the, you know, which one's bigger than one?

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, with all that, it says,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.640
<v Speaker 1>what's your throughput without the pool?

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 1>You get 3,000 operations a second.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 1>With it, you get 6,000.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Basically for all the metrics you care about,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like a 2x improvement almost.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Not quite, but almost.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.640
<v Speaker 1>So like throughput's almost double.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.660
<v Speaker 1>The latency is almost half, more than half, better than that.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 1>So on, right?

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.160
<v Speaker 1>So instead of 60 milliseconds, it's 20 milliseconds response time,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.700
<v Speaker 1>So why not, you know, if this is easy to use?

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to, like, maybe I'm dense,

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.920
<v Speaker 2>but I can use this and I can have multiple async

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.400
<v Speaker 2>or multiple parts of my process

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.020
<v Speaker 2>accessing the same file at the same time?

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, SQLite supports concurrent access.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:59.120
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you're reading,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no problem reading the file in parallel.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.520
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, if you're doing SQLite stuff

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.240
<v Speaker 1>and you're doing async stuff, check this out.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.460
<v Speaker 1>There may also be a SQLite pool that is not async.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I haven't looked at that.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.040
<v Speaker 1>But once you get to the point where you're like,

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about concurrent speed access to my database,

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.180
<v Speaker 1>you know what?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.580
<v Speaker 1>You might just, you're probably already in async land anyway.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.960
<v Speaker 1>So here you are.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.020
<v Speaker 2>So the answer is, yes, you're dense.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to answer you anyway.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 2>But no, thanks.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, yeah.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:32.900
<v Speaker 1>All right, over to you.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.040
<v Speaker 2>I am going to, I'd like to talk about dependencies a little bit.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Last week, I think it was last week,

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:50.140
<v Speaker 2>we talked about,  uv tree or, you know, pip dep tree and uv pip tree. and those

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:56.880
<v Speaker 2>are great things. a similar, it's the sound similar, but it's not,  I'm going to talk about

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:03.140
<v Speaker 2>dep tree D E P T R Y. And I'm pretty sure this was recommended by somebody, but I can't,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't find the reference. So I'm sorry for losing your name, but thanks. thanks to

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:19.340
<v Speaker 2>everybody for suggesting topics. So Deptree is D-E-P-T-R-Y. And what it does is it's a command

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 2>line tool to check for issues with dependencies in a Python project, such as unused or missing

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:34.920
<v Speaker 2>dependencies. So the idea is like, so I appreciate the unused part. The missing dependencies,

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably going to catch and test, but hopefully, but maybe you don't have thorough

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:39.620
<v Speaker 2>tests.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.120
<v Speaker 2>So if you're importing something and it doesn't show up in your requirements file or your

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.680
<v Speaker 2>pipeproject.toml, it'll flag that.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.360
<v Speaker 2>And the reverse is true too.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:55.260
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a dependency listed, but maybe you refactored your code, you're not using

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.820
<v Speaker 2>that dependency anymore, it'd be nice to find out that you don't need it.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty much what it does.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.040
<v Speaker 2>but i really wanted one and so that's and it's pretty easy you install it in your project

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:17.160
<v Speaker 2>and um and then you run it and it scans everything um and lets you know if hey you've got uh for

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:23.100
<v Speaker 2>instance um numpy is imported but you didn't declare it as a dependency and it does have this

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:31.520
<v Speaker 2>idea of uh development in dependencies um versus project dependencies and that's the part that

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 2>trip me up a little bit that it that's the switch it's either development dependency or uh or a

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:46.760
<v Speaker 2>project dependency and it's it's unfortunately like super easy to get started and really easy

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:54.820
<v Speaker 2>to get tripped up by it and i got tripped up because um because i use um i use optional

00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:03.040
<v Speaker 2>dependencies for tests often so i'll do something like uh like list test and as an option in my

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:08.600
<v Speaker 2>project toml i'll say project optional dependency for test i've got pi test and all my pi test

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:15.860
<v Speaker 2>plugins um and then maybe uh maybe doc for docs for um all of my like make docs or something to

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:22.259
<v Speaker 2>build the documentation pretty standard but um what deptree does is it finds these optional

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 2>dependencies and just includes them in your normal dependencies because it might be your CLI or your

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:37.400
<v Speaker 2>GUI, which is interesting. I guess I don't get why your GUI or your CLI would be optional, but

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe two choices. I don't like it either, but I think I've seen it like I want to install this

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.779
<v Speaker 1>and only have the CLI or I want to install this and I do also want to have the GUI and the GUI

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.360
<v Speaker 1>install might be super heavyweight.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.900
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean? It's just a way to say I want

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 1>less instead of

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.640
<v Speaker 1>the union of all possible

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.340
<v Speaker 1>use cases.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Actually, I... Oh, cool.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I've got a... I wonder if I can work this

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.780
<v Speaker 2>in test suites because there's times

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.640
<v Speaker 2>where I want some of it. Anyway,

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting off on a tangent, but I think this would be

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.040
<v Speaker 2>fun to play with with test suites.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Why I'm going down this rabbit

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.900
<v Speaker 2>hole is because the most common thing

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:19.760
<v Speaker 2>of...

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:26.960
<v Speaker 2>and configuration it's way it's like buried in here but if i look for a py test uh i'm gonna

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:33.280
<v Speaker 2>have to look for it a couple times i guess here we go so optional dependencies uh test of py test

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:42.060
<v Speaker 2>you have to list it out as you have to add this big pip dep tree or tool dot dep tree and

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:49.880
<v Speaker 2>then pep621 dev dependency groups this is kind of verbose guys but uh that's what you got to do

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 2>if you do that it all works fine because i i just like tried this out on a simple project and it

00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:00.500
<v Speaker 2>said you're in you've included py test but you don't import it anywhere no i don't import it

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 2>anywhere i'm using it for my test do you understand what this is for so um i'm a little thrown that

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe I'll suggest

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.960
<v Speaker 2>that this, that

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.600
<v Speaker 2>their example of using

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.400
<v Speaker 2>the dev dependency

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.820
<v Speaker 2>groups are at the very least

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.820
<v Speaker 2>test and docs.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.400
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that should be the default.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should have to declare that.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.440
<v Speaker 2>You know, if

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.580
<v Speaker 2>you've got a tests or docs,

00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:32.560
<v Speaker 2>it's probably

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.320
<v Speaker 2>a development dependency.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.720
<v Speaker 2>But anyway, I had fun with it.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I tried it out.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I do like the, it's not a whole bunch of rules.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.020
<v Speaker 2>The rules are like,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.060
<v Speaker 2>projects should not contain missing dependencies,

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 2>should not contain unused dependencies,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.680
<v Speaker 2>should not use transitive dependencies.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:54.720
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, I kind of agree.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't depend on,

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 2>if something's getting imported or installed

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.900
<v Speaker 2>because you installed something else,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.020
<v Speaker 2>that third-party package might refactor and not include that.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.800
<v Speaker 2>So yeah, you should probably be transitive.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Anyway, I think a fun project,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.160
<v Speaker 2>and yeah, I'm going to check it out a little bit more.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Very cool.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Henry out there says,

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.720
<v Speaker 1>those tests and doc dependencies

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.860
<v Speaker 1>should be dependency groups nowadays.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't do nuanced stuff enough to know.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So yes, thanks, Henry.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for that homework, Andrew.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes, exactly.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for the homework, man.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.980
<v Speaker 1>So you know what?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I could find myself on a server or just the terminal,

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.420
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to figure out why are some of my dependencies missing?

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Where are my files even?

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.240
<v Speaker 1>What's going on, Brian?

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.380
<v Speaker 1>And I came across this thing called Jephton Browser.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Drop the E.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little bit too Web 2.0 E, but it still has the O,

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:01.800
<v Speaker 1>so I don't really know what that means.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, what it is, is this is a really neat tool

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.360
<v Speaker 1>that is basically an interactive,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.900
<v Speaker 1>like keyboard-driven and mouse-driven experience,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.079
<v Speaker 1>like a Finder or Windows Explorer,

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 1>but for your terminal and works over SSH.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.079
<v Speaker 1>So if I SSH into a server, I can say browser in a folder

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.400
<v Speaker 1>and it gives me a tree of all the folders.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I can arrow through them, I can click through them and then expand.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.820
<v Speaker 1>And when you click on them, it will show on the right the file

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.780
<v Speaker 1>and on the left the tree of the area starting from where you ran it and down.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that cool?

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 2>That is pretty cool.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, and it has basically the viewing for the files.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 1>It has context highlighting.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.480
<v Speaker 1>You can even show images and a couple other things like that.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.260
<v Speaker 1>So really neat.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.120
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you're doing anything super terminal-based,

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I know you can run on your local machine, but I don't know.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Here's a little tip for people who don't know.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a folder on macOS, you can type open space dot,

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.020
<v Speaker 1>and that will just bring up Finder there.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.920
<v Speaker 1>In Windows, you can say start space dot,

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.980
<v Speaker 1>and it will open up Windows Explorer focused in that folder.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.040
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in the terminal and you want like a GUI-like thing,

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:24.980
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty close.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.840
<v Speaker 1>You're pretty close to having it.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.300
<v Speaker 1>You've got to type browser anyway if you want to get this thing to start.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 1>But if you're on an SSH connection to a server, well, there is no alternative but to just LS your way through.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.400
<v Speaker 1>And this is a really nice way to just kind of flip through and exploit what is in here.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.460
<v Speaker 1>And as you move through the files, it displays them with syntax highlighting.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I like it. I think it's super, super useful.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.040
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be part of my server maintenance toolkit, I think is what I'll say.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, it's fun.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:03.680
<v Speaker 2>You know, I'm also one to possibly just use open dot for that,

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.360
<v Speaker 2>but also just cheat and just say code space dot and open

00:19:10.419 --> 00:19:12.040
<v Speaker 2>and have the tree directory.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I think the O is necessary in the name so that it's bro.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.160
<v Speaker 2>So bros are maybe.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Bro.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Fair.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, and if you don't, it's not on the GitHub, I don't think,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:32.120
<v Speaker 1>But if you click their domain, which is effectively like a read the docs type of thing,

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you can actually see it in action with a little animated screen recording.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.580
<v Speaker 2>We love animated screen recording.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.880
<v Speaker 1>So, so nice.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.200
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.400
<v Speaker 1>What do you got?

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Extras?

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I just have a show and tell extra because I went to an estate sale a couple weeks ago.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.120
<v Speaker 2>and I got a fun gift

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.300
<v Speaker 2>or a fun little thing that I just

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.760
<v Speaker 2>picked up.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.200
<v Speaker 2>I was going to show it off.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.240
<v Speaker 2>I got this book

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.640
<v Speaker 2>called Micro.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Understanding the Micro.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.700
<v Speaker 2>It's microcomputers,

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.520
<v Speaker 2>how they work and what they can do.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.160
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of fun.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.940
<v Speaker 2>It's for kids and stuff.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.640
<v Speaker 2>In the back,

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a buyer's guide.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.000
<v Speaker 2>And I flipped back and I'm like, well, does it have mine?

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.320
<v Speaker 2>And yeah, sure enough, the TRS-80 Color Computer.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.640
<v Speaker 2>That was my story.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Ooh, okay.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Fun little book.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.020
<v Speaker 2>And I haven't read much of it yet, though, but it should be fun.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.840
<v Speaker 2>It even talks about basic programming and stuff like that.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.720
<v Speaker 1>You see, Brian, I was definitely later in the computer hardware game.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.180
<v Speaker 1>My brother had a Commodore 64,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 1>but I saved up when I was in high school,

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.840
<v Speaker 1>and I got myself a 486 DX.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Not the SX, but the one with the floating point processor

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.400
<v Speaker 1>and 33 megahertz.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.840
<v Speaker 1>That's where I started off.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that's close to what I had.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.799
<v Speaker 2>I think I must have been ahead of you a little bit

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I bought a 486 IBM 46 when I was in college so I could do homework on it.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I think the first thing I bought was Turbo Pascal for it.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I think the first thing I got was MechWarriors.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.060
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Well, there's a whole bunch of stories from that era, but let's go back to this era.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.780
<v Speaker 1>And I just want to say, since you gave the recommendation of John Papa's Peacock,

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I've been playing with it.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:51.920
<v Speaker 1>It is so good.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.520
<v Speaker 1>It's fun, right?

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.520
<v Speaker 1>It is really, really useful.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:22:02.140
<v Speaker 1>And what I didn't realize, the way it works is if you're in something like Cursor or VS Code or whatever,

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.600
<v Speaker 1>and you have to create a workspace, not just open a directory.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:15.060
<v Speaker 1>But once you create the workspace, it embeds your styling for that project into the workspace file.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:21.160
<v Speaker 1>So it syncs across machines naturally by just doing get push, get pull.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.680
<v Speaker 1>And so, yeah, it's a little bit extra like that.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, I just want to give a shout out to the follow up to that, I suppose.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Like, yeah, that was awesome.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Still is.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Cool.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess I have, do you have more extras?

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.860
<v Speaker 1>No, without further extras.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I have one that I kind of forgot to say.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I am still working on the Lean TDD book,

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.100
<v Speaker 2>and I'm almost done with the building on test-driven development chapter.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.220
<v Speaker 2>So finally, with a book like TDD in the name,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.940
<v Speaker 2>I finally talked about TDD in it.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I haven't released that yet,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.920
<v Speaker 2>but I'm hoping to release that later today or maybe tomorrow.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh, very cool. Awesome. I love it.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.780
<v Speaker 1>That's great. I love the idea.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.800
<v Speaker 1>and Brutus out there says, Peacock is awesome.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I used it since last week when you talked about it, Brian.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.100
<v Speaker 2>Cool.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, I love it.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, I do too.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.300
<v Speaker 1>All right, let's do our joke.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.200
<v Speaker 1>So, you know, people have threats.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.240
<v Speaker 1>They can be empty threats or scary threats.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 1>You know, like I'm going to tell the world about this thing that you did weird

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.780
<v Speaker 1>or I'm going to fight you.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to punch you in the gut or whatever.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.640
<v Speaker 1>But that's not a very common thing that programmers do.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Programmers have a different version.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I will find you and I will install Linux on your computer.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, that's extreme.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, you know you've messed up when someone gets over and you're like,

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Fedora, all right, who did this?

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:58.800
<v Speaker 1>What is this?

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Reminds me of the, I'm having the BIOS flavor of the slushies.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 1>or the frozen yogurt or whatever.

00:24:10.379 --> 00:24:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, pretty good.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I will downvote your Hacker News article.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah, exactly.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I will definitely downvote your Hacker News article.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Or, you know, this also reminds me of

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.300
<v Speaker 1>some of the jokes people used to play.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh, my goodness.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Especially with Windows,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.220
<v Speaker 1>if you could change the background image.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 2>To the blue screen of death.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Like change the background image to the blue screen of death.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Or I know when Vista came out, people were super like,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.000
<v Speaker 1>do not put this on my computer.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.040
<v Speaker 1>And the IT people were installing it.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.140
<v Speaker 1>And I know someone who took a screenshot of Vista,

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.800
<v Speaker 1>put it onto someone else's computer,

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.820
<v Speaker 1>and then in-tasked their Explorer or something like that.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.080
<v Speaker 1>And so they didn't have any.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.500
<v Speaker 1>They had no thing overlaying it.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.320
<v Speaker 1>So it just like, no, they didn't.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:04.920
<v Speaker 1>And they're like, click on it.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Like, I told you it wouldn't work.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Nothing even clicks here.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I will find you and do stuff.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Your computer's pretty fun.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.400
<v Speaker 1>But this one is I will find you and install Linux in your computer.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:16.680
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Be careful whose child you abduct.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Well, I'll tell you what.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm not actually going to go install Linux on anyone's computers,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.280
<v Speaker 1>other than particularly mine.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.280
<v Speaker 1>So no threats here.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Although Henry does point out that these days,

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the opposite is more threatening.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll find you and I'll store Windows 11 on your computer.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh, there's a lot of bad ideas shown in the chat.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.040
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to share them.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.360
<v Speaker 1>No, they're great, though.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Made me laugh.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.240
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Thank you, everyone.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.140
<v Speaker 1>See you all later.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Bye.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Bye.
