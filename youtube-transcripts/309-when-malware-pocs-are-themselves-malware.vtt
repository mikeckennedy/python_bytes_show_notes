WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
Hey, everybody.


00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.640
Thanks for hanging out for a couple extra minutes.


00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.800
So we changed it to 11 o'clock for me, and I forgot.


00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.120
So anyway, thanks, Michael.


00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.120
No problem at all.


00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.400
I've got a lot of stuff to talk about.


00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.680
I had to take a chance to get it all ready, so it's fine.


00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.320
Yeah, it's exciting today.


00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.320
So yeah.


00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.920
Actually, let's get into it then, because we've got a lot to talk about.


00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.920
We do.


00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.720
We absolutely do.


00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.720
So Brian, I redesigned the Python Bytes website,


00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.560
which is kind of fun.


00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.000
It's got a lot of cool new features.


00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.920
Got some really nice responsive things and so on.


00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.720
- Should we do the intro or does it,


00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.720
do you wanna just?


00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.160
- We skipped it last time, now I'm broken.


00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.720
You're late and I'm broken.


00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.560
- Okay.


00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.400
- Yeah, let's go and do the intro


00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.240
and then I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll.


00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.080
- Okay.


00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.080
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes


00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.680
where we deliver news and headlines


00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.200
directly to your earbuds.


00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.120
This is episode 309.


00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.880
This is episode 309 recorded November 8th, election day.


00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.560
I am Brian Okken.


00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.860
- And I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.280
- Okay, now let's look at your thing.


00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.680
- Yes, well, Brian, doesn't my camera look good today?


00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.120
I got a new camera.


00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.640
Not that people matter who are listening.


00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.600
They don't care that much.


00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.800
They don't, or I gather it doesn't matter to me,


00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.360
but I got the new Elgato FaceCam Pro and I'm loving it.


00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.280
I can recommend it to people for sure.


00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.280
4K, 60 Hertz, awesome.


00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.440
But let's jump into the thing I was gonna tell you about.


00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.000
So first of all, redesign the Python Bytes website


00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.080
to make it like responsive.


00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.720
So even like the table gets like super cool


00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.560
when you just scroll up.


00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.600
But that's not what I wanna talk about.


00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.920
That's not why I brought it up.


00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.400
I mean, I always get these emails.


00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.240
I know you haven't logged into our site in five years,


00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.240
but we've redesigned it.


00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.080
Let's tell you about it.


00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.900
No, I don't care.


00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.320
The reason I'm on this page,


00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.080
what is the date today?


00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.920
November what?


00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.400
- It's the eighth.


00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.240
- It's the eighth.


00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.520
Yesterday was Python Bytes birthday.


00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.720
Six years old now.


00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.560
- Oh my gosh.


00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.680
I can't believe it's been six years.


00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.720
So, it's incredible. - Yeah, six years.


00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.960
The intro to the show in pip nine is out.


00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.880
What are we on, like pip 30?


00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.720
Something, I don't know.


00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.560
I haven't played it.


00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.080
- Well, they went from-- - It's past 20 for sure.


00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.600
- They went from a SemVer to CalVer,


00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.960
so you can't, it's hard to count.


00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.160
- It's still been a long time.


00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.280
- Yeah.


00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.560
- Absolutely.


00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.500
All right, well, anyway, happy birthday to us.


00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.160
Let's jump in. - Yay, we're gonna


00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.460
be able to break cake.


00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.660
- I know, cake.


00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.220
We have to use cake emojis somewhere today, I suppose.


00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.280
All right, so I wanna tell you about something


00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.280
that really touches on the cybersecurity, pen testing,


00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.660
you know, red team, blue team, sort of hacker side.


00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.420
And I don't know if people are aware,


00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.420
but Python is used a lot for the pen testing security side


00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.780
of the world.


00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.500
We've had some guests on the show here before


00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.740
that talked about their work, right?


00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.020
We're like, we don't understand this.


00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.340
You gotta come share this with people yourself.


00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.980
So it's awesome, but we're not worthy.


00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.300
But there's a really interesting set of research


00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.300
and this research came from Sofian Yadmani


00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.220
and Robin Thay and Olga Gagliataska.


00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.980
Sorry if I butchered everyone's name there.


00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.860
But it's as the title of the official academic articles


00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.420
is out of Norway, I think.


00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.500
How security professionals are being attacked,


00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.740
a study of malicious CVE proof of concept exploits


00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.580
in GitHub.


00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.620
Have you, have you run across this?


00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.640
- No, interesting.


00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.100
- It's, it sounds like it doesn't totally apply


00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.700
as maybe a Python programmer thing, but here's the deal.


00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.300
In order to, when these CVEs,


00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.060
these vulnerabilities come out and get announced,


00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.980
a lot of times people are like,


00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.180
"Oh my gosh, there's some problem."


00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.880
But like, what does it manifest like?


00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.740
If I'm going to write some code to explore it,


00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.040
to understand it, to do all the various things,


00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.580
how do I get started, right?


00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.820
A lot of these are super complicated.


00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.100
- Yeah. - And so what people will do


00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.420
is they'll post a simple proof of concept.


00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.280
Like imagine you've got a sandboxed web browser


00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.780
and it shouldn't be able to access,


00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.020
like for example, your processes


00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.780
and other parts of your file system.


00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.560
So if I went to a webpage, I could make it pop up,


00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.100
I don't know, notepad with the text,


00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.740
"Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, we got you."


00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.940
You know, something silly like that.


00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.940
You're like, "Oh my God, it opened notepad."


00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.040
Well, these people did some research


00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.040
and they found 47,000 posted proofs of concept.


00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.060
proofs of concept. And let's see somewhere. It's in the article, they talk about the actual


00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.720
language breakdown. Here you go. So when they said, what languages are these written in?


00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:08.940
HTML 300, Ruby 300, Go 400, C++ 1000, Python 8000. So that's a lot. So Python is by a factor


00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.460
of eight, the most common language that they are able to determine the language of the


00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.460
exploit.


00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.300
So it's something that really kind of applies to us.


00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.420
And of the, how many were there?


00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.180
There was like 47,000 of them.


00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.740
And out of those 4,800 or 10% were malicious, which sounds like, so what?


00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.100
It's a proof of concept of a malicious thing.


00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.360
No, it's like a meta malicious.


00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.360
So here's the deal.


00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.160
we will show you how you can break into Active Directory on this new exploit.


00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.960
What it really does is installs ransomware on your computer.


00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960
[LAUGHTER]


00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.960
So if you as a person are like,


00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.460
"I want to try this out and see if our system is vulnerable,"


00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.160
like instead of it doing what it said it would do,


00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.460
it just takes over your computer.


00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.860
And there's various ways in which it does it.


00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.360
It might contact like a known malicious...


00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.960
I know, there are some lulls in there to be sure, but...


00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.960
[LAUGHTER]


00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:14.360
But the idea is, it'll take your SSH keys and upload them to some malicious pastebin type place.


00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.960
Or it will install crypto miners, or it'll install ransomware, encryption types of things.


00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.360
And a few of them say, "You shouldn't have just run code off the internet. What are you doing?"


00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.760
And it'll like, rickroll you. But the majority of them take over for real.


00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.760
So isn't that nuts?


00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760
>> Yeah.


00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760
>> Yeah.


00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760
Yeah.


00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.760
So.


00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.760
>> Recurls are hilarious.


00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760
>> I know.


00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760
>> Just saying.


00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.760
>> They are.


00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.760
They are.


00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.040
Even in the paper, there's actually some Python proof of code.


00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.240
So here let me show you down here.


00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.600
Like pull this up.


00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.720
I don't know how to link to a code listing inside of a PDF.


00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.000
So I'm just going to cruise.


00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.520
Here we go.


00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.600
So for example, over here, so here it says, this is an example of one of these proof of


00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.780
concepts that shows you how things might work.


00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.120
And what is it going to do?


00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.280
It's going to go and say it's going to sleep for a second, get your host name, create a


00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.840
user thing, da da da da da.


00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:24.600
And then oddly, instead of saying the URL is a thing, the URL is a base64 decoded, encoded


00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.980
bunch of garbage, right?


00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.840
What is this?


00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.520
This is the malicious website that they're going to send your information to.


00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.720
But when you look at it, it doesn't look like here's the virus.


00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.720
It's like, oh, they're just decoding this text.


00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.720
I see.


00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.800
No, no, no, no.


00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.040
This is the virus right there.


00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.880
And there's way more complicated examples, but you know, pretty nuts.


00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.880
Yeah.


00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.040
Anyway, what's the formatting?


00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.800
If you're they should really run black on this.


00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.400
I know they totally they totally should.


00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.320
You deserve what you get if you're on that now.


00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.440
This is a pretty interesting thing.


00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.840
And if you're in the security space,


00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.040
if there's a 10% chance of just checking out


00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.880
one of these proof of concepts that you'll get owned,


00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.640
just be aware of it.


00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.720
You consider the audience of the people creating these.


00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.880
So I guess, much of hackers are like,


00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.000
"Hey, I made this code, you should try it."


00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.520
- No, but actually,


00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.720
we should have like a search thing or something like that.


00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.640
'Cause that base 64 decode thing is a classic,


00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.760
just don't touch it sort of thing.


00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.160
Especially if it's going into a URL or something,


00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.560
it's not good.


00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.920
- Yeah, they did come up with a way


00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.720
to automatically test for things.


00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.320
They said, look, if it's contacting a well-known,


00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.320
malicious command and control type IP address,


00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.940
which there's a listing, a database


00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.040
of these types of things.


00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.160
It's like, you know what?


00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.400
That's a problem.


00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.400
And here's a proof of concept


00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.360
that should have nothing to do with the internet


00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.560
and it's uploading data.


00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.080
that doesn't seem like it should, right?


00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.160
Or it's downloading this data from somewhere else.


00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.080
So, yeah.


00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.800
- Yeah.


00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.640
- Yeah, I like that Kim has got the,


00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.520
he's got the glass half full.


00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.320
A base 64 encoded URL is surely completely safe


00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.840
and nothing to worry about.


00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.600
And Marco is concerned about the SSH keys.


00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.080
Kind of fun.


00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.440
- Yeah.


00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.720
- And thanks for the happy birthday wishes


00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.920
out in the audience as well from everyone.


00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.080
- Yeah.


00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.080
Yeah, thanks people.


00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.180
- All right, Brian, that's all I got.


00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.380
But there's a really cool paper.


00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.700
There's some proof of concepts in there.


00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.200
There's a couple of write-ups on it.


00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.820
It's worth checking out.


00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.300
OK, cool.


00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.140
Well, I actually want to talk about something


00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.940
completely sort of different.


00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.900
So if you've-- let's just--


00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.140
I'll go to us for a second.


00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.700
Normally, I get a lot of my news from people on Twitter.


00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.820
But Twitter kind of is in the news lately,


00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.340
because things are kind of going weird with Twitter.


00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.580
So what are people doing?


00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.480
Well, a lot of people,


00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.300
a lot of people actually are checking out Mastodon.


00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.460
So I'm calling this the great Mastodon experiment


00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.700
because tons of us, Python people,


00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.940
and actually tons of tech people


00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.460
and tons of other people also


00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.140
are trying out this Mastodon thing.


00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.860
And in the back of our mind, it was,


00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.180
well, like, yeah, Mastodon seems kind of interesting.


00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.880
It's like a sort of maybe alternative to Twitter,


00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.760
but not many people there.


00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.400
Now there's a lot of people there, like tons of people.


00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.480
I don't know what the numbers are compared to Twitter,


00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.180
of course, but anyway, so I am part of this.


00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.460
I'm part of the people that have switched,


00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.960
but if you like here, we're showing the Mastodon,


00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.040
like join mastodon.org site.


00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.880
And the first thing you want to do, okay, I want to try this.


00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.120
So I have to, okay, I have to create an account.


00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.120
So you, the first thing you're hit is,


00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.240
well, which server do you want to use?


00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.720
I was stuck here for a while and I'm like,


00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.880
I don't know what to do.


00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.120
So I went ahead and I used Twitter and I asked,


00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.720
and Will was there from,


00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.760
Will said he's on mastodon.social, Will McGugan.


00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.240
And I just asked, I'm still stuck on the chooses server.


00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.740
What are people using?


00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.340
And I got one reply right away saying,


00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.520
well, fosstodon.org has Anthony Shaw


00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.160
and a bunch of other people.


00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.340
I'm like, good enough for me.


00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.240
So I went ahead and picked it.


00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.440
So I am now on Fosstodon also.


00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.800
And then I'm just trying stuff.


00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.080
I'm like just trying it out, playing it,


00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.720
playing with it, following some people,


00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.420
commenting, whatever.


00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.560
And so far I kind of like it.


00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.140
It's nice.


00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.920
Now that I've kind of like, I got the basics down,


00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.680
now I'm ready to learn some more.


00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.080
And so I put together,


00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.420
went through and found some tutorials.


00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.780
So if anybody else wants to try this also,


00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.940
I found some kind of fun tutorials.


00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.460
There's one that's called the


00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.260
increasingly less brief guide to mastodon.


00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.080
It's big, but it's, it's so it, that's nice though.


00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.780
It starts out with like, with like short answers,


00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.660
like, you know, what is it?


00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.820
How is it like Twitter?


00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.860
How is it not like Twitter?


00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.700
Stuff like that.


00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.580
And one of the things,


00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.580
comparisons that confused me a bit


00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.640
was how is it like email?


00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.020
But I didn't get the analogy at first,


00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.960
but I kind of do now.


00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.300
So the idea is you have to pick a server,


00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.160
but you can still follow people on other servers.


00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.880
Just like if you have a Gmail account,


00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.760
you can still email people that are not in Gmail.


00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.240
Works.


00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.400
So there's that.


00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.040
There's everything I know about Mastodon.


00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.680
- It reminds me a little bit of like BBSs.


00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.720
Remember like you could go to BBS and write email


00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.560
and then they would like sync at night


00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.000
and then you might get email from some other BDS.


00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.200
- Well, yeah, that's something I also noticed


00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.840
that at first I was a little annoyed


00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.220
because like it's not as zippy sometimes.


00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.120
Like it's growing a lot.


00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.100
So a lot of these servers are like adding capacity.


00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.120
And so occasionally, like the other day,


00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.560
the Fosstodon server was down for a couple hours


00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.060
and I'm like, oh my God, actually I'll be fine


00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.900
if I don't use a social media app for two hours, just chill.


00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.900
And so, yeah, it's interesting.


00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.540
There's a lot of stuff I've learned so far.


00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.520
Like it's not filtering what I'm seeing.


00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.700
I actually just see everything that people write


00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.020
that I'm following.


00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.820
Actually, isn't that what I wanted?


00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.100
So I'm pretty okay with it.


00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.800
So I put together, I'll go through a couple of these.


00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.820
There's everything I know.


00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.140
It's targeted towards data science people,


00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.040
but there's a lot of great info there.


00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.860
There's a, and then Simon Willison,


00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.800
he's trying this out too, said,


00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.060
Mastodon is just blogs.


00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.440
So I was confused by that,


00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.820
but he describes how it's like,


00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.340
it uses this active pub feature


00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.180
and gets into a little details.


00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.620
But I think he knows what he's talking about


00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.340
because he wrote his own, he's on his own server.


00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.740
So you can have your own,


00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.540
you can have your own Mastodon server if you want.


00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.940
but some of the people trying it out at the same time,


00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.460
we've got some big names, Lucas Lange, he's trying it out.


00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.980
He linked to a couple of things like that he's learning


00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.540
about, you know, it's really supposed to repost


00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.380
in multiple places, things like that.


00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.460
I've got Brett Cannon figuring it out.


00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.300
So a lot of us over here having a little bit of fun


00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.140
with Mastodon.


00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.500
So. - That's fantastic.


00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.260
Yeah, so fosstodon.org is the free


00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.180
and open source software, Mastodon one, right?


00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.300
- Yeah.


00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.620
But a lot of people are on,


00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.640
so like a lot of people are on mastodon.social.


00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.060
Here's a cool article.


00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.900
Oh yeah.


00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:59.180
Clients wise, there's a whole bunch of iPhone clients too,


00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.820
but you can use it on the web or anything.


00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.060
Lucas is on, or Lokesh, I'm sorry,


00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.940
is on mastodon.social also.


00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.540
Brett's on Fosstodon, but there's a whole bunch of others as well.


00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.260
So.


00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.460
>> Yeah.


00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.980
You have to apply to get in there.


00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.420
So I applied, but I have not been let in yet.


00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.060
So hopefully they will find me worthy and I can join you.


00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.460
>> [LAUGH] Okay.


00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.580
>> I'll have to see.


00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.580
>> Well, I know some of them, so some of them are, since these are private things,


00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.140
there's got people running their own servers.


00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:37.380
There's funding models on each of them.


00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.760
And like Fossadon, for instance, said,


00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.860
they wanna make sure that they always have six months


00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.820
of running time or something like that.


00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.940
And that's cool enough for me.


00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.780
So anyway.


00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:52.100
- Yeah, I'd be happy to pay a dollar or two a month


00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.420
just to have no ads and have a well curated,


00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.020
somewhat not terrible space.


00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.260
- You know, yeah, I wasn't really getting to get


00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.620
into the politics of it, but the whole $8 a month thing,


00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.580
actually, if I could have got rid of ads


00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.980
and actually got some other cool features.


00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.900
I probably would have paid it anyway.


00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.620
I just don't want to pay it now.


00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.780
I'd be like two months ago,


00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.140
I probably would have been up for it,


00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.100
but I don't want to do that right now.


00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.980
- Yeah, I have no intention of leaving Twitter at the moment.


00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.620
There's still like a really valuable community


00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.180
for the podcast listeners and stuff.


00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.880
But I do think it's also super interesting


00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.060
to reach out to these other spaces.


00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.260
Mastodon is one, it's kind of interesting in that


00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.140
there's a bunch of little islands.


00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.260
And the thing that's cool about Twitter is you go to the continent and then you find


00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.660
your space within that.


00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.380
It's like here you got to, what is the place I go to?


00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.700
I'm telling you, this is like BBSs.


00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:54.500
What BBS has the place where there's cool conversations and good games I can play?


00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.860
You dial that one up.


00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:01.820
Or we could just go back to Planet Python and RSS feeds for everybody.


00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.820
Yeah.


00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.660
Nothing wrong with RSS.


00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.660
Cool.


00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:11.540
I have some more thoughts on this as well later, but for now.


00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.220
For now, maybe we could talk about our sponsor.


00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.620
What do you think?


00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:21.300
We should talk about our sponsor because it's cool that we have one, but also it's Microsoft.


00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:27.160
So this episode of Python Bytes is brought to you by Microsoft for startups.


00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.860
But starting a business is hard.


00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.260
Most startups go out of business within the first year, which is totally lame.


00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:40.220
So Microsoft for Startups set out to understand what startups need to be successful and created


00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.580
a digital platform to help you overcome those challenges.


00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.820
And they came up with Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub.


00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:52.500
The Founders Hub provides all founders at any stage with free resources to help solve


00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.660
startup challenges.


00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:59.180
The platform provides technology benefits, access to expert guidance and skilled resources,


00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.460
mentorship and network connections, and so much more.


00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.620
Like others in the industry, Microsoft for Startup, Founders Hub doesn't require startups


00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.780
to be investor backed or third party validated to participate.


00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.360
Founders Hub is truly open to all.


00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:22.380
You can speed up development with free access to GitHub and Microsoft Cloud.


00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:28.340
And there's other partners that they partners with such as OpenAI, you can get discounts


00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.460
through there.


00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.620
So you'll have access to those extra resources,


00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.720
but you also get access to their mentorship network,


00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.620
which includes hundreds of mentors


00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.220
across a range of disciplines.


00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.340
Need advice on marketing, fundraising,


00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.060
idea validation maybe.


00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.100
Tons of topics that you might need help on,


00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.580
including management and coaching,


00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.920
and you'll be able to book a one-on-one meeting


00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.700
with mentors, many of whom were former founders themselves.


00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.820
It's no longer about who you know.


00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.460
get critical support you need from Microsoft


00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.580
for Startups Founders Hub.


00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.160
Make your idea a reality today.


00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.160

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.600
And I know you can find this on your own by Googling,


00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.140
but using that link in the show notes will help them


00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.640
know that you found it through this podcast.


00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.480
Thanks.


00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.880
Oh, you're on mute.


00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:32.680
I am. Thank you, Microsoft. And yeah, let's let's move on. A couple of these things are


00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:40.400
about continued journeys. Sometimes we're on a journey, you know? Yeah. And switch it


00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:47.320
over theory over on Twitter, not mastered on yet. Sent me sent us a message and said,


00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.080
Hey, nice episode.


00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.600
You know, remember I was on this,


00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.400
I talked about like Panix, SSH,


00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.160
thing called prompt and some of the other ways


00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.200
I was trying to like, well, how do I just take my iPad


00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.020
and no keyboards and no extra stuff


00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.360
and just have a little devopsy coding


00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.960
type of environment, right? - Oh yeah.


00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.120
- So theory says you should check out Gitpod.


00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.040
Have you heard of Gitpod?


00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.400
- No.


00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.080
No, pod as in pods from Kubernetes.


00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.520
But here, he says,


00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.040
yeah, basically I should pull up and show you what it is.


00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.800
So if you go over here, the idea is,


00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.640
it says, always ready to code.


00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.720
Like that sounds cool, right?


00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.300
And I love, look at this little graphic, right?


00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.280
Okay, you're like, your chair is an enter button.


00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.280
I love it.


00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.960
- Oh, I didn't notice that right at first.


00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.160
That's cool.


00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.800
- Yeah, and by the way, they just,


00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.120
this happened I think since this got sent over,


00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.840
they just raved a $25 million Series A round.


00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.640
So there's a lot of effort behind this, right?


00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.280
Gitpod is, I believe there's an open source version


00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.760
and then like a hosted version as well.


00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.760
So the idea is, what you can do is I can go


00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:09.040
and it'll create a Kubernetes Docker type image


00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.940
that I can configure.


00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.060
So basically a Linux machine that's isolated for me,


00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.420
which is nice.


00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.220
And then I can log into it one of two ways.


00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.920
I can log into it in the browser.


00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.100
And just like if you go to github.dev,


00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.420
which is what I suggested before,


00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.020
in the browser, this connects to your own environment,


00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.740
which the thing that's cool about this


00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.340
is it's that environment,


00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.700
you have a root access to do whatever you want to it.


00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.220
So if you got a pip install something that's weird


00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.060
or whatever, like you're not like,


00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.900
"Oh, well, sorry, you can't install this dependency."


00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.060
Too bad, right?


00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:44.900
It's just, it's yours.


00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.500
You do whatever you want with it.


00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.380
And that's in the browser.


00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.060
So on your iPad browser, for example,


00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.700
or if you happen to be on the desktop


00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.700
and what you want is just like a,


00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.980
I'm on an ARM machine, I want an x86 machine,


00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.540
or I want a Linux machine that's like production


00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.760
and that is not just my Mac or my Windows machine.


00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.340
You can actually connect to it with a full on VS Code


00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.340
or even PyCharm, you can plug directly into it


00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.660
and remotely edit locally on PyCharm locally,


00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.020
but then debug and run your environment there.


00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:17.380
>> Wow.


00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.100
>> How cool is that?


00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.340
>> That's really cool.


00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.260
>> Yeah, it also works for IntelliJ,


00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:27.840
the Go, basically all the VS Code and all the JetBrains IDEs,


00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.080
which is a huge long list,


00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.220
and Vim, and also Vimit.


00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.460
>> Wow.


00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.060
>> Anyway, this is really cool.


00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.580
One of the recommendations or like reasons for it,


00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.740
it says, look, you can do multi-track development.


00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.140
So if I'm doing like, I'm working on a feature branch


00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.260
and I'm working on main dev


00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.060
and I'm trying to do a bug fix,


00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.060
instead of staging or stashing and then checking out


00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.780
and then try that and then check over the other thing,


00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.300
like juggling one working environment,


00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.020
you could have multiples of these Git pods,


00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.820
one for each part of your project even,


00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.560
bring it closer to your Linux and Docker runtime.


00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.740
You can even do like paired programming on it,


00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.900
which is kind of interesting.


00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.900
And here they got an example of it running on an iPad.


00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.380
And apparently you can install


00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.260
like a bunch of different extensions and stuff


00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.700
and like, you know, configure up your thing.


00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.520
So there's an open source version,


00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.600
which is free from big tech influence.


00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:40.220
but there's also, you can get their version on the cloud


00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.380
or you can self host it or whatever, right?


00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.780
And so there is a paid component to this,


00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.100
like this, you know, they got $25 million, right?


00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.600
It's not just like to set on fire, although maybe.


00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.620
There's a free version,


00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.780
which gives you 50 hours of coding a month.


00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.600
That's pretty good.


00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.240
Or you can pay $9 a month for 100 hours,


00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.240
or there's like other higher tiers, 25, 40 bucks and stuff.


00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.460
but it's open source and there's some free versions


00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.860
and reasonably priced versions.


00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.820
And yeah, I don't know, I think it's pretty cool.


00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.580
So thanks Theory for sending it over.


00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.900
And you know, it's definitely an option out there.


00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.300
- Yeah, and the self-hosted also is,


00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.180
looks like an option as well.


00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.020
- Yeah, exactly.


00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:23.840
So you can self-host.


00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.340
I think you basically probably set up a Kubernetes cluster


00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.580
and like it connects and goes against that.


00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.980
- Oh yeah, just throw up a Kubernetes cluster.


00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.740
- Yeah, exactly.


00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.580
Cool, all right.


00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.260
Well, I haven't, I did play around with it


00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.440
and it worked pretty well,


00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.240
but I haven't done anything serious.


00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.980
- It still looks cool though.


00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.920
I like it. - Yeah, absolutely.


00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.780
All right, what's your last one here?


00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.540
- Oh, last one is a short one.


00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.820
I just wanted to talk about terminal colors.


00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.260
So I've got this little,


00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.060
a little pytest plugin called pytest-check,


00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.700
and it's got some terminal output,


00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.340
but it does talk about failures and somebody completely reasonably


00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:11.900
submitted an issue and said, it'd be cool if these were red.


00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.380
So you could see them easier. And I'm like, yeah, that would be cool.


00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.500
So what should I do? Well, I could you know,


00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.780
well I want to let you know that I,


00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.420
the first thing I thought about was I could throw a rich at it.


00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.900
So I can, I can use rich to do, to put red in the terminal.


00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.920
And, but Rich is now Rich is awesome.


00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.220
I love Rich, but maybe it's a bit of a big hammer


00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.140
for just having one color, just adding red.


00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.060
So I went looking around a little bit


00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.020
and there's term color and there's Colorama.


00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.960
There's other things I ended up,


00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.820
I'm looking at Colorama right now


00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.940
is what I'm playing with.


00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.780
So Colorama is used by a lot of applications.


00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.820
And one of the reasons why is


00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.380
because it helps with the cross,


00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.380
being able to use colors on both Windows and everything else.


00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.900
Windows is a little special.


00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.280
It doesn't act like the other stuff.


00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.800
So you have to do things a bit special.


00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.060
And I was kind of glad I looked at this


00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.100
because one of the things that came up recently


00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.620
in one of the new versions is Colorama has a thing


00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.380
called Just Fix Windows Console.


00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.060
It's just a from Colorama import, just fix Windows console.


00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.220
And you call that.


00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.860
And after you call that, then your window,


00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.660
if you run your application on Windows,


00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.940
it acts just like a normal TTY terminal


00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.060
on Linux or Mac or something.


00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:41.900
- Oh wow.


00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.680
- At least in terms of a lot of stuff.


00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.400
The other thing that just fix Windows console,


00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.980
I think I got this right, is it's,


00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.120
you used to have to call init,


00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.980
and now you call this other thing,


00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.400
but you can call that on Mac also


00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.120
and it just doesn't hurt anything, it's fine.


00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.940
So you can, and now after you've done that,


00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.700
and there's a whole bunch of text here


00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.820
that I just skimmed really briefly.


00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.580
I just wanted it to work.


00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.180
Just call that and then you can use these color codes


00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.580
like for.red, for instance, that's what I wanted,


00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.900
just some red text, and there I've got it.


00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.980
So after you change stuff around,


00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.620
you also have to reset it, so there's a reset code.


00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.900
Now you can do the same thing,


00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.900
and it has it on their readme,


00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.900
is you can use the hex or whatever color code


00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.700
escape sequences.


00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.700
So backslash 033 bracket 31 M is red,


00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:45.060
but I think I'll go with the names ones.


00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.860
- How about some constants instead?


00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.440
- Yeah, so this is pretty cool.


00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.960
And I think, I kind of think this is where I'm gonna go


00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.360
with adding red to put Pytest check.


00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.880
So if you want just a little bit of color


00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.820
and nothing that you need rich for,


00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.620
Colorama might be what you want, so.


00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.240
- Nice, Colorama is definitely a go-to for me


00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.480
when I just want like, this needs to be red or green.


00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.920
It just needs to stand out somehow, for sure.


00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920
It's very cool.


00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.520
- Yeah.


00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.360
Cool.


00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.180
- Awesome.


00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.000
All right, well, that brings us to our extras, huh?


00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.640
- Yeah, do you got any extras?


00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.320
- You know I do.


00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.160
Let's see.


00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.660
Some of these are quick, some are slightly more.


00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:33.520
So Roman Wright, who often we find here


00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.080
in the live streams as well, maker of Beanie, love Beanie.


00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.840
Beanie is powering pythonbytes.fm, by the way,


00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.160
for various other things, so super awesome.


00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.640
He'd been thinking, and so Beanie is


00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:52.000
Pydantic plus MongoDB async.


00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.020
And he said, there's plenty of reasons


00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.820
why we might want asynchronous API.


00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.520
I'm just in the middle of some script


00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.320
and I just need to talk to the database real quick.


00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.960
Like, do I really need to upgrade this whole thing


00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.600
to handle async code?


00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.020
Shouldn't there just be a way to call it?


00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.060
There should.


00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:10.060
And so he created a derivative or mirrored version


00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:14.960
that is like Beanie, but has a synchronous set of APIs


00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.040
instead of asynchronous.


00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.600
API is called Bunnet, which I don't know the word Bunnet,


00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.800
but I think it has something to do with,


00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:28.000
like something to do with a bean, I'm not sure.


00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.360
But anyway, Bunnet, it's similar to Beanie,


00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.480
except for you just don't await things, right?


00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.000
You just use the PyMongo base instead of the motor client


00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.560
under the hood, and then you just, you know, do,


00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:44.920
thing insert or thing.find one or whatever.


00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.160
So people can check that out if they're into Beanie,


00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.120
but they don't want the async version.


00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.460
- Hmm.


00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.160
- Yeah, it's brand new.


00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.160
- I just looked it up, a bunnet is a,


00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.680
it's a type of hat.


00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.840
It's like a Scottish hat thing.


00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.840
- Okay, well, that would explain the icon here.


00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.920
Maybe it looks like a bean, but it's actually a hat.


00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.360
Oh, Roman's here, hey Roman.


00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.960
So this is a Scottish word, fabulous.


00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.720
And Wilma Guggen is a bun is a hat worn by old Scottish men.


00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.560
Lovely.


00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.520
- Cool.


00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.360
- Awesome.


00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.880
And congrats, Roman, on getting that out there.


00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.720
That's awesome.


00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.000
PyCon, you brought up PyCon 2023 last week.


00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.840
- Yeah.


00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.680
- They've got this cool like tile sort of celebration


00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.560
of history on their website.


00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.320
And they tell you that it will be April 19 to 27.


00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.080
There's a small problem with that though.


00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:50.640
how actionable is it if I want to go to the conference and I want to go see the main talks,


00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.320
when do I book my travel?


00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.320
The whole thing.


00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.880
I mean, the whole thing is awesome.


00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.960
I can come to the tutorials and do the week of sprints after.


00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.960
I don't know.


00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.960
That's a lot.


00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:09.720
And so I reached out to Twitter and Marietta says, tutorials are on Wednesdays and Thursdays.


00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.440
Talks, keynotes, expo halls are Friday to Sunday.


00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.640
And from Monday onwards, those are the spreads.


00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.760
Perfect, perfect.


00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.120
So yesterday while I was sitting,


00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.480
getting studded winter tires put on my car


00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.980
so I can go to the mountains and not die,


00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.160
I decided to go ahead and book my travel


00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.200
and I'm gonna go to the conference.


00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.720
We talked about maybe we'll go, maybe not.


00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.300
I'm gonna go for a whole week.


00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.600
I'm gonna show up on Thursday and leave on the next Thursday


00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.680
maybe be part of the spreads,


00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.320
but definitely do a ton of podcasting while I'm there


00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.200
I try to just make it like a,


00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.500
other people will be spreading out code.


00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.600
I'm going to be sprinting on podcast episodes.


00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.560
- I got to decide what I'm going to do.


00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.640
I haven't decided yet.


00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.880
I'll probably go.


00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.440
- Flights are still pretty cheap right now.


00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.120
They might be like hotels and stuff.


00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.200
I think there are really a lot of variations.


00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.400
Like there was, I was like,


00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.760
oh, maybe I'll stay at the Hilton $3,300.


00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.920
Like, yeah, maybe I won't stay at the Hilton.


00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.400
What else?


00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.740
So I think people are starting to book it out.


00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.360
- Okay.


00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.540
Anyway, thank you Marietta for sharing that information.


00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.580
It makes it much easier for us to plan about participating


00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.420
or even just watching PyCon online.


00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.580
- Yeah. - Cool.


00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.420
- Yeah.


00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.240
All right.


00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.100
Quick shout outs to GeForce Now.


00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.620
Have you heard of GeForce Now?


00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.460
- No.


00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.180
- So my daughter's really into gaming these days.


00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.580
She plays a bunch of like horse riding games


00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:39.700
and Minecraft and Planet Zoo.


00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.660
And there's a cool Jurassic Park thing


00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.660
that's like a Sims but for dinosaurs.


00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.140
And most of these games run on Windows.


00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.460
And we have an Alienware computer,


00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.380
but it's all set up for my Sim racing.


00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.860
So it's kind of hard to play games


00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.300
that don't involve a steering wheel.


00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.580
And she's like, how can I play these games on my PC?


00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.820
I'm like, oh-- or my Mac, right?


00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.260
She has a MacBook Air.


00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.220
like, I don't know. She's like, how could I play if I'm not at


00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:10.060
home and I can stream. So we try out GeForce now basically it


00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:13.300
will, they'll give you a high end Windows computer and like a


00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:18.500
GeForce 3080. And they just streams like Netflix to your to


00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.580
your PC. And it is super low latency. I mean, it's like,


00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.180
you're really just playing it there. But you're not it's it's


00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:25.900
pretty awesome.


00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.780
Oh, so you're playing it's you can play a game on a remote


00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.460
computer then.


00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.180
Yeah, or I mean, you can play it on your iPad,


00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.140
or you can play it on your iPhone, or Android,


00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.660
or on your Mac, or whatever.


00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.740
And they've got a completely 100% free tier.


00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.740
So it's pretty nuts.


00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.940
People should check that out.


00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:47.940
Anyway, that was a cool techno experience.


00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.820
Two new YouTube videos I've released.


00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.500
One five days ago, one five hours ago.


00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.140
How about that for timing?


00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.820
Nice.


00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:00.820
So as part of this sort of social media, Twitter madness


00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.160
and various other things,


00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.220
I've been thinking about this for a while.


00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.460
Anyway, I'm like, all right,


00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:09.060
I really want to try to build up my presence on other areas


00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.980
and that are not just Twitter.


00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.140
And so like, well, YouTube might be one fun place


00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.420
to sort of build up a community.


00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.140
So I'm starting to add more videos there, right?


00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.060
So like I've done in the past couple of weeks,


00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.020
I've done four videos,


00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:24.560
but the last two is a walrus meets a Python, which is fun.


00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.600
That's about the walrus operator.


00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.120
And then the one that came out today is Python GC settings,


00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.720
which shows some insane stuff you can do


00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.920
to tweak the GC a little bit


00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.320
and get crazy better performance.


00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.240
- Nice, the GC being the garbage collector, right?


00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.560
- Yes, not reference counting,


00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.160
which does like 99.9% of Python memory.


00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.960
The 0.1% or the 0.1%, whatever's left over.


00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.060
Like that actually, you often can turn that down


00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.940
'cause you don't really have cycles that much


00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:59.540
that get lost and it turns out to have some pretty interesting effects. We've talked,


00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:05.940
we think we covered, was, was it Instagram? I think, I think they wrote an article called


00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:10.340
dismissing the garbage collector where they literally turned it off in production. It


00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.340
was either that or, core, I can't remember which one, which company did it, but this


00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.420
is kind of like a, well, let's don't be so aggressive like that, but kind of, you know,


00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.620
And it's pretty neat.


00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.460
- Nice.


00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.660
- People can check those out.


00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:27.340
- Yeah, so one of the things that I,


00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:31.260
the only extra I've got is I really liked this article


00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.720
from Simon and Wilson about what to blog about.


00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.060
So a lot of, so people are trying to have a presence


00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.700
somewhere other than Twitter, like,


00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.560
and maybe write, start writing your blog more.


00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:46.180
And I like this, what to blog about.


00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.800
He goes through a couple of things.


00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.140
One of the things is the today I learned.


00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.180
And I, you know, I actually, at first,


00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.740
when I first encountered the TIL thing,


00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.260
I first was like, why not?


00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.380
Why do you need that?


00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.040
Can't you just like, just write what you learned anyway?


00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.660
But a lot of people have this paralysis of,


00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.180
if I write how to do something,


00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.780
people are gonna think it's a tutorial


00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.660
and I don't know how to do everything with this tool.


00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.620
I just learned this little thing of how to do,


00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.680
fix my thing.


00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.680
So the TIL at least is a tag that people will know


00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.360
though it's not a full tutorial.


00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.320
It's just a little snippet of somebody


00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.240
learned about this thing.


00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.360
And I think this is a great way to go about writing it.


00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.760
It can be short and simple, or it can be longer.


00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.960
Plus, also, if you build up a lot of these around a topic,


00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.800
it might turn into a tutorial later.


00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.480
So now that you've learned a ton,


00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.280
you can write a longer blog post about it.


00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.600
I also just want to tell people that it doesn't have


00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.320
to be like a full tutorial.


00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.160
You don't have to compete with real Python or other places.


00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.000
You can just do a short thing you learned about.


00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.360
It doesn't have to be this.


00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.760
Okay, the other thing he talked about was projects,


00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.440
is to write about projects that you've done.


00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.360
And I think that's a great idea.


00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:07.300
And, but I also want to make sure that people understand


00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.120
also the things you're working on, right?


00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.720
Right, as you're building stuff,


00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.760
this can be part of the TIL, but it could just be,


00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.680
this is the fate.


00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.620
And it's also another way to limit the scope


00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.800
like a color in the terminal.


00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.240
I don't wanna write about all of color in the terminal,


00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.060
but maybe I could write about the,


00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.720
just fixing this one bug or this one feature request,


00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.760
what I went through to figure out how to use Colorama


00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.520
and then how do I detect whether it's a TTY terminal


00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.280
or not, things like that.


00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.120
That can be a decent article just to write about that.


00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.580
And so I think these are great tips


00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.860
for unblocking yourself.


00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.160
The other thing I wanna tell people about is,


00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.100
if you've covered it,


00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.300
you've learned it from somebody else's blog already,


00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.300
but it didn't quite meet your needs


00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.000
and you looked at other places,


00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.100
that means that there is a tutorial out there that's missing


00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.540
and it's the one that kind of fits your brain.


00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.220
You can rewrite something that is similar


00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.140
to what other people have written about


00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.980
and just write it in a different way that fits you better.


00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.080
And that'll maybe fit other people better too.


00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.120
So there's nothing wrong with that.


00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.040
It doesn't have to be completely unique.


00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.480
So. - Yeah, absolutely.


00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.000
Definitely doesn't.


00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.320
I like it. - That's all I got.


00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.160
- Came out there.


00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.480
Yeah, it came out there says,


00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.280
TILs are also handy to reread from time to time


00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.440
and remind yourself of things


00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.000
you've figured out and forgotten.


00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.480
Yeah, like you can see the search engines


00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.760
with stuff that you knew.


00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.800
And then when you forget it, you can find it again.


00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.400
- And you know, that's how I started blogging


00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.120
and I didn't call it TIL.


00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.080
I would just, I had a blog nobody was reading


00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.440
and I would just throw up stuff like


00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.800
commands that I looked up, like commands from a tool.


00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.920
Like, I always forget how to change my commit message


00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.160
after I've committed too fast.


00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.760
So throwing up a little post about


00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.040
git commit amend would be fine.


00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:01.880
- Yep.


00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.700
- So anyway.


00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.840
- Yep, absolutely.


00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.520
All right, well, this has been a fun episode


00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.520
but it's still good sometimes to just


00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.600
take a moment and relax, right?


00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600
- Yeah.


00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.880
I mean, some people, I took my dog for a walk in the woods during sunrise, it was like this


00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.760
fog.


00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.520
Some people getting out in nature is amazing.


00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:23.960
But as software developers, a lot of times you want to get kind of close to the code


00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.440
or like close to the heart of technology.


00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.360
And what speaks heart of technology more than the server?


00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.160
This is crazy, man.


00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.880
So here's a thing you can play.


00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.880
It's on YouTube.


00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.880
I'll show you in a second.


00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:44.680
And it says pure relaxation server sound so we can come over here and it actually has tracks


00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.220
So like it starts with desktop in the drill drum


00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.680
Entering the engine in the engine room the far side of the cloud


00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:56.860
I find co-location ventilation to be especially relaxing


00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.800
facing facing the cloud


00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.260
And finally spacewalk, so I just want to play a little bit of this for people rain


00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.800
Okay, I think I think they're gonna enjoy it


00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.640
maybe


00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:19.960
Hopefully you all can hear it out there.


00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.200
So here, let's see, we'll skip around a little.


00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.080
If we go.


00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:31.040
It's amazing, right?


00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.080
So relaxing.


00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.240
So anyway, I'm hoping that other people can hear.


00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.360
Yeah, it's so not come out.


00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.760
You guys will have to check it out.


00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.760
I'll put the audio in the actual recorded version,


00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.680
but I can't get it to go out the live stream.


00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.640
I don't know why, 'cause I,


00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.320
I uploaded them on the sound, anyway.


00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.360
- You shared it with me before we started though,


00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.520
and I gotta say, it's hilarious.


00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.880
So I'm gonna go check this out.


00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.480
- I mean, keep in mind, a lot of people have to wear


00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.720
like big earmuffs sound protection to go in these rooms.


00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.760
So it might be the opposite of relaxing,


00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.220
but you'll see, you'll see.


00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.640
- Okay, cool, nice find.


00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.560
- All right, yeah, thanks.


00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.960
- It's just here to help people be more productive.


00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.020
- Yeah.


00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.900
- Maybe not with this though.


00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.260
- Well, and some of these people that used to be around


00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.260
all these server farms are now working from home


00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.740
and they might miss that sound.


00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.280
- That's true. - Good.


00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.060
- Roman out there points out that the scary part


00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.060
is actually if the server room is quiet.


00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.300
(laughing)


00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.980
Why is it quiet?


00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:30.820
This is not good.


00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.500
All right.


00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.320
- All right.


00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.780
Well, thanks a lot for as always


00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.540
And thank everybody for watching and showing up


00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.740
and listening.


00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.740
We love you.


00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.580
And we'll talk to everyone.


00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.400
- Thanks everyone.


00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.500
It's been an awesome six years and we'll keep going.


00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.980
- Yeah, bye.


00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.820
- Bye.
