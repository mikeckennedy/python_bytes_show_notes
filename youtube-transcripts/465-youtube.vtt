00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:02.500
<v Brian Okken>Hey, everyone. Hey, Michael.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Hey, hey.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.100
<v Brian Okken>It's still January.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Brian Okken>We're still going through it.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, I am excited to have another episode of Python Bytes today,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Brian Okken>and we've got some fun stuff in line for everybody.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Brian Okken>So let's jump in.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Brian Okken>Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes,

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Brian Okken>where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.300
<v Brian Okken>This is episode 465, recorded January 12th, 2026.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Brian Okken>And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Brian Okken>And I am Michael Kennedy.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.980
<v Brian Okken>And this episode is sponsored by us and you.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.360
<v Brian Okken>So thanks to everybody that does support us through Patreon supporters

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Brian Okken>and also through grabbing the pytest course or the Lean TDD book

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.740
<v Brian Okken>or so many of the massively cool courses at Talk Python Training

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.060
<v Brian Okken>and also Michael's fun book on deployment and stuff like that.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Brian Okken>So if you'd like to, we're recording this for the podcast,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Brian Okken>but also broadcasting it live.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Brian Okken>If you'd like to join the live, you can join us at YouTube,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Brian Okken>but you can just go to pythonbytes.fm/live,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Brian Okken>and there's a link on how to get that and what the timing is and all that.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Brian Okken>Also, you don't need to take notes.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Brian Okken>You can just sign up for our newsletters.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Brian Okken>So go to pythonbytes.fm, grab the newsletter,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Brian Okken>and we don't do very many spammy things.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Brian Okken>We just let you know what we talked about

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.700
<v Brian Okken>and with all the links and a little bit of extra information.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, and we love growing that list.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Brian Okken>It grows by a little bit every week,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Brian Okken>and it's so fun to see.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Brian Okken>And with that, Michael, what do you got for us first?

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Michael Kennedy>- Let's talk about Portkiller.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Portkiller.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Michael Kennedy>So Portkiller is an interesting Mac app.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Michael Kennedy>And if you're not a Mac, I apologize.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Michael Kennedy>I know it's a Windows as well.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.979
<v Michael Kennedy>It's a Windows as well.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you're a Mac or Windows, which is a good chunk of us,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Michael Kennedy>here is a cool application.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Michael Kennedy>So let me just lay out the problem for you, Brian.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Either you've got 20 terminal tabs open, or in one of your four IDE windows,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Michael Kennedy>you've got your API running, or you've got your web app running, or something like that.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Michael Kennedy>And you go try to run it again, not knowing that fact, and it says,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.080
<v Michael Kennedy>sorry, that port is already in use.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Michael Kennedy>You're like, oh, man, where is it now?

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Michael Kennedy>And that's on you to know where you ran it.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, I mean, there's a button to say run in your IDE versus running the terminal.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.200
<v Michael Kennedy>And so maybe just press the button.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Michael Kennedy>You forgot, oh, yeah, that thing was like one of the running things.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.700
<v Michael Kennedy>But since 2025, there's another reason this is a pain is some of these agentic AI things.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.500
<v Michael Kennedy>They're like, oh, let me start the server for you so I can test it.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Michael Kennedy>And it'll temporarily fire up the web server, make a request, and lose track of it, and not kill it.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.840
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's not in your terminal. It's not in your IDE. It's just there somewhere in the background, hidden.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.580
<v Michael Kennedy>You can't get to it to shut it down.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.740
<v Michael Kennedy>You go to Task Manager Activity Monitor, and you say Python is like four things.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Michael Kennedy>You're like, hmm, well, three of those are supposed to be running. Which one do I kill?

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.100
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's just a real hassle.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.240
<v Michael Kennedy>And so this port killer solves that problem, not just for Python, but for applications in general, right?

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.320
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's a powerful cross-platform port management tool for developers.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.240
<v Michael Kennedy>It monitors ports, manages Kubernetes port forwarding, and even does integrated Cloudflare tunnels.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's really, really slick, actually.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.840
<v Michael Kennedy>So what you do is it's got a little notification section menu bar thing that drops down.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And you can have multiple CloudFlare tunnels, which we've talked about in Grok and I've talked about Rathole.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Like CloudFlare tunnels are a thing like that.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Like put this on the internet so other people can get to it.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.600
<v Michael Kennedy>So maybe I can help debug or show off something, right?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Like if you're trying to debug a webhook, the only way to do that is online, right?

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Because some other server is trying to get to your dev machine.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So these tunnels are super helpful.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.180
<v Michael Kennedy>We talked about that.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.060
<v Michael Kennedy>So that will actually manage these things.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, for example, you can go to, say, your Flask app.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Michael Kennedy>And I'm pretty sure you can, I don't see it in the UI exactly,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.260
<v Michael Kennedy>but I think you can go to it and say,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Michael Kennedy>oh, expose this Flask application as a Cloudflare tunnel.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Boom.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.680
<v Michael Kennedy>It's off to the races.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.400
<v Michael Kennedy>That's pretty cool.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Michael Kennedy>But it also shows you all the local ports that are open.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And you can go kill them.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Michael Kennedy>So what you can do is you can actually go to either search for a process or a port.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.820
<v Michael Kennedy>You're like, it says that port, you know, 5,000 or 8,000.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's go with 8,000.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.140
<v Michael Kennedy>It's a little safer.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Michael Kennedy>8,000 is taken.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Michael Kennedy>You can't run your app.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Why?

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Just go in there and type 8,000, find the thing, and press kill because you're like,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Michael Kennedy>stupid Claude code left that thing running, and I can't find it to kill it,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Michael Kennedy>so I'll do it here.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Or you can just see what ports are open, what's running, all sorts of stuff.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.980
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think it's super neat.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.380
<v Michael Kennedy>You install it on macOS via homebrew,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Michael Kennedy>or you can just download a DMG.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Michael Kennedy>So that's pretty cool.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.440
<v Michael Kennedy>And yeah, I mean, that's pretty much what I got to say about it,

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.220
<v Michael Kennedy>but it is nice.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Michael Kennedy>That's cool.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.540
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.880
<v Brian Okken>I don't like this is,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.180
<v Brian Okken>this is obviously I'm not even sure why I'm commenting on this,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.140
<v Brian Okken>but I,

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Brian Okken>I most have like one or two ports open when I'm working on a web app,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.180
<v Brian Okken>because I'm not heavy duty web developer.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Brian Okken>But yeah.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, the thing is you might not have very many,

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Michael Kennedy>but you can only have one app on that one.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.980
<v Michael Kennedy>And if it gets lost,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.800
<v Michael Kennedy>especially if the little AI thing goes off and does something

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Michael Kennedy>and then leaves it just dangling, you're like, oh, man.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, you got a rogue agent.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.960
<v Brian Okken>You got to hunt down.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, exactly.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Michael Kennedy>So even if you're just doing one, it's still valuable.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.700
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Pete.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Brian Okken>Well, what am I talking about?

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Brian Okken>I'm going to talk about making things faster and profiling.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:48.760
<v Brian Okken>So Henry Schreiner sent this to us, and he's a friend of the show, and we're fans of Henry

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.440
<v Brian Okken>Schreiner's work.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.100
<v Brian Okken>So he's a core developer.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.480
<v Brian Okken>The article is how we made Python's packaging library three times faster.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:07.660
<v Brian Okken>And this is cool because packaging is one of the heaviest hit packages on PyPI.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Brian Okken>Even though a lot of people might not pip install it themselves, it's used by a lot of other stuff.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:22.480
<v Brian Okken>And I, let's see, I often am doing it when I'll reach for packaging if I'm trying to compare versions.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:34.780
<v Brian Okken>At runtime, I'll say if I'm testing with something at 3.15 versus a different one or something like that, I'll often use packaging for grabbing versions.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.880
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, there's a bunch of fun stuff in the packaging package.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.500
<v Brian Okken>So how did they make it three times faster?

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.920
<v Brian Okken>The article talks about graphing and plotting and how he's figuring this out for a while.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.820
<v Brian Okken>And I'm going to scroll past all of that.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.540
<v Brian Okken>and talk about the actual updates.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.060
<v Brian Okken>And one of the things I love about this is,

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.260
<v Brian Okken>sometime, I mean,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.940
<v Brian Okken>we often hear about,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.540
<v Brian Okken>don't premature optimization is bad,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.180
<v Brian Okken>but there are times where you see stuff that's taking a while

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Brian Okken>and you're like, I really wish this was faster.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.780
<v Brian Okken>And so there is a time for optimization

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.440
<v Brian Okken>and often it goes along something like this.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.900
<v Brian Okken>It's you put some profiling together.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Brian Okken>You try to measure the different parts of it and then measure it and try to reproduce those,

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.060
<v Brian Okken>make sure they're consistent times so that they're not random.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.599
<v Brian Okken>But then you just do like 10% at a time.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:40.580
<v Brian Okken>So this is an interesting one of like 10% speed up of just stripping zeros out of stuff.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:49.000
<v Brian Okken>They had a reversed list,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.640
<v Brian Okken>iter tools drop while,

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Brian Okken>a way to reverse it,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.020
<v Brian Okken>to strip the zeros.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.400
<v Brian Okken>And they just made it a little different

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Brian Okken>and more actually more readable

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.120
<v Brian Okken>and less elegant,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.500
<v Brian Okken>but it's nice.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.900
<v Brian Okken>Instead of one line,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.000
<v Brian Okken>there's five lines of code with a for loop,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Brian Okken>but it sped up the whole thing by 10%.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.560
<v Brian Okken>And that's awesome.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.800
<v Brian Okken>And then, okay, so that's a little thing, 10% speed up.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Brian Okken>And then a faster regex, 10% to 17% faster on 3.11 and above only.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.720
<v Brian Okken>And that's another thing is sometimes newer versions of Python

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Brian Okken>have more tools at your disposal.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.720
<v Brian Okken>So you might have to have two implementations,

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Brian Okken>but why not make it faster for the newest?

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:47.260
<v Brian Okken>so that's pretty cool removing I don't actually get this removing single this but oh yeah removing

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:58.400
<v Brian Okken>single dispatch 7% faster remove duplicate version creation 37% faster awesome removing name tuples

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.719
<v Brian Okken>20% faster just all these different little tiny speed ups and they're like 10 to 20%

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Brian Okken>and in the end, it's a lot faster.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.920
<v Brian Okken>So I really like the write-ups on people

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.140
<v Brian Okken>just taking a little bit befores and afters.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.540
<v Brian Okken>And that doesn't mean to say

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Brian Okken>if you've got something that looks like the before code

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.340
<v Brian Okken>that you should speed it up,

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.420
<v Brian Okken>you should measure and make sure that it's readable.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.400
<v Brian Okken>I mean, I think the first goal is readability.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.780
<v Brian Okken>Next, measure to see if it's too slow or something.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:32.660
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Write it in the form of readable, understandable,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Michael Kennedy>and then figure out how to make it fast if needed.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, but there are tools available

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.160
<v Brian Okken>if you are ready to try to make things faster.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Indeed.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.520
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.420
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.540
<v Michael Kennedy>I have a...

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.880
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know how to phrase this.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:56.660
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it's not good.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's call this a not-good story,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.000
<v Michael Kennedy>but it's quite the story.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:05.900
<v Michael Kennedy>So this is AI's impact on dev companies, open source.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Michael Kennedy>We start with a quote from Simon Wilson's sort of link blog, which itself is a quote.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, so Adam Watham is the CEO of Tailwind Labs, which is the maker of Tailwind CSS.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:27.060
<v Michael Kennedy>And the story about what's happening right now with Tailwind CSS is bonkers.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, you would have never predicted it.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:38.300
<v Michael Kennedy>but once you hear the story you're like ah yes okay so from adam he actually did this 30 minute

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:46.100
<v Michael Kennedy>morning walk where he like sort of walks and talks and it's kind of like a journal but public

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Michael Kennedy>or something like that i guess and he says we had six months left it says i just laid off

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.740
<v Michael Kennedy>some of the most talented people I've ever worked with

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.860
<v Michael Kennedy>and it blink and sucks.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.360
<v Michael Kennedy>The direct written version is,

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Michael Kennedy>this all actually came from this thing called llms.txt,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.740
<v Michael Kennedy>which actually is pretty interesting.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Like robots.txt, but for LLMs,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.460
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm thinking about putting this on Python Bytes and stuff

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Michael Kennedy>to help LLMs be more efficient working with what we produce.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Michael Kennedy>So if somebody wants to ask a question like,

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.400
<v Michael Kennedy>what did Python Bytes say about this?

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Like what did Michael and Brian cover here

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.020
<v Michael Kennedy>and what was their advice?

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Right?

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.120
<v Michael Kennedy>If we put that as a, hey, LLM,

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.000
<v Michael Kennedy>you could technically scan the entire system

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:36.960
<v Michael Kennedy>and try to understand that.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Or you could use our search for these keywords

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.600
<v Michael Kennedy>and then here's how you access the transcript

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.960
<v Michael Kennedy>and then parts just, you know what I mean?

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.000
<v Michael Kennedy>You could give like a little advice.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.280
<v Michael Kennedy>So someone had proposed as a PR

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Michael Kennedy>to put that onto Tailwind and said,

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.539
<v Michael Kennedy>could you please put that onto the Tailwind documentation

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Michael Kennedy>so that we'll be more efficient talking to Tailwind

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.980
<v Michael Kennedy>or asking questions of Tailwind from our AI agents.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.540
<v Michael Kennedy>And people lost it.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.360
<v Michael Kennedy>People lost it.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.260
<v Michael Kennedy>It wasn't good.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.380
<v Michael Kennedy>And Adam said something to the effect of,

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Michael Kennedy>like, this actually is a pretty decent request,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.460
<v Michael Kennedy>but the reality is that 75% of the people

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.640
<v Michael Kennedy>in our engineering team lost their jobs yesterday

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.540
<v Michael Kennedy>because of the brutal impact of AI.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.240
<v Michael Kennedy>And if I add this feature, it's going to make it worse.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:32.880
<v Michael Kennedy>all right so here's the insane aspect yeah if you look at traffic to the if you look at

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.720
<v Michael Kennedy>downloads sorry on npm i guess that's traffic of a form if you look at the

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:44.940
<v Michael Kennedy>downloads of tailwind they're up six times year over year wow six times more usage

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:51.720
<v Michael Kennedy>don't you think that would make the product more viable no trap because if you go to the tailwinds

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.720
<v Michael Kennedy>documentation it's all free tailwinds open source but there's a thing that says get tailwind plus

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:05.660
<v Michael Kennedy>you see that in the docs however even though there's a 6x increase in usage there's a 40%

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:13.419
<v Michael Kennedy>drop in traffic to the documentation and revenue is down five times or down 80%

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:20.500
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah why because instead of going to the docs to get help you just say hey ai install tailwind and

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.220
<v Michael Kennedy>do this or you don't even say that you say make it pretty and like tailwind is the default

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.960
<v Michael Kennedy>styling mode of ai that's pretty sad huh

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:40.559
<v Brian Okken>yeah it definitely is um i don't yeah it it it sucks i don't know what the solution is

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:52.780
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't either. Avoiding llms.txt is probably not the answer, but it's also not a solution for sure. I mean, it might need a different business model. You know what I mean?

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.360
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I mean, we've both seen this as well.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:03.540
<v Brian Okken>Like I was faced with higher server costs on my blog.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:09.300
<v Brian Okken>And then I put in, you know, we talked about this earlier.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.380
<v Brian Okken>I put in monitoring to see who it was, and it was mostly robots.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.700
<v Brian Okken>And then I cut robots out, and we got zero traffic.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.080
<v Brian Okken>So I'm like, not zero.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.420
<v Michael Kennedy>That's not the answer either, though, is it?

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.000
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like saying I do not want to appear in Google because I hate the traffic.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.580
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, I know it's not exactly the same.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, that's the thing.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:40.420
<v Brian Okken>But with Google, they said if you don't let our robots in to scrape your site for our LLMs, then we're not going to scrape your site for search traffic either.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.260
<v Brian Okken>I think that's the thing.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.060
<v Brian Okken>And that's lame.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.060
<v Brian Okken>I think that you should be able to say, no, I don't want somebody to scrape my site for AI.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.880
<v Brian Okken>But please do keep looking at it for search.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:16:00.060
<v Michael Kennedy>can we just like just take a moment and just say that there are really good alternatives

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:08.900
<v Michael Kennedy>to google like start page like kagi yeah but a lot of them are all built off of the same data

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.540
<v Michael Kennedy>that google's selling and start page is built off the stuff so it is in a sense really really the

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:19.560
<v Michael Kennedy>same um yeah that's a good point okay i'm not even done with the story brian okay let's just

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's hear the rest of the drama.

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:22.740
<v Michael Kennedy>OK, so that's half the story.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.380
<v Michael Kennedy>There's a really good video by this guy.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.620
<v Michael Kennedy>I just came across Maximilian Schwarzmuller.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.100
<v Michael Kennedy>He does a bunch of great developer videos.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.220
<v Michael Kennedy>It's more of like a--

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.560
<v Michael Kennedy>And an awesome name.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I know.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Michael Kennedy>It is an awesome name.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.840
<v Michael Kennedy>He's more like a JavaScript-y guy,

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.500
<v Michael Kennedy>but he does a lot of just thought pieces

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.160
<v Michael Kennedy>on programming in general.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.140
<v Michael Kennedy>And he's good.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.640
<v Michael Kennedy>So he did a 11 minute, 55 second video on this tailwind

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.220
<v Michael Kennedy>is in deep trouble.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.820
<v Michael Kennedy>talks about it actually shows a lot of graphs and data and so it's pretty

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:56.560
<v Michael Kennedy>interesting then the other is video from the primogen and this is the other side

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:06.079
<v Michael Kennedy>of this is another company in the same theme and stack overflows cooked it's it

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.780
<v Michael Kennedy>is it is insane let me see if I can find a spot here let me see what I find a

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.199
<v Michael Kennedy>spot here with this graph so there's an insane graph if you watch that video but

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:22.939
<v Michael Kennedy>I can just tell you the words. I'll tell it to you more, Brian. So in, I don't have my show notes up,

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:28.140
<v Michael Kennedy>so I'm about to do this from memory, but I believe in the first month of Stack Overflow's life,

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:35.900
<v Michael Kennedy>there was 3,800 questions asked. Yeah. In 2009, I've got the notes up. Yeah. Okay. Almost,

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.160
<v Michael Kennedy>almost nothing. I mean, it's just getting going. It's like a forum. Like, no, of course,

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.920
<v Michael Kennedy>there's going to be almost no questions. It goes up and it stays 200,000 new questions asked per

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:58.380
<v Michael Kennedy>month, almost through the pandemic. And it starts going down. And this is not purely from AI. It's

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:05.860
<v Michael Kennedy>going down like pretty precipitously for two years before ChatGPD comes out. But when it does,

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.400
<v Michael Kennedy>in like mid-2022, it drops even harder.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So here's an insane stat.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.340
<v Michael Kennedy>In 2016, there were 200,000 new questions asked at Stack Overflow.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.140
<v Michael Kennedy>In 2026, well, technically last month in December 2025,

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Michael Kennedy>there were 3,740-something questions asked,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.480
<v Michael Kennedy>the same as the first month they opened.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.860
<v Michael Kennedy>200,000 to three or whatever, 3,000.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.600
<v Brian Okken>It's insane.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.300
<v Michael Kennedy>that

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.600
<v Michael Kennedy>that is insane

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.160
<v Michael Kennedy>so

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.080
<v Michael Kennedy>actually I think the prime engine

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.040
<v Michael Kennedy>guy's got a premium to prepare your goodbyes

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.320
<v Michael Kennedy>is pretty much it

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.540
<v Michael Kennedy>now it does seem to still be going strong

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.080
<v Michael Kennedy>selling this data

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.840
<v Michael Kennedy>this pure data in a sense

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.540
<v Michael Kennedy>to AI companies

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.020
<v Michael Kennedy>but for how long is that going to last

00:18:56.899 --> 00:18:57.660
<v Michael Kennedy>that's like a

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:03.200
<v Michael Kennedy>we don't have any cows left and we can't get milk

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.959
<v Michael Kennedy>but we got a lot of cheese that's really good

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:10.000
<v Michael Kennedy>in the freezer so we can sell that for a while until it's gone right until you're without new

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:16.040
<v Brian Okken>questions there's not new information there so um and who's answering even if there are new questions

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.300
<v Michael Kennedy>who's answering them you know yeah i bet you half of those three or four thousand are like ai generated

00:19:23.399 --> 00:19:27.559
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah i i honestly i can't believe this i knew that they were going down but

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Michael Kennedy>200,000 to a couple thousand is an insane level.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.140
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:41.960
<v Brian Okken>And they were actually one of the better ones as far as ads and sponsors and stuff.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:49.020
<v Brian Okken>I mean, Stack Overflow, we make fun of it and stuff, but it's a part of software and

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.060
<v Brian Okken>it wasn't really that spammy.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.300
<v Brian Okken>It just didn't have a bunch of pop-ups and stuff.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.200
<v Brian Okken>I actually kind of liked Stack Overflow.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I know.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.800
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, I don't know.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.420
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know exactly how to feel.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.780
<v Michael Kennedy>But it even went so far as we had the Stack Overflow keyboard

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.940
<v Michael Kennedy>that only had three keys.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:11.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Right?

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.540
<v Michael Kennedy>It had the, instead of the controller command,

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.240
<v Michael Kennedy>it had the Stack Overflow logo and then a C and a V.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Michael Kennedy>It's a beautiful joke.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Just, you know, that's how important that used to be.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.279
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, you take an error message

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.720
<v Brian Okken>and just throw it into Google search and you get a Stack Overflow question

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.380
<v Brian Okken>answering it. That's how you figure

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.320
<v Brian Okken>stuff out. Exactly. There was a period where we read

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.020
<v Michael Kennedy>books and then we copied and pasted from Stack Overflow and now

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.720
<v Michael Kennedy>I guess we copy and we just take it from AI but

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.120
<v Michael Kennedy>this, I think this is noteworthy in a big way

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.180
<v Michael Kennedy>in the developer world. This is big.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, and I mean, I know that the people behind Stack Overflow,

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.900
<v Brian Okken>there's a lot of money there.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:05.480
<v Brian Okken>And I think that the top of the chain, they're probably fine.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.080
<v Brian Okken>But everybody that got laid off, that's lame.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.800
<v Brian Okken>But Tailwind has always been a lightweight business model,

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.100
<v Brian Okken>even though they're doing some amazing things.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.420
<v Brian Okken>And like you said, it's being used by almost everyone.

00:21:22.539 --> 00:21:23.860
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, it's crazy.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Kiva out in the audience points out

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.520
<v Michael Kennedy>it's insane how symmetric this graph is

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Michael Kennedy>I agree, it is insane

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Michael Kennedy>it's like almost a perfect trapezoid

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.260
<v Michael Kennedy>not quite, but almost

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.440
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm pulling up stuff from the comment

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Henry points out that he's just a PyPA member

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.180
<v Michael Kennedy>and builds many, many Python things

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.420
<v Michael Kennedy>but not quite a core developer

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.659
<v Michael Kennedy>just to keep the record a little bit

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:56.920
<v Brian Okken>Okay. Well, Henry Schreiner is a core asset in my learning journey. I guess I'll put it that way.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.080
<v Brian Okken>Over to you.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:08.560
<v Brian Okken>Okay. I wanted to talk about Henry Schreiner's article. No. Similar. So we talked about Henry

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:15.660
<v Brian Okken>Schreiner's article on Python packaging and making it faster. And it reminded me of something that I

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.740
<v Brian Okken>wanted to talk about for a while and I just forgot about. So thanks, Henry, for the reminder.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:26.060
<v Brian Okken>And it was because I was, and it's around profiling. So I was looking through,

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:36.560
<v Brian Okken>not the packaging library, I was looking through FastAPI once looking at their, I kind of do this,

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:42.059
<v Brian Okken>I kind of troll sometimes, I go through GitHub workflows of different packages to see

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.280
<v Brian Okken>what sort of tricks they're using in their workflows.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Brian Okken>And I remember seeing...

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.680
<v Brian Okken>It's like the view source of the modern day.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:49.780
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, workflows.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.760
<v Brian Okken>And it's one of the wonderful things

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.660
<v Brian Okken>about open source packages is you can do this.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.040
<v Brian Okken>So FastAPI, plus the folks at FastAPI

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.420
<v Brian Okken>are really great about trying to stay cutting edge

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.720
<v Brian Okken>and helping other people.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.900
<v Brian Okken>So looking through here, I saw COD speed benchmarks.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.740
<v Brian Okken>And I'm like, what is this?

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.700
<v Brian Okken>So that's my topic right now is the cod speed tool.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.400
<v Brian Okken>And it's probably, maybe it's code speed, but it's spelled C-O-D.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.020
<v Brian Okken>So I'm going to pronounce it cod speed.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.640
<v Michael Kennedy>It could be measured in like how fast does a cod swim in the ocean?

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.700
<v Michael Kennedy>And this is like a metric.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.380
<v Brian Okken>Is it a laden cod or a?

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.040
<v Brian Okken>A heavily laden cod.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Bite your knee calves off, get back here.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:54.460
<v Brian Okken>So I'll talk about the actual tool, but as we're looking through FastAPI, there's also in the merge requests for new features, there's a performance report that is linked, and you can go and take a look at it.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.360
<v Brian Okken>if you can click on that you go and see like you can go and poke around at that particular merge

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:09.280
<v Brian Okken>request i'm looking at the overview because fast api on codspeed.io has um this uh a graph of make

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.680
<v Brian Okken>basically making is not very noisy of like the different different times they've measured things

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.020
<v Brian Okken>and how the uh metrics the performance metrics have gone up and down and it's really kind of cool

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.220
<v Brian Okken>So I was like, can I use this?

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:22.200
<v Brian Okken>Yes.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.100
<v Brian Okken>So I'm going to try this out.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.940
<v Brian Okken>I haven't tried it yet, but at codspeed.io,

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.800
<v Brian Okken>and there's a nice rabbit logo, which is nice.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, it integrates into dev and CI workflows

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.820
<v Brian Okken>to measure performance, detect regressions.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.780
<v Brian Okken>And if it was just a paid tool,

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.220
<v Brian Okken>I wouldn't probably be covering it.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.979
<v Brian Okken>But it's one of those awesome tools

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.580
<v Brian Okken>that's actually not that expensive per month

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Brian Okken>if you're actually paying for it for your project,

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.720
<v Brian Okken>for a commercial product.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.820
<v Brian Okken>But it's free for open source projects.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.860
<v Brian Okken>So I love those sorts of things.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.580
<v Brian Okken>They're given back to the community with free tools.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Brian Okken>It's great.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.660
<v Brian Okken>So what I wanted to talk about is,

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:15.020
<v Brian Okken>if we go back to the homepage, it's pretty cool.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:21.780
<v Brian Okken>one of the things that talks about um is you know catching performance and not noisy metrics so i'm

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.540
<v Brian Okken>not sure how they're doing this but they're they're saying that the traditional metrics kind of jump

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:32.400
<v Michael Kennedy>around a lot but that cod speed has got a small variance it's possible that they run this on

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:41.019
<v Michael Kennedy>dedicated hardware so you're not subjected to you know other things on the other noise yeah um so

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.560
<v Brian Okken>They're doing flame graphs to pinpoint problems and speed ups and slow downs.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.080
<v Brian Okken>But one of the things I was really impressed with is right there on the front page,

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:56.120
<v Brian Okken>they tell you that you can design performance tests, integrate with your CI workflow, and get reports.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.700
<v Brian Okken>And there's like a Python button you can click on.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:06.720
<v Brian Okken>And it's like, oh, you just mark whatever test with pytestMark benchmark.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.640
<v Brian Okken>And those are the ones that are used in your benchmarks.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:10.580
<v Brian Okken>It's easy.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.660
<v Brian Okken>you're already using them for testing your code so you can just grab some of your maybe some of

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:21.760
<v Brian Okken>your high level tests that test the whole system um and try to hit and hit you know grab a handful

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.620
<v Brian Okken>of them that hit most of your system might be good you can throw them on all of them maybe i don't

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:34.839
<v Brian Okken>know um and then uh what do you do in ci so what once you to try to integrate it in ci there's there's

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.880
<v Brian Okken>tabs for GitLab and GitHub.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.320
<v Brian Okken>But they already, for GitHub Actions,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.080
<v Brian Okken>they have their own action that you can use.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.300
<v Brian Okken>And you just say, use that,

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.480
<v Brian Okken>and then run whatever your code is.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.440
<v Brian Okken>So I went back to, what, FastAPI's workflow

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.420
<v Brian Okken>to see what that was.

00:26:54.399 --> 00:26:56.340
<v Brian Okken>And their metrics, when they're running,

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Brian Okken>is just, they're just running pytest.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.100
<v Brian Okken>It looks like they give it a codspeed flag.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.080
<v Brian Okken>I don't know what that does.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.580
<v Brian Okken>but maybe it does some cod speed stuff.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.040
<v Brian Okken>Just fun.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.360
<v Brian Okken>I thought it'd be good to give a shout out to these folks,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.460
<v Brian Okken>and I'll try it out on one of my projects

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Brian Okken>and maybe report back how it's going.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Brian Okken>But you can look directly how FastAPI is using it.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.180
<v Brian Okken>It's pretty cool.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, two quick real-time follow-ups.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm going to be interviewing Sebastian Ramirez

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.100
<v Michael Kennedy>and his team about FastAPI Cloud tomorrow on Talk Python.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:33.160
<v Michael Kennedy>nice

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:34.100
<v Michael Kennedy>so

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.200
<v Michael Kennedy>and maybe if I

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.600
<v Michael Kennedy>can keep it in my mind

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:36.740
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll ask them about this

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:38.740
<v Michael Kennedy>as well

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Michael Kennedy>it's pretty interesting

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:40.460
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.020
<v Michael Kennedy>but people want to watch that live

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Michael Kennedy>that's tomorrow morning

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Michael Kennedy>and then

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:44.900
<v Michael Kennedy>um

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Henry points out that

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:46.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Astral

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.200
<v Michael Kennedy>uses COD Speed

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.720
<v Michael Kennedy>and that was mentioned

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:50.920
<v Michael Kennedy>when people are asking about

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.920
<v Michael Kennedy>proper benchmarking

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.460
<v Michael Kennedy>for packaging

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:53.920
<v Brian Okken>hmm

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:55.780
<v Brian Okken>that

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.620
<v Brian Okken>that might have been

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Brian Okken>where I saw it

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:57.980
<v Brian Okken>so

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.260
<v Brian Okken>yeah

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.300
<v Brian Okken>all right

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.140
<v Brian Okken>um

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.600
<v Brian Okken>Well, those are our topics.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.240
<v Brian Okken>Do you have any extras for us?

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's see what I have.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.740
<v Michael Kennedy>I indeed do have some extras.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:18.040
<v Michael Kennedy>So remember how I talked about DevOps, Python, supply chain security made easy,

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.640
<v Michael Kennedy>and Python supply chain security made easy and all that.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.900
<v Michael Kennedy>And I gave some examples using pip audit,

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:31.180
<v Michael Kennedy>how to set up cached build time checks so that your Docker images won't build.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.560
<v Michael Kennedy>if there's a CVE detected?

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:35.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, yeah.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, boy, oh, boy.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:41.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Are there more CVEs in the PyPI space that I realized?

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Because just middle of last week, I couldn't ship Python bytes

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.700
<v Michael Kennedy>because there's a vulnerability here.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.700
<v Michael Kennedy>We're not going to let it out.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.720
<v Michael Kennedy>So here's the cool thing.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:52.960
<v Michael Kennedy>It absolutely caught it.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.180
<v Michael Kennedy>It wouldn't let me release a new one.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.280
<v Michael Kennedy>But it is a hassle.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.340
<v Michael Kennedy>And I've also run into a little bit of a bigger hassle.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.260
<v Michael Kennedy>bigger a unforeseen hassle i said okay well what we're going to do is we're going to delay updating

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:12.520
<v Michael Kennedy>to the new thing by one week to make sure that that stuff gets fixed well turns out

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.840
<v Michael Kennedy>when they find a problem they fix it and they release it that day but if i apply that technique

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:24.240
<v Michael Kennedy>it doesn't get rolled into my stuff for a week so got to be a little bit careful to just sort of

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.860
<v Michael Kennedy>pin some stuff for a little bit or not just don't up to update the dependencies until you get that

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Michael Kennedy>or if it's not, you know, whatever you're going to do about it, right?

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.560
<v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, it works because I couldn't release the website

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Michael Kennedy>until I manually put different versions in to make it skip those issues.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.760
<v Michael Kennedy>That's good. It's a good thing.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.160
<v Michael Kennedy>All right, on to the next one.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.580
<v Michael Kennedy>You probably have heard, Brian, that anytime you're doing security,

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.920
<v Michael Kennedy>you need to have a decent password.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.700
<v Michael Kennedy>You know this as a user, but if you build anything that has user auth,

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, you want to have some level of complexity?

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:04.560
<v Michael Kennedy>I feel like there's so many web builders out there that just suck so bad.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.080
<v Michael Kennedy>You're like, how do they let you behind a keyboard?

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.280
<v Michael Kennedy>For example, one of my banks, this is an international bank,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.940
<v Michael Kennedy>limits my password length, not minimum, maximum to like 12 characters.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.340
<v Michael Kennedy>That's insane.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.080
<v Michael Kennedy>That is just the stupidest.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, are you putting that straight in the database?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Because if that's because that's a database constraint,

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.200
<v Michael Kennedy>You better not be putting my password straight in the database.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:27.720
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Really bad.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.780
<v Michael Kennedy>But at the extreme end.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Does the length affect what the hash length looks like?

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.320
<v Michael Kennedy>No, the hash is the same length from one character and a million characters.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.380
<v Michael Kennedy>That's why I'm sus of it.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.120
<v Michael Kennedy>You know?

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.600
<v Michael Kennedy>But there are actually some nuanced aspects.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.180
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you're using MD5 to hash your passwords, no.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Don't do it.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:55.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Please don't do it.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.180
<v Michael Kennedy>But there's some really nice things you can do.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Like you can use more modern ones.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:08.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And especially something that you can do that's really powerful is to use what are called memory hard problems.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:17.980
<v Michael Kennedy>So cracking passwords is an embarrassingly parallel problem in that like I've got a hash and I'm going to try a bunch of different stuff against it.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.300
<v Michael Kennedy>And if I got a GPU, maybe I run like 4,000 variations in parallel.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.060
<v Michael Kennedy>And if any of those match, then we call it good.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:29.000
<v Michael Kennedy>and use all the cores, that's because GPUs scale compute super well.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.260
<v Michael Kennedy>But you know what they don't scale well? Memory.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:35.900
<v Michael Kennedy>And so one of the new-ish algorithms is called Argon2.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:43.320
<v Michael Kennedy>It's really highly recommended because it is not subject to this brute force attack.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Because instead of using a lot of compute, it uses a lot of memory.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Michael Kennedy>So you can't parallelize that as easy.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.940
<v Michael Kennedy>You're like, well, each hash takes, I don't know, 15 megs to do an attempt.

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:58.880
<v Michael Kennedy>So how many of those can you parallelize before you run out of memory sort of thing?

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:08.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, it turns out that this has become a point of a problem.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:17.280
<v Michael Kennedy>So hackers have started using, as a distributed denial of service type of thing, very long passwords.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:26.040
<v Michael Kennedy>so like one megabytes worth of text of password because the argon 2 and the memory hard ones

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.980
<v Michael Kennedy>the bigger the password is the bigger the text is the more memory they use

00:32:32.419 --> 00:32:40.400
<v Michael Kennedy>so if you just jam like an insane amount of text all of a sudden it becomes not just memory hard

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.260
<v Michael Kennedy>for hackers but even for your server it's like okay this is off the charts right so i just want

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Michael Kennedy>put this out there on people's radar like prudus out there says my bank also restricts password

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:56.800
<v Michael Kennedy>length boo banks they suck but maybe they shouldn't allow a million characters like

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:04.860
<v Michael Kennedy>limited to 100 or 50 something way bigger than you're going to do but like not unbounded right

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Michael Kennedy>don't just say less than it's a super easy check but this is definitely something to keep your

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.380
<v Brian Okken>your radar on.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Brian Okken>Character restrictions are terrible also.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.360
<v Brian Okken>The ones that say you can't use some special characters.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.040
<v Brian Okken>Why would you not be able to use special characters?

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:20.720
<v Brian Okken>Exactly.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.740
<v Michael Kennedy>I honestly think a good chunk of this,

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.640
<v Michael Kennedy>and maybe this is the bank thing as well,

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.020
<v Michael Kennedy>it's a tech support thing.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Somebody who is like 78,

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.560
<v Michael Kennedy>doesn't really know what they're doing,

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.300
<v Michael Kennedy>can't type in their password,

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:37.860
<v Michael Kennedy>they're like,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.900
<v Michael Kennedy>I called tech support,

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.720
<v Michael Kennedy>and they're going to help me type it in or something.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.600
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't even know.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.440
<v Michael Kennedy>But I feel like it's--

00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:48.080
<v Michael Kennedy>restrict the characters use, so they're more legible.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.820
<v Michael Kennedy>But why would you allow an L and a 1?

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.220
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:51.880
<v Michael Kennedy>It's all messed up.

00:33:54.179 --> 00:33:55.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Or an O and a 0.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, can't use zeros.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.220
<v Michael Kennedy>You only can use O's or vice versa.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Brian Okken>Well, the ones that require you to use a number also,

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.340
<v Brian Okken>it just seems weird.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:06.800
<v Brian Okken>It's like these particular 10 characters are special,

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.879
<v Brian Okken>And we need one of those 10 to be in,

00:34:10.419 --> 00:34:12.720
<v Brian Okken>of all the possible characters, these 10.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.040
<v Brian Okken>That's a really good point.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.379
<v Michael Kennedy>Makes me so frustrated.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.600
<v Michael Kennedy>I have one password generate these,

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.159
<v Michael Kennedy>like ones that are easier to type

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.639
<v Michael Kennedy>if you got to type them on your phone or something,

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.440
<v Michael Kennedy>but they're like 30 characters.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.419
<v Michael Kennedy>And capital words, lowercase words, dashes,

00:34:27.419 --> 00:34:29.760
<v Michael Kennedy>and it says, you don't have a number

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.139
<v Michael Kennedy>or a special character.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.120
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, do you really think

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:32.919
<v Michael Kennedy>it's going to make a difference

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.419
<v Michael Kennedy>if there's an exclamation mark

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.600
<v Michael Kennedy>on this 30 character random?

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:37.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, no.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, I am here with you.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:39.740
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:40.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Last extra.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:48.000
<v Michael Kennedy>I sold my computer and bought a new one at this place called Swappa.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:56.740
<v Michael Kennedy>So I kind of want to talk about Swappa really quick because I just think this is a good alternative to buying computers from Apple directly.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.300
<v Michael Kennedy>It's kind of like eBay, but specifically for computers.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.380
<v Michael Kennedy>So you don't buy it from the company.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.940
<v Michael Kennedy>they facilitate you buying it from another person,

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.380
<v Michael Kennedy>which I think is kind of interesting.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.660
<v Michael Kennedy>So I had this Mac Mini super minimum version

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.180
<v Michael Kennedy>that I had bought with some trade-ins

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.040
<v Michael Kennedy>that effectively I paid like $360.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.580
<v Michael Kennedy>I sold it for $600 on here

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.780
<v Michael Kennedy>and then turned around

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.660
<v Michael Kennedy>and bought a maxed-out Mac Mini Pro version,

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.080
<v Michael Kennedy>which has got like 14 cores and lots more memory,

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:37.700
<v Michael Kennedy>like a lot of upgrades for like $1,700 instead of $3,000.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:43.300
<v Michael Kennedy>And you apply the $600, and it gets like, hey, that's almost nothing in price.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Michael Kennedy>So someone was saying like, oh, hey, I don't have an Apple Silicon thing,

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.900
<v Michael Kennedy>and I need to do builds for it, and what a hassle that is.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:57.160
<v Michael Kennedy>So like even the most brand-new Mac minis are for sale for like $400 or $500.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:02.200
<v Michael Kennedy>But if you look and you just want, I just need an Apple Silicon thing,

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:11.220
<v Michael Kennedy>You could go to the 2020 ones, and it's like $280 for a new, not new, but mint-ish computer, right?

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Like a decent M1 if you need to grasp.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:19.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, I thought I'd just throw that out there because I had a nice experience both buying and selling my computers there.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:24.420
<v Michael Kennedy>And now I got like a really maxed out one, which I used to make my Unitesco twice as fast.

00:36:25.619 --> 00:36:25.980
<v Brian Okken>Nice.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:26.640
<v Brian Okken>That was fun.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:27.500
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.000
<v Brian Okken>Nice segue there.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:30.900
<v Brian Okken>Over to you.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:39.320
<v Brian Okken>So as an extra, I've got actually, so you all know I've been working on a new book.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.380
<v Brian Okken>So Lean TDD.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:50.220
<v Brian Okken>And I'm kind of excited about this update because I was working on just the next chapter.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Brian Okken>And then it was getting big.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.200
<v Brian Okken>And I was writing a lot.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.580
<v Brian Okken>So I decided to break it up.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.820
<v Brian Okken>So I split the book into three parts.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.980
<v Brian Okken>There's foundations that's talking about Lean and TDD.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.840
<v Brian Okken>and I think I want to expand the TDD.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.840
<v Brian Okken>I've got some questions on test-driven development

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Brian Okken>from people that were new to it.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.860
<v Brian Okken>I just sort of assumed everybody knew about TDD.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.900
<v Brian Okken>So I'll probably expand that later.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.520
<v Brian Okken>So I've got foundations.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Brian Okken>And then what I released today, this morning,

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:24.780
<v Brian Okken>was, what is it, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 new chapters

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.260
<v Brian Okken>on part two, which is Lean TDD Practices.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.380
<v Brian Okken>And so instead of dumping this all in one big chapter, I split it all up.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.960
<v Brian Okken>And some of these are, to be fair, in a PDF form, some of these are a couple pages.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.880
<v Brian Okken>So there'll be like three or four pages in your EPUB.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.160
<v Brian Okken>But it's a lean book as well.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.480
<v Brian Okken>So I think that the total right now, I'm up to like 70 pages.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Brian Okken>After this, I do want to try to wrap this up by the end of this month still.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:00.820
<v Brian Okken>So I've got a couple weeks left.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.360
<v Brian Okken>I've got the last part is considerations.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:07.340
<v Brian Okken>I want to cover the role of test engineers if you have them on your team

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.260
<v Brian Okken>and also talk about test coverage and monitoring.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:18.320
<v Brian Okken>But it's only a few topics I've got left, and that will wrap up the first draft.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:24.780
<v Brian Okken>So I've been really excited about the flow and getting this in here.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.020
<v Brian Okken>It is funny, though.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:35.780
<v Brian Okken>Things that you think you just know in your head when you try to write it down in a sequential form, it's like, wait, how should I phrase this?

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:42.040
<v Brian Okken>I thought I could just talk about this easy, but trying to get it out of your head is sometimes tricky.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.460
<v Brian Okken>So that's my thing.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:55.740
<v Brian Okken>I also appreciate, so I had set up a GitHub repo that doesn't have the book, but it has just a place for stuff.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.400
<v Brian Okken>It's Lean TDD book under Aachen for feedback.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.980
<v Brian Okken>And not very many people were using it,

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.680
<v Brian Okken>but just recently I want to shout out to Timothy Malahi.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.180
<v Brian Okken>He gave me a bunch of stuff, like look through a bunch of typos.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.760
<v Brian Okken>I really appreciate that.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.440
<v Brian Okken>And then some other ideas about maybe expanding on some sections.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.140
<v Brian Okken>So I like the feedback.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:22.840
<v Brian Okken>Awesome.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.040
<v Brian Okken>Congrats on the progress too.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.060
<v Brian Okken>Thanks.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, that's my extra. How about something funny?

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, let's do something funny over here.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:39.860
<v Michael Kennedy>So this one is about how amazing agentic coding is,

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.780
<v Michael Kennedy>even if you don't even know anything about programming.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.480
<v Michael Kennedy>You don't know anything about the web, Brian. You can do it.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Here's a quote. I believe this is on Reddit.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Claude Code is blanking insane.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.840
<v Michael Kennedy>I know literally nothing, all caps, about coding.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.260
<v Michael Kennedy>zero all caps.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.640
<v Michael Kennedy>And I built a fully functioning web app in minutes.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Check it out at localhost, colon, 3000.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:09.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Nope.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Nope, we're not going to be checking it out at 3000

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.120
<v Michael Kennedy>because you know nothing.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.320
<v Michael Kennedy>That's funny.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.740
<v Michael Kennedy>I think that captures the end of 2025 vibes

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.900
<v Michael Kennedy>as just like, it's amazing and terrible.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.080
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:29.960
<v Brian Okken>Well, I mean, when do we get AIs that can deploy for you?

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.260
<v Brian Okken>Are we there yet?

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:32.680
<v Brian Okken>Far away.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:38.100
<v Michael Kennedy>I just had Claude Code helping me set up a special WebSocket.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:45.500
<v Michael Kennedy>HTTP to WebSocket to secure WebSocket conversion on Nginx,

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.120
<v Michael Kennedy>and it was like, here, boom, perfect.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.020
<v Michael Kennedy>But you got to know to ask, right?

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:51.660
<v Michael Kennedy>That's the thing.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:53.960
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.960
<v Michael Kennedy>But these are weird times.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:40:59.960
<v Michael Kennedy>They're very weird times.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.120
<v Brian Okken>They're weird times.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:03.780
<v Brian Okken>But we're still hanging in there.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.900
<v Brian Okken>And if you're hanging in there too and hanging in with us,

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.980
<v Brian Okken>I really appreciate everybody listening to the episode,

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.460
<v Brian Okken>listening to Python Bytes,

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.040
<v Brian Okken>and supporting us through all of the different means.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.000
<v Brian Okken>And, yeah, we're going to do this as long as we can.

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.880
<v Brian Okken>So thanks, Michael.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:22.600
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:23.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Thank you, Brian.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.480
<v Michael Kennedy>see you later

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:24.960
<v Michael Kennedy>bye everyone

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:25.300
<v Michael Kennedy>bye
