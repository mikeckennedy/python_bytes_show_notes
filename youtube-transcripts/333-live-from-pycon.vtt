00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
- Hello Brian.


00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.080
- Hi.


00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.500
I guess I shouldn't look like you here


00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.820
'cause the camera's right there.


00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.660
- It's right there?


00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.480
- Yeah.


00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.680
Hey, welcome everybody and welcome.


00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.600
We've got a whole room full of people.


00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.360
We're recording this live.


00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.240
- How about we get a live from PyCon shout out?


00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.080
(audience cheering)


00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.920
There we go.


00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.240
Thank you all.


00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.080
- Okay.


00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.680
- Why did that stop?


00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.520
(laughing)


00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.480
- So welcome everybody.


00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.880
If you're in the live stream, thanks for showing up.


00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.640
And if you're watching later, thank you.


00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.340
We're going -- we're dealing with some technical difficulties,


00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.860
and then we will start the show.


00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.960
Hmm?


00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.580
>> You're upsetting the camera.


00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.680
>> Hi.


00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.080
>> You're upsetting the camera.


00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.080
[ Inaudible ]


00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.540
>> So everybody -- not?


00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.700
I guess it's only the livestream people that would care about this, so.


00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
Okay. That'll work.


00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.300
All right.


00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.960
Okay, that'll work.


00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.980
All right, well, so are you ready to start, Michael?


00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.020
- I am ready to start, I guess.


00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.560
- All right, hello and welcome to Python Bytes,


00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.420
where we deliver Python news and headlines


00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.600
directly to your earbuds.


00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.600
This is episode 333, half of a beast,


00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.780
recorded April 21st, 2023.


00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.620
And I am Brian Okken.


00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.980
- And I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.300
And we are live at PyCon US 2023.


00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.860
- Yeah, it's excellent to be here.


00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.900
Thanks everyone for coming.


00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.100
It's awesome, it's a real honor.


00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.260
(audience applauding)


00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.260
- So, shall we kick off the show?


00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.180
- Let's kick off the show.


00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.500
I think first, I'd just like maybe


00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.060
to get your thoughts real quick on PyCon, the expo, people.


00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.540
How's it feeling this year?


00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.820
- Well, it's the first time I've been back from the,


00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.120
I didn't show up last year, so I'm pretty excited.


00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.240
It's really good to see people.


00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.760
There's people that I haven't seen in person since 2019.


00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.920
So it's pretty awesome.


00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.760
How about you?


00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.840
- Same, it's really great to reconnect


00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.640
with a bunch of people and see folks


00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.560
I haven't seen for a long time.


00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.680
So really nice.


00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.120
- Yeah, it's been great.


00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.960
Plus we got the Python staff this year.


00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.520
- Yeah, the Python, the staff of stuff, Python things.


00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.000
So I wanna talk about something that's all the rage


00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.240
and I do wanna put that on the screen


00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.200
for the live stream people as well.


00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.360
And that is more AI chat things.


00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.920
What do you all think about ChatGPT and all these things?


00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.700
Is this scary or is it scary or is it awesome?


00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.800
Like, ah, we're getting, yeah, all right.


00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.680
It's pretty mixed.


00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.880
I think that represents how I've felt.


00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.920
I felt like everyone out there at different stages


00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.360
in this whole journey.


00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.920
- Yeah.


00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.000
What we saw is a whole bunch of thumbs up


00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.180
and a lot of sideways.


00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.320
So we're not quite sure yet what we think of it.


00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.080
We're not quite sure yet.


00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.120
But it's one of those things that's kind of here,


00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.800
the cat is out of the bag, we can either rail against it


00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.080
or find good uses for it to take advantage of it.


00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.880
So Microsoft has found a way to use


00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.680
their large language models behind OpenAI


00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.040
and the stuff that powers ChatGPT


00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.580
to help security defenders, they say.


00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.680
Like if I'm on the blue team trying to stop people


00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.820
from breaking into my company,


00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.380
I could use a little bit of help with that.


00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.100
And you can already use ChatGPT for all sorts of


00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.240
crazy programming and security type of things, right?


00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.580
You can say, "Hey, dear chat,


00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.380
I would love if you could help me write a phishing email


00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.380
that looks convincing,


00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.340
or I would like you to help me identify


00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.460
things I might test for a misconfiguration in GenX files


00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.060
and what I might do with that."


00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.780
Those are all bad things,


00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.780
But this project here is called Microsoft Security Co-Pilot.


00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.220
It says empowering defenders at the speed of AI.


00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.700
And so basically what this is, is it's ChatGPT,


00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.100
but instead of using a general purpose language model,


00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.340
it's using a cybersecurity focused large language model


00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.540
that understands things like don't let me get hacked,


00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.900
buffer overflows, configuration files, that kind of stuff.


00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.140
So if you're in the space of cybersecurity,


00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.280
which Python is one of the most popular languages


00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.460
out there for cybersecurity, right?


00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.400
Both sides of it, the good and the bad.


00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.460
But yeah, so basically you give it a prompt,


00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.800
you ask it a question about a configuration file


00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.280
or some kind of environment,


00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.920
and it'll go and use that large language model.


00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.100
And it doesn't always get it right.


00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.660
This is one of the big challenges,


00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.420
Maybe some of the thumbs down from you all were like,


00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.760
you know, this large language model made up something


00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.000
about the world or whatever, but it was real confident.


00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.960
It was certain it was right, but it wasn't.


00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.440
So this has a feedback loop.


00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.320
You can say, no, no, that's actually not misconfigured,


00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.800
dear security co-pilot thing.


00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.520
That was okay, and here's why.


00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.520
And so you can have this loop that you would have


00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.760
with a junior cybersecurity researcher or whatever.


00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.840
And another thing that I don't really


00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.320
know how all these large language models work


00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.440
and all this AI stuff works, much of it


00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.080
seems to be we're going to go find a bunch of other people's


00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.560
work and then take that.


00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.360
We'll have a really cool system with this cool data.


00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.160
We're going to scan different repos.


00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.720
And maybe it doesn't matter if it's


00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.880
GPL if we filter the GPL out through some kind of neural net


00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.000
or get all the Getty images and now we can create


00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.680
really cool pictures if you ask for it


00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.120
but the Getty wasn't on board with that.


00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.120
So this data story is kind of a little suspicious for these


00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.720
but with this one they explicitly say


00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.840
your data does not get shared back,


00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.160
it doesn't go anywhere, this is like,


00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.360
you can even lock it down about how other people


00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.720
are allowed to access.


00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.240
So that's kind of cool.


00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.640
And yeah, they're basically trying


00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.640
to help people go through log files and other things


00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.600
on the server where people are trying to hide their tracks,


00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.560
behaving normally but not really,


00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.160
and pull those things out.


00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.560
Now, I have no experience with this,


00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.520
but I know I interviewed some folks on Talk Python


00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.520
who are astronomers looking for exoplanets.


00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.580
And they were able to take old Kepler data


00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.340
and apply some machine learning and computer vision


00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.460
and discover 50 new exoplanets


00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.460
that people thought they had already analyzed.


00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.300
And guess what?


00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.120
They were hiding.


00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.100
They couldn't be discovered by people,


00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.140
but by computers they could.


00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.500
I suspect the same type of thing is true here.


00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.120
Like there's 10 million lines of log file


00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.900
and these three are suspicious,


00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.340
but nobody really noticed, you know?


00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.180
So anyway, if you're in cybersecurity,


00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.540
definitely give this a look.


00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.940
It looks pretty interesting.


00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.540
- It does look interesting.


00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.380
Great.


00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.780
I know exactly who I want to show this to.


00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.620
- Oh, right on.


00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.340
- Yeah, good one.


00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.180
- Thanks.


00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.940
- So next I want,


00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.900
and I should have thought of this ahead of time,


00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.340
but we've got a bunch of people here


00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.740
that can't see our screens,


00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.080
and I do, which is a good reminder


00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.460
that this is also an audio podcast.


00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.940
It's not just on YouTube, apparently.


00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.540
So the next topic I'll have to be careful talking about,


00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.540
but it's PEP 695 type parameter syntax.


00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.600
Now this is, this PEP is an,


00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.140
it's for Python version 3.12.


00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.620
It's accepted, so I don't know if it's already


00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.580
in some of the alphas or betas or not.


00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.420
- Yeah, I don't know either.


00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.700
- But we've got, so it's accepted for 3.12,


00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.340
type parameter syntax.


00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.820
The abstract is this PEP specifies an improved syntax


00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.040
for specifying type parameters


00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.280
within a generic class function or type alias.


00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.160
It also introduces a new statement


00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.980
for declaring type aliases.


00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.720
What does that mean?


00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.560
Well, I like to, it has some great examples.


00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.520
So if we go down to the examples,


00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:17.580
it's the old way, like let's say I've got,


00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.480
one of the examples is great.


00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.540
So let's say I've got a function,


00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.620
like that takes, it takes something.


00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.740
We don't know what the type is, but it takes something


00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.100
and then it returns the same type or it takes something.


00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.300
It takes two of, it has to have two of the same type things.


00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.380
- Doesn't matter what they are.


00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.220
- Doesn't matter what they are.


00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.040
- But they have to match.


00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.620
- So like two ints or two floats or two lists


00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.540
or two tuples, it doesn't matter what,


00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.860
but it's the same thing.


00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.300
The old way to do that,


00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.500
which is I still think it's fairly recent.


00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.140
I think this might've been 311 for type var.


00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.460
- It's pretty new, I think, so yeah.


00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.300
- Yeah, so-


00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.460
- I'm laughing because it's rolling over so quickly, right?


00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.480
- Yeah, so the, anyway, the old way to do it


00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.780
was from typing import type var,


00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.300
I didn't even know you could do this,


00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.660
and then you declare a new type using,


00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.620
like in this example, underscore T equals type var,


00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.500
and then in parentheses, underscore T,


00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.740
And then you can use that as the type of arguments.


00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.420
And that's really kind of ugly syntax.


00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.060
And the new proposed syntax is to just give a bracket,


00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.220
like bracket T bracket after the function to say,


00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.460
basically it's a templated function.


00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.900
- Like all the other generic statically type languages


00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.020
like C and stuff, right?


00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.600
- Yeah, so it definitely reminds me of like the type,


00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.380
yeah, the-


00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.220
- Templates.


00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.540
- Templates, thank you.


00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.320
in C++ and stuff.


00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.900
So it's definitely easier.


00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.700
I still, I'm not sure.


00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.540
So it's approved.


00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.900
So we'll get this in 3.12.


00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.680
It's definitely better than the old way,


00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.660
but it's still, I think we might be confusing people


00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.500
with this.


00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.600
- I think types in Python are awesome,


00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.300
but I think it can also go too far.


00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.860
(laughing)


00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.700
I mean, let's ask it since you all are here,


00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.540
let's ask how many people like typing in Python?


00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.300
Almost uniformly.


00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.780
Yeah, yeah.


00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.500
but it can get, can get over the top sometimes I think. Yeah. Yeah.


00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.380
Um, one of the things though is cool.


00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.920
And then one of the bottom examples in this, it shows that combining types.


00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.980
So like maybe a function that takes two of the same type things,


00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.540
maybe that's a little weird, but if it's not too weird,


00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.780
if you think of like lists of things, if I want to say it's, it,


00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.420
it's, it's can either be a list or a set of a, of a certain type,


00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.280
but only one type, how do you say that


00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.840
without these generics?


00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.680
- Yeah, yeah, no.


00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.960
- So, yeah, I think--


00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.880
- It is incomplete, and so it's the question


00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.600
of how far are you gonna push the language


00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.360
to get that last couple percent.


00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.480
- Anyway, it is looking a lot more like C, isn't it?


00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.440
- I'm glad I studied that,


00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.160
but also glad I don't have to write it these days.


00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.720
- So, something to look forward to in Python 3.12


00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.520
is PEP 695.


00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.360
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.560
While we're riffing on type-streaming,


00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.640
I just wanna make a quick comment.


00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.480
I got a message from somebody recently on this project.


00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.560
Said, Michael, I discovered a bug in your code.


00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.480
It doesn't run.


00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.560
Like, oh really?


00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.960
It seemed like it ran last time I touched it.


00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.280
But OK, what's going on?


00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.520
Well, you just used the lowercase l list bracket type.


00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.200
And only capital L list works.


00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.840
Like, no, the bug is you're in Python 3.9, not 3.10.


00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.120
This is a new feature.


00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.920
And I think-- I'm joking, kind of.


00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.560
But with all these changes so quickly,


00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.560
it starts to get, you've got to be on the right version of Python or this thing won't exist, right?


00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.480
And it's going to be an error.


00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.080
Yeah, it used to be, ah, last five versions is fine.


00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.600
Now it's like, last version is fine.


00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.320
We'll see.


00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.960
Yeah, that I'm starting to, I'm working with some, some educators.


00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.600
And one of the, the, the tricky things in like universities is the, is the, the, your, your


00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.800
curriculum is kind of needs to be known ahead of time and they kind of set that.


00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.600
And so with Python moving so fast, I wonder how educators are dealing with


00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:25.760
this, if they're, if they're teaching three eight or anyway, three 11.


00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.100
All right.


00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.080
We got some teachers in the audience saying three 11.


00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.680
Yeah.


00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.920
The kids, they like new shiny things anyway.


00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.880
I give them that, give them that.


00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.480
All right.


00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:32.800
All right.


00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.960
Well, what's next year, Brian?


00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.640
What's my next one?


00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.680
I don't know either.


00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.160
No, I do.


00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.280
It has to do with AI probably.


00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.580
All right, so this one comes to us from Matt Harrison,


00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.940
who's here at the conference, if you wanna say hi.


00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.500
And, will you switch me over to the streamer?


00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.300
- Is that one?


00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.300
- That one.


00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:55.300
And obviously, there's all this GPT stuff going crazy,


00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.940
but one of the challenges is you can ask it a question


00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.300
and it'll give you an answer, right?


00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.060
Like, hey, please write this code for me.


00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.700
And boom, here's, you don't need to hire anybody,


00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.780
just take this code and trust me.


00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.680
or whatever, right?


00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.840
You ask it a question and you can ask it


00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.560
a couple of questions, but it has what's called,


00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.520
was it a token stack or something like that?


00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.760
It only has so much memory of like the context


00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.320
of what you're asking it.


00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.120
And the ability to go and ask it to do one thing


00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.120
and then based on its response, go do another


00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.560
and then a third after that, it's not quite there yet.


00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.280
So there's this project called AutoGPT.


00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.280
So if you have a OpenAI API key, basically,


00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.940
So if you pay for open AI or somehow have access to it,


00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.460
then you can plug it into this thing.


00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.460
And what it does is you give it a mission.


00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.220
You say, dear AI thing,


00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.420
what I would like you to do is go search Google for this,


00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.020
figure out what you find,


00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.040
and then get the top three most popular ones,


00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.540
go find their webpages,


00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.220
take all the information out of that


00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.500
and summarize them for me.


00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.140
And then make a prediction about like,


00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.220
who's gonna win the Superbowl


00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.780
'cause I'm gonna bet big on it.


00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.620
I don't know.


00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.180
So basically, that's the idea.


00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.920
It says it has a couple of benefits over regular chat


00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.120
GTP, for example, which is you can't connect it


00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.780
to the internet.


00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.080
I don't know if you ever played with it,


00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.480
but it'll say things like, I only know up to 2021.


00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.320
Sorry.


00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.760
This one has internet access.


00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.920
It has long-term memory storage.


00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.920
It'll store in a database, so you can have it go on and on


00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.760
for a long time.


00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.800
File storage, all sorts of interesting things.


00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.160
So they have a video that we'll link in the show notes


00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.040
so you can check out here.


00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.860
I'm gonna mute it 'cause I don't wanna hear this person talk.


00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.980
But it says, fires it up and it says,


00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.000
all right, we're gonna get started.


00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.060
And what I want you to do,


00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.520
your role is an AI designed to teach me about AutoGPT,


00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.980
the thing that is itself, right?


00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.000
Very meta self-referential.


00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.980
Your goals as a list in Python is first search


00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.980
what AutoGPT is and then find the GitHub


00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.500
and figure out what it actually is from its GitHub project.


00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.920
then explain what it is and save your explanation


00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.280
to a file called auto GPT.txt and then stop.


00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.940
- Nice.


00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.420
- And it will, if you run it, you will say,


00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.100
okay, well now it's gone out to Google


00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.500
and it's done this thing and it's pulled it in


00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.460
and now it's starting to analyze it.


00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.380
And why is this interesting?


00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.580
This is all Python code.


00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.760
Right, so this thing is created in Python,


00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.320
you run it with Python.


00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.360
I'm sure you can extend it in different ways with Python,


00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.160
but yeah, it's pretty nuts.


00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.560
you create these little things, you put them on a mission,


00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.400
and you just say, go get me tickets for this concert,


00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.600
or go do this other thing,


00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.040
and here's the plan I want you to follow,


00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.360
and you just set it loose.


00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.920
So anyway, if you wanna combine some Python


00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.480
and some automating of the large language models,


00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.440
there you go.


00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.200
- This seems like something could definitely


00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.600
easily be used for evil.


00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.340
- Oh, no way, there's no way.


00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.000
(laughing)


00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.840
Yeah, I agree.


00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.680
- All right.


00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.680
- All right.


00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.020
What do you got for the last one?


00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:06.860
- Okay.


00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:12.000
So we've talked about Ruff before, I think.


00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.600
So there's been an announcement


00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.320
that Charlie Marsh is now his own company


00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.960
and hiring people.


00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.720
So Charlie Marsh has formed a company called Astral


00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.560
and he's made a good start.


00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.720
He's starting with $4 million of investment money.


00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.720
So it's not a bad deal to start a company.


00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.440
But I'm kind of excited about it actually.


00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.480
I think I, well, one, I'm happy for him.


00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.720
Obviously, well, at least I hope it's a good thing for him.


00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.480
But the, but it's kind of, I just think it's neat that,


00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.520
I guess I just wanted to highlight and say congrats,


00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.040
Charlie, you're doing this.


00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.920
But so the rough, if you're not familiar,


00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.960
is a, it's kind of like a flake eight winter sort of thing,


00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.760
But it's written in Rust and it's really, really fast.


00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.800
It's so fast, you can barely detect it's running.


00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.720
But it works.


00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.280
- Yeah, how many of you all have heard of Ruff?


00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.480
R-U-F-F?


00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.320
Pretty much everyone.


00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.880
And this thing's only been out like a year,


00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.880
so that's a big deal.


00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.080
Yeah, I ran it on the Python bytes


00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.240
and the talk Python code,


00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.080
and 20,000 lines of Python.


00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.040
And you're like, did it actually run?


00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.260
Did I give it the wrong files?


00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.680
It might not have seen anything.


00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.880
It's crazy.


00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.320
- One of the things Chloe's noticed


00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.280
is that it's becoming very popular,


00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.840
but he's also getting a lot of requests.


00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.120
So it's a very active project now,


00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.980
and I'm sure it's taking a lot of time.


00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.720
So he's got things like new requests.


00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.040
Let's do more of the extensions of Flake 8,


00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.380
which completely valid.


00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.300
And then also, yeah, well, this was a good idea


00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.620
of taking part of the Python tool chain


00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.720
and rewriting it in Rust,


00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.920
what other stuff could we rewrite in Rust?


00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.740
And I think that's where they're headed


00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.920
is making like more Python things more rough like


00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.260
or, you know, rustifying them.


00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.180
So I'm excited for it and to see what they come up with.


00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.620
And he's promising that a lot of this stuff


00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.460
is going to be open source available to everybody, so.


00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.300
- Awesome.


00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.700
Congratulations, Charlie.


00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.740
That's awesome.


00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.740
I would say, when I got into Python nine, 10 years ago,


00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.060
there seemed to be this really strong resistance


00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.100
to anything corporate,


00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.060
anything like people were trying to bring money.


00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.100
It seemed really suspicious.


00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.820
Like, what is your motive here?


00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.260
Are you trying to corrupt our open source environment?


00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.900
And I think since then, we've kind of found a way


00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.300
where there can be commercial interests


00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.420
that don't undermine the community,


00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.220
but also come in and benefit.


00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:58.020
I mean, we saw Samuel Colvin with Pydantic.


00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.460
We're seeing this now.


00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.180
And a lot of them seem to fall--


00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.020
- In textuals.


00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.840
- In textual, absolutely.


00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.540
Rich McGoogan, with Rich, sorry, Will.


00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.260
And a lot of them seem to fall under this,


00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.700
what's called open core business model,


00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.540
where the essence of what they're doing,


00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:19.260
they give away for free, like Rich, like Pydantic.


00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.300
But then on top of that, there's something


00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.180
that is highly polished and commercial,


00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.700
and that's where they're kind of working.


00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.580
And I personally am just really happy for these folks


00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.540
that this is happening.


00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.540
I think it creates more opportunity.


00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.420
It creates more opportunity for people in Python.


00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.340
People who have worked on these projects for so long


00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.140
get a lot of, it kind of pays off eventually, right?


00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.340
The PayPal donate button, there's no way that that's a job.


00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.500
That's like a, it covered my dinner once a month


00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.660
sort of thing. - Yeah.


00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.940
I also get that there's a lot of people that can't do this. I mean, there's a,


00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.500
there's a lot of things that people are happy with their normal job and,


00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.540
and, but they're doing something cool on the side. I,


00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.060
we still need to figure out how to compensate those people. Yeah.


00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.260
Yeah. We'll figure that.


00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.500
One of the things I wanted to bring up is I was talking about this announcement


00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.060
with somebody just yesterday and they said, Oh rough.


00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.500
it's kind of like black, right? Like, wait, I don't think it's quite,


00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.820
That's quite right.


00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.500
I think of it more like Flake 8,


00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.240
but I was curious about the overlap.


00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.700
So I went up and looked in the FAQ


00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.700
and the top question is, is Ruff compatible with Black?


00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.540
So yes, it says Ruff is compatible with Black out of the box


00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.140
as long as the line length setting


00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.580
is consistent between the two,


00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.120
because Black has a weird line length thing.


00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.300
I've had no problem with running them together.


00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.580
And I was like, also, should I run them together?


00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.740
And right in here, it says,


00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.620
"Rough is designed to be used alongside black,


00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.620
"and as such, will defer implementing stylistic lint rules


00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.440
"that are obviated by auto-formatting."


00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.060
So what does that mean?


00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.580
It means that there's no point,


00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.700
they're assuming that you're running black.


00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.780
So if running black will do something,


00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.540
there's no point in rough checking it


00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.760
because they know that you've already done it


00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.600
or something.


00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.740
They're gonna...


00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.460
- Yeah, don't let them fight.


00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.300
- Yeah.


00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.500
- Wrap this line, unwrap that line, wrap that line,


00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.340
unwrap that line.


00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.540
- Well that, and also like,


00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.720
that's not their highest priority of fixing,


00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.540
of checking for lint errors


00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.300
that black would have changed anyway.


00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.820
So. - Yeah.


00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.660
- Indeed.


00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.820
All right, well, congrats.


00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.660
That's very cool.


00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.380
I think that might be it for our items, huh?


00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.220
What do you think?


00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.580
- Oh yeah, for our main items.


00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.420
- Our main items.


00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.240
You got some extras?


00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.120
- I do have one extra.


00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.120
The one extra is on the Fikart, what's Matthew?


00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.600
- Matthew Fikart.


00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.600
- Okay. - Yes.


00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.720
- Wanted us to bring up, which sorry, Matthew,


00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.040
for me forgetting your name right away.


00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.520
- Former Python Bytes co-host, guest, attendee.


00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.320
- Yeah, so I wanted to announce


00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.960
that the tickets are available.


00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.680
It's now open, you can buy tickets to SciPy 2023.


00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.480
And SciPy 2023 is in Austin, Texas


00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.780
in July, on July 10th through the 16th.


00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.580
So that's open, if anybody wants to go, should be fun.


00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.820
- Yeah, anyone going to Austin to go to SciPy?


00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.220
I know you've all used up your conference going.


00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.660
- There's a maybe. - Some maybe's out there.


00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.260
I mean, Austin would be great to visit.


00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.220
SciPy will give you a different flavor of Python.


00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.580
I think it'd be great, but.


00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.220
- Yeah.


00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.900
- I can't make it, I'm coming home from vacation


00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.340
on the 10th or something like that,


00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.900
which makes it a little tight


00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.300
to get all the way to Austin.


00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.660
- Yeah.


00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.660
All right, do you have any extra?


00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.340
- I have one extra, nothing major,


00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.020
kind of a follow up here.


00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:52.100
The mobile app, I talked about that,


00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.220
the mobile app is officially out for Talk by Then courses


00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.060
and I would like people to try it out.


00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.060
If they find a bug, just shoot me an email


00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.340
rather than write a one star review and trash it


00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.020
'cause we're working really hard to get it complete.


00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.460
It's been two and a half months of being working on it.


00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.940
It's completely redone from scratch.


00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:15.620
It's very nice, but it needs a little testing


00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.200
across all the zillions of devices.


00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.180
Android is out.


00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.940
You noticed, Brian, I did not say the Apple version is out,


00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.780
did I?


00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.600
- No.


00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.440
- Oh no, no, no, no, no.


00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.880
'Cause when you submit something to Apple,


00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.700
what they tell you is rejected, rejected.


00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.500
Your app does not do X, Y, and Z, and it's gotta,


00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.300
and Android's like, yeah, sure, that's good.


00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.620
So we're now adding in-app purchasing


00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.660
because without it, you can't have your app.


00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.060
So I'm gonna work on that for the next week


00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.660
and then we'll have an Apple version y'all can test


00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.940
and it will be out but it's just not out yet.


00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.700
- What are you gonna sell for in-app purchases?


00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.180
- Courses.


00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.860
I actually wrote some of them.


00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.180
You know, I might even sell one of yours.


00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.020
- Yeah, the pytest course.


00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.840
- Yes, exactly.


00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.620
- Nice.


00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.500
- Awesome, anyway, that's my extra.


00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.700
- What's Android, by the way?


00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.300
- Yeah, it's...


00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.300
- No, just kidding.


00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.580
Let's not go there.


00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.820
All right.


00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:14.100
So this one, I'm gonna take a chance.


00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.220
I'm gonna take a risk here and turn my screen around


00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.380
for everyone because this joke is very visual.


00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.700
You'll be able to see it over there.


00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.300
- And you can see mine.


00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.460
You know it already.


00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.500
- All right, so let's see.


00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.540
How can I make this?


00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.260
So what was this?


00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.580
Here, folks, let me get this set up.


00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.420
One second.


00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:44.160
So this is what it's like releasing new production. We've got the senior dev and we've got the


00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:50.640
junior dev. Here we go. What happened? It scrolled. That's not what it's supposed to


00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.440
here we go. Here we go.


00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.080
What is this? Mr. Bean? Yeah. Mr. Bean.


00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:06.320
It's just people are rocking all over. The junior dev is hanging on for life.


00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.880
There's like a molten lava here in a second. That's the database.


00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.960
Some of the developers are thrown into the lava. It's just, there you go.


00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.000
The scrum masher was thrown into the lava, which is the database.


00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.040
Anyway, what do you all think? You ever felt that way?


00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.600
No, I definitely throw the Scrum Master into the well.


00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.080
Yeah, definitely. Definitely. But anyway, that's what I brought for our joke.


00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.280
Nice. I like it.


00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.560
And I also took you off the camera. There you go.


00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.080
That's all right. Well, this was fun doing a live episode.


00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.120
It was very fun. And thank you all for being here. This is really awesome.


00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.920
Yeah. Thanks, everybody. And thank you, everybody online for watching and showing up.


00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.880
Yeah, absolutely. Bye, y'all.


00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.220
