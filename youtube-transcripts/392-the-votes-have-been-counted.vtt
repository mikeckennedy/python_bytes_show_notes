00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.760
>> Hey, what's up, Brian?

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.960
>> Hey, good to see you.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.000
>> Yeah, good to see you as well.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.400
Thanks to everyone who's joining us live at a slightly different time.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.000
And if you're re-watching the live recording,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.520
well, it's whenever you re-watch it,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.240
but thanks for doing it nonetheless.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.280
>> Yeah. I had Dirty Duty yesterday, so that's what happens.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.080
>> Yeah. That would have been interesting,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.120
but not as interesting as Python Bytes.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.200
>> No. They wouldn't let me record from the courthouse.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.240
>> That is weak. We're going to live stream this. Come on now.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.800
All right. Let's kick it off.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.640
>> Okay.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.920
>> Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.760
where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.120
This is episode 392,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.240
recorded July 17th, 2024. I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.840
>> And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.240
>> This episode is brought to you by Code Comments,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.640
an original podcast from Red Hat.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.160
So thank you to Red Hat for supporting the show.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.480
We'll tell you more about them later.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.360
You can follow us on Fosted On.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.320
The links for Brian, me,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.360
and the show are all in the show notes.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.600
And you can also follow us on X if you wish.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.200
I know some people have not yet made the transition.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.520
What are you waiting for people? Come on.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.960
And finally, before we jump into it,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.640
we are super excited that people are signing up for the newsletter.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.680
Check that out.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.120
Just go to pythonbytes.fm,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.840
click on the big newsletter button in the middle,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.120
put your e-mail in, you'll hear about cool stuff.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.960
You'll get the show notes, but you'll also get

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.160
announcements that we might send out and other things,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.480
live events, who knows.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.640
So sign up, be in the know,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.800
and we'd love to talk to you there, and we won't share.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.480
Brian.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.760
>> And we were going to do a contest or something.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.160
>> Oh, yes, we're going to do a contest.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.120
The numbers are growing and we reached a monumental number.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.160
I'm pulling up my list monk management here.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.480
Oh, we are close.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.360
We're getting quite close here.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.640
So yeah, we're going to do some kind of contest.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.960
Yeah, some kind of giveaways.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.200
We'll see what that is.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.800
>> Cool. All right.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.160
So let's kick it off.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.040
Let's start with something exciting,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.760
the 2024 PSF board election and by-law election.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.600
The election happened and the results are in already.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.680
So it happened pretty quick.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.480
And nobody's demanded a recount yet, so that's good.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.080
We don't do that in the PSF.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.400
But so new board members,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.800
Tanya Allard, Quan Hei Bay,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.000
and Christian Moriera-Freides, I think.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.520
But congrats to the three new board members.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.640
Super awesome. Should be fun for you.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.120
One of the things in this announcement was that the, where was it?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.360
Basically, it says, what's next?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.000
If there's four, here it is at the bottom.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.720
There's four seats open again next year.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.960
So might feel early,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.720
but if you're thinking about running for the board,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.280
it might not be early to think about it now,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.600
to get ready and think about what you wanted to propose and stuff.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.920
So, and they suggest reaching out to one or two current board members

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.400
to ask them about their experience before throwing your hat in the ring.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.880
So it actually sounds pretty interesting.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.880
So anyway, so the three new board members, congrats.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.440
And then also all of the PSF by-law changes passed heartily,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.000
like with a big margin.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.160
So let's take a look at that a little bit.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.760
So, oh, let's look at what they are again.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.960
So there were merging, contributing, and managing member classes.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.760
That seems like a no-brainer.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.840
I'm glad they're doing that.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.360
Simplifying the voter affirmation process

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.440
by treating past voting activity as intent to continue voting.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.520
That makes sense.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.360
- Yeah, I like that one.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.880
'Cause in order to vote,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.640
you have to attest that you're interested in voting for some reason now,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.240
which is funky, so.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.080
- Well, also, I mean, it makes sense for counting it.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.440
Like, if we just send it to everybody and just, what,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.000
give them three weeks to vote.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.920
I mean, how long do you have to wait?

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.120
I don't know, it's all right.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.840
Now, if you voted this year,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.160
you'll automatically be able to vote next year.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.800
That makes sense.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.880
And then the third one of allowing for removal of fellows

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.320
by a board vote in response to Code of Colorado Deck violations.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.880
That was, there was a lot of controversy on the chat and stuff

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.400
and in the mailing list.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.120
However, that third one and all of them,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.840
so the third one passed by a huge margin.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.320
Second one, also huge margin.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.200
First, huge margin.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.040
So it's, you know, smaller margin for three,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.800
but basically still most people are for it.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.680
And I was for it too.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.520
And I trust our board, so I think it's a good thing.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.040
So if you want to read more about all of these,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.200
there's a link to all the different bylaw changes.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.920
So you can read more about them if you want to.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.760
- Yeah, cool.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.800
Very cool.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.200
Hey, I do have a quick comment here.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.040
- Okay.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.040
- These, the number of people who voted are in the hundreds,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.160
like 300, 400, something like that.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.800
There are millions of Python developers,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.400
literally millions.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.720
There's plenty, tens of thousands of people

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.320
who just listened to this podcast

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.000
who are in the know and interested enough.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.040
Vote, guys and girls.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.320
- Yeah, yeah, be part of the community by voting.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.240
It's a good way to have your voice heard.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.760
I also really enjoyed this year,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.240
and I do this every year,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.480
of actually reading about the different,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.040
reading all the different board candidates

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.880
and what they've done.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.680
It's kind of a neat way just to like catch up

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.280
on some people and what their contributions to Python are.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.320
So.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.240
- Catch a little zeitgeist.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.520
Where's the whole community going in a sense.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.720
- But not as much as if you listen to Python Bytes every week

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.800
'cause then it's like a rapids of zeitgeist.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.080
You can barely stand it.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.880
Speaking of barely standing it,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.880
imagine if you were on Saturn doing data science.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.840
- Oh.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.160
- Okay, so we obviously know about Jupyter,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.480
which is our biggest planet, clearly.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.640
But Saturn is pretty big too,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.000
and it's got cooler rings than Jupyter.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.560
So, better for data science?

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.400
I don't know.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.520
Okay, seriously, this is Saturn,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.520
and it's a modern Jupyter desktop application for macOS.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.320
- Cool.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.160
- It's pretty cool.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.120
So it's like super minimal.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.040
It has a bit of a, not a JupyterLab.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.040
That's too close to the real Jupyter,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.040
but just the Jupyter notebook style,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.040
like straightforward.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.800
It's supposed to be real minimalist, right?

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.760
It's nice and clean.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.280
It has a command palette,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.560
so you can, you know, Command + K or Command + Shift + P,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.640
whatever the hot key is, I don't know yet.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.600
I haven't tried it.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.200
So you just download it and you get going.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.560
I think it might come bundled with Python,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.200
and you don't have to set up virtual environments and stuff,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.200
but you can connect it to so-called kernels

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.760
or basically virtual environments

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.040
that you would like there.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.880
All right?

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.520
So, very nice.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.920
You just download it and get started.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.440
It has a built-in LLM,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.440
so you can ask it LLM things like,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.040
describe the plot above and then plot it using,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.160
or describe the data above and plot it using lines

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.000
and scatter, and boom, it'll go and do that sort of thing.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.760
Pretty cool.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.400
It's very minimalist.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.720
If, like I said, if that's your vibe,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.560
and then this is it,

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.200
there's a command palette you can use.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.040
I don't know what the hot key is, and again,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.440
comes with black built-in,

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.720
so you get automatic formatting.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.760
Just press F, apparently, and boom,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.560
your whole notebook is formatted, which is really nice.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.800
I feel like that's one of the things

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.000
kind of missing from notebooks,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.360
is like a real nice,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.040
just sort of management of code in general,

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.240
like the autocomplete is not that great.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.560
I know you can hit, there's like,

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.440
you can press some hot keys to trigger autocomplete,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.120
but it just doesn't happen as you type like many editors.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.360
You can also do cool things like copy,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.400
just go to a graph copy and just paste it straight into,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.160
it's got a little copy button for the data tables

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.280
and for the graphs and things like that.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.560
Yeah, so all super neat.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.080
Check it out, and my final thought here

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.440
is download the alpha.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.720
There's no link to GitHub,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.360
so presumably this is not an open source thing,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.280
although perhaps it is, I just haven't found it,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.280
but there's no link to GitHub,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.120
and there's no business model expressed here.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.720
So will this be a paid product?

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.240
Is it just not yet out on GitHub?

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.280
You know what I mean?

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.720
I don't know.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.400
So buyer beware, and by buyer,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.320
I mean person who downloads for free.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.400
- Yeah.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.600
- But it looks really promising to me.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.400
I really like the vibe here.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.000
- Oh, okay, go up, oh, this is the rough thing.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.840
Let's see.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.480
- We do have a blog.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.520
You can check it out, but it has literally one entry

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.920
that says integrating the rough language server,

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.880
which is like an engineering cool, that's fun,

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.760
but it doesn't tell you anything about it.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.800
- Oh, okay.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.120
- It doesn't add any information

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.920
to what I was just talking about, you know what I mean?

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.520
- Yeah, and it doesn't have the Saturn.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.880
It has a link to an editor, one repo,

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.680
but it isn't the Saturn repo.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.760
- We'll see, but look, if somebody makes something

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.680
that you pay money for,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.480
that's a super nice data science app,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.440
and it's not out of control,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.600
I'm not saying that's a negative thing.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.920
I'm just saying it's not clear what its status is.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.600
- Yeah, but also if anybody that's part of this,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.560
like Jack Hodkinson or anybody else on Saturn team,

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.320
let us know what's going on.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.320
- Shoot us an email.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.760
- Speaking of stuff we wanna let people know about,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.000
I bet there's some code comments

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.560
in this Saturn code there, what do you think?

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.000
- I think probably.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.840
- Probably.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.000
This episode is brought to you by Code Comments,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.320
an original podcast from Red Hat.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.840
You know when you're working on a project

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.960
and you leave behind a small comment in the code?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.760
Maybe you're hoping to help others learn

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.480
what isn't clear at first.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.080
Sometimes that code comment tells a story

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.760
of a challenging journey

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.600
to the current state of the project.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.640
Code Comments, the podcast, features technologists

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.400
who've been through tough tech transitions

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.160
and they share how their teams survived that journey.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.120
The host, Jamie Parker, is a Red Hatter

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.680
and an experienced engineer.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.920
In each episode, Jamie recounts the stories

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.400
of technologists from across the industry

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.800
who've been on a journey implementing new technologies.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.920
I recently listened to an episode about DevOps

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.720
from the folks at Worldwide Technology.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.600
The hardest challenge turned out to be getting buy-in

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.760
on the new tech stack

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.440
rather than using that tech stack directly.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.360
It's a message that we can all relate to

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.760
and I'm sure you can take some hard-won lessons

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.200
back to your own team.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.040
Give Code Comments a listen.

The link is in your podcast player's show notes.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.800
Thank you to Code Comments for supporting the show.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.880
Indeed, indeed.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.040
Now, back over to you.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.360
- I wanna talk about something bad that happened on PyPI,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.840
but it's not, it could have been worse,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.840
but it's not, but it could have been,

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.080
but it wasn't bad.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.160
Anyway, what happened was,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.480
and I'm gonna link to a couple blog posts.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.480
One of them is on the pypi.org blog

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.720
from E. Durbin.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.920
Incident report leaked GitHub personal access token.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.320
So what happened was,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.320
and E just go ahead and writes out the timeline of events.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.280
It was something that he was working on,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.560
something called Cabotage.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.400
And the gist of it is,

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.240
he was trying to debug something

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.280
and ran into some problems with timeouts

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.320
for GitHub access tokens for the generic ones

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.200
or the community ones or whatever.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.600
And so he used his own personal one for a while

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.240
while he was developing it, then he switched back.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.840
But his personal access token got saved into a PYC file

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.880
that made it to a Docker image that got published.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.880
So this is bad because it would have given access

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.900
to a whole bunch of PyPI and core stuff, including Python.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.840
Probably not good.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.720
So what happened, how this was found though,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.720
was JFrog does a regular binary scan

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.240
of a lot of packages or open source projects

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.520
that we rely on, including Python and stuff.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.520
And they found this problem

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.320
and they notified the security team on PyPI.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.160
And the token, the security team from PyPI

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.660
revoked the token within 17 minutes of getting notified.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.920
This is like amazingly, blazingly fast, I think.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.920
And JFrog even points this out,

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.000
that this is, we had done a research team,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.960
identified it, reported to PyPI,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.400
and it was revoked in a mere 17 minutes,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.720
which is super cool.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.040
Anyway, so it was revoked, it was fixed.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.280
And then afterwards a scan was done to find out

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.280
if that access token was used for anything, and it wasn't.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.000
So it wasn't exploited at all.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.740
But there are some good takeaways that,

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:53.040
and there's in the original blog post

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.040
to just talk about a little bit more about the details

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.560
about how this showed up in the Docker file.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.600
But the takeaways are a few of them.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.320
It, there's three of them.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.440
First, set aggressive expiration dates for API tokens.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.680
So if you are gonna use an API token,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.360
have only have it for as long as you need it

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.180
and have it, you know, consider the timeout

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.820
because if it escapes, you have to deal with that.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.640
Also treat PYC files as if they were source code.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.100
So, and that's, I don't, you know,

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.280
normally I don't think about that

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.040
'cause we don't publish PYC files,

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.840
but if they're in the Docker image,

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.240
it's gonna get published, right?

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.560
So the other way was, the other note was

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.440
only release builds from automated systems on,

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:49.440
like use a CI system with a clean source only.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.520
So some great reminders that PYC files

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.960
are really something to be careful about also

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.720
and be very careful with access tokens.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.700
- Yeah, pretty scary.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.940
Pretty scary.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.020
The TechRadar folks, TechRadar is,

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.080
thinking of the right place, I really like their writing.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.380
They phrase it as, "A GitHub token leak

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.040
"could have put the entire Python language at risk.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.600
"What if Python itself was malicious?"

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.040
Right, because I mean, it gave anyone

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.880
who wanted to get a hold of that right access

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.200
to the Python, CPython repo and other parts of deployment,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.400
it's not ideal.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.320
- Yeah.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.720
- But it sounds like it was caught, so it's really good.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.040
- Could have been very bad.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.160
- Yes, another bullet dodged, another bullet dodged.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.040
- But both posts are interesting reads.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.220
The JFrog one also has quite a bit of good information

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.080
about how to protect from this

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.760
and some of the actions,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.840
some of the new GitHub access tokens have a way,

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.440
they're easier to scan than they used to be able.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.000
They're easier to find because there's a prefix

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.120
that you can scan for within binary, so that's pretty cool.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.160
- Oh, right, right, right.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.640
Yeah, they've changed that format.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.000
That's good.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.640
I was listening to Steve Gibson recently,

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.160
the security guy, and he talks about how

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.240
these things are scary, but made an analogy

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.920
to earthquakes and fault lines.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.160
And if there's never any little tiny earthquake,

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.400
there's no release of pressure.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.640
And eventually that comes out

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.960
and some huge terrible thing,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.200
we've all learned a lesson,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.600
and this is less likely to happen,

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.880
and we dodge the bullet.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.680
So it's bad, but it also has a silver lining in that

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.400
here's one fear away is that things are gonna get out,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.000
that at least people are running Python,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.800
and probably others will learn from as well.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.640
- Yeah.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.240
- All right, I would like to go

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.640
on a bit of an extra, extra, extra.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.680
This was not the intention.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.720
I had some other topic, and I'm like,

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.920
and another extra, another extra.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.880
I'm like, all right, this is out of control.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.720
So you ready?

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.280
Extra, extra, extra, hear all about it?

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.200
- Yeah, I'm ready.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.800
- All right, let's do it.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.240
Number one, first extra, pretty quick here is

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.240
Python 3.13 Beta 3 has been released.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.520
This was a couple days ago.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.960
It's not like, why would you put the date at the bottom?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.880
I don't know.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.840
Anyway, I know it's at the top, June 27th.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.480
So it's actually been a little bit of time,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.800
but there's no other beta,

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.360
and people should be checking out.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.800
This is the third of four beta releases.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.920
So this is basically the last chance

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.560
to make potential changes before it's

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.160
completely just down to bug fixes, right?

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.160
- Okay, yeah.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.000
- Okay, so the Python folks strongly encourage

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.080
maintainers of third-party Python packages

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.200
to test with 3.13 during the beta phase

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.080
and report any found issues to the Python bug tracker ASAP.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.640
It will be feature complete while the release

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.040
is planned to be feature complete

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.400
entering the beta phase as possible to get modified

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.240
or changed based on how serious any problems might be.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.920
Anyway, 3.13 Beta 3, awesome.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.840
Minibar Ice, I told you guys about this

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.600
when there was the bartender.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.480
I was such a fan of bartender, recommend it everywhere.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.200
And then bartender went a little funky.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.600
It's not that it was sold to someone else that's a problem,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.800
it's that it was sold and the fact that it was sold

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.440
was obscured, that's the problem, right?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.480
Talked about that previously.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.920
So I switched to Ice and Ice was like,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.800
it kind of does the thing that bartender used to,

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.160
but it's get hides menu,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.320
like it doesn't seem to show everything reliably.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.440
And anyway, it was really kind of janky,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.200
but this thing I think got a ton of attention

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.040
since all that happened.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.520
It's got a lot of contributions.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.840
So new release, a lot of bug fixes,

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.960
primarily like a cool little dropdown

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.560
that shows all your stuff in a second.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.040
If you click on it, it'll show you a little second window.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.880
Really nice.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.200
So I can more strongly recommend open source free Ice

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.320
than before, links in the show notes.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.160
- You got a lot of stuff up there, man.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.160
- That's why I need this thing.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.960
It's out of control, man.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.200
I'm telling you, it's a problem.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.120
All right, last time you mentioned the article,

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.320
I will pile drive you if you say AI again,

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.120
and it resonated strongly with me.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.080
All right.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.120
- Yeah.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.120
- So the Primagen guy did a one hour prime reacts

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:36.520
to the I will pile drive you article and it is gold.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.320
So check out this if you just want to like sit back

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.960
and listen to it in the background.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.000
This is a really good video.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.240
It's worth your hour of time.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.440
So check that out.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.480
- I listened to an interview.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.280
I don't have the link right off the bat,

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.880
but I listened to a podcast episode

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.960
of somebody interviewing the guy also.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.800
- Okay.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.640
Interesting.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.480
- I'll drop a link in the show notes.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.680
- Yeah, he does a good stream sort of thing.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.440
All right, next up, we talked about Polyfill,

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.280
I think a couple of episodes ago.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.240
Right, Polyfill IO and all that.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.840
So Polyfill was, Polyfill.io used to be run

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.680
by some financial publication.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.600
I can't remember exactly.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.240
I don't want to misattribute them.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.200
And then they were sold.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.720
They were like a CDN for JavaScript stuff.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.400
And they were sold to a Chinese company,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.320
which in itself is not necessarily bad.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.160
But then the Chinese company started sending malicious code

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.360
instead of regular JSON polyfills to its users.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.320
But in a super select way, like,

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.880
oh, are you doing an authentication

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.200
at this third party identity as a service thing?

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.280
Well, maybe now you're getting the bad JavaScript

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.960
or whatever, you know?

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.320
So really, really tricky stuff.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.320
And the Polyfill.io domain was not unregistered.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.360
It was basically blocked by its registrar,

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.840
which I think was name cheap.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.120
But there are four other domains that it turns out

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.920
that they're also using as CDNs.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.120
I don't know what happened to them.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.600
Maybe they've been dealt with by now, but maybe not.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.360
But also what if Polyfill.io just re-registers

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.280
somewhere else eventually?

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.120
Is this possible?

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.120
I don't actually know.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.840
So I posted a thing on,

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.840
posted on in on Twitter saying,

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.320
hey, if you have some kind of fancy DNS,

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.680
you might want to put blocks in for all these domains.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.800
So staticfile.org, staticfile.net, bootcss.com,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.160
bootcdn.net, and polyfill.io.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.520
Those are all blocked in my next DNS, which is awesome,

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.600
which is like a pie hole,

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.200
but you get access to it anywhere,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.360
not just while you're at your house,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.000
which is better, I think.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.160
- Cool.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.160
- Yeah, so if you care about that stuff,

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.120
this is one way to say you can now surf the web.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.240
And even if you go to a vulnerable website,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.920
it won't load these things.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.080
So that's always good.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.000
- All right, nice.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.520
- Next up, we have the JetBrains

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.600
Developer Ecosystem Survey 2024.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.560
The survey is now open.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.160
It's pretty intense, takes like 25 minutes,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.760
but you can, if you want to complete it,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.480
contribute to sort of, you know,

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.200
what editor is popular, what frameworks are you using,

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.760
do you like databases, et cetera.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.960
For this, you may win a MacBook Pro 16,

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.320
an NVIDIA GeForce, some phones, and so on and so on,

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.440
a bunch of stuff you can win, potentially.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.520
Coding the Castle in October,

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.840
October 5 to 12th in Tuscany,

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.240
still has some seats open,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.080
so check that out at hawkpython.fm/castle.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.640
And if you're interested,

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.600
a week of half Python learning, half excursions in Tuscany.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.000
So check that out as well.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.560
And that concludes my extra, extra, extra,

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.680
hear all about it.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.520
- So do you need somebody to help,

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.480
like, you know, carry your equipment?

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.200
- Yeah, sure, I mean, I'm gonna bring a MacBook Air,

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.880
so that is pretty heavy.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.960
Would you like to help?

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.080
- Yeah, yeah, if you want to pay for my trip,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.280
I would definitely help you out.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.320
- Yeah, yeah, awesome, I appreciate that.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.160
(laughing)

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.160
- No, it looks like fun.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.080
I'm excited to hear about that when you get back.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.680
- Yeah, I am too.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.760
I think I'll give it to you in a couple days

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.680
in motorcycle riding,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.120
there's like some off-road enduro tours you can do there,

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.520
like, it's pretty close, if I can link those together.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.960
Then I'll need help carrying, like,

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.960
all the motorcycle gear that will, like,

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.800
mount that way up. - Are you gonna try

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.760
to check your motorcycle as a--

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.960
- No, you can rent motorcycles there.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.800
You gotta check it.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.240
(laughing)

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.680
- I'll just ship it ahead, it'll be there waiting for me.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.600
- Yeah.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.920
- Awesome, how about your extras, got anything?

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.240
- Yeah, so I wanted to, let's see.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.160
I'm working on a new pytest course.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.520
So already on Talk Python training,

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.920
there is the Getting Started with pytest course.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.080
It is three and a half hours long,

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.760
so it's pretty quick,

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.920
covers a lot of the basics of pytest.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.600
I also have the complete pytest course

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.880
over on courses.pythontest.com.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.000
This little, I mean, the 162 lessons might freak people out,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.360
but a lot of the lessons,

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.040
it's basically the entire Python testing with pytest book,

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.680
and a lot of the videos are chopped up

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.920
into, like, three minutes, four minutes, so--

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.120
- As they should be.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.800
- Yeah, so, but I do notice that there's a gap.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.520
So the new course I'm working on

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.360
is a really introduction to pytest,

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.160
introduction to testing concepts.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.640
And this is, and I really want it to be something

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.040
that somebody could really watch in half a day easy,

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.040
or even just a little bit.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.680
And I'm targeting, I'm hoping to be under an hour

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.520
to introduce a lot of these great concepts.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.320
And this would be intended for people, for the entire team.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.900
Like, my idea would be everybody on the team,

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.600
including the manager, would take this little mini course,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.680
and then you'd have a couple experts,

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.600
couple people that wanna be the pytest experts

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.760
take the complete course or something,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.360
or the one on Tucked Python Training,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.240
to be more in depth.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.120
And so that, I think there's a gap there

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.520
for the little, the quick intro, so I'm working on that.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.640
- Awesome, that'll be fun.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.480
I agree with you, by the way.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.240
I do think there's probably a good gap there as well.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.320
- Yeah, also, and I'm kinda wanting that for my internal,

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.040
for my own company of, like,

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.640
I don't think I can tell people

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.280
to go watch an eight hour video.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.400
I don't remember if it's eight hours or not,

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.880
but it's, well, also, okay,

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.760
I wanna have people not freak out too much.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.320
It's split into three parts, and you really,

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.560
the intent of the entire book wasn't to read everything.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.200
It's to read the first part,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.320
and then use the rest of it as resources as necessary.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.880
So, same with the course.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.320
Okay, I've got other stuff going on too.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.260
I've got a couple of these other couple podcasts,

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.600
Python People, I thought it was a great idea,

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.080
but I just haven't had time.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.940
So, it hasn't been updated since May.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.360
I'm just gonna officially say

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.440
it's kind of indefinitely on hold.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.360
I don't know what's gonna happen with it,

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.000
but I'm not working on it.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.020
- Okay.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.080
- And Python Test, it was testing code,

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.280
and it's still like this,

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.920
still the little icon is still testing code.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.920
And now it's Python Test for 14 episodes, 14 out of 221.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.500
I am gonna flip flop and probably switch back

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.540
to testing code, because there's a series I wanna do

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.820
about test-driven development, and it's really,

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.060
it's not, it's language agnostic,

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.340
so it doesn't really make sense

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.900
to have it be under the Python banner.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.420
And I probably, I can't,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.740
I wanna say I promise to not switch it again,

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.360
but, you know, who knows?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.460
It's whatever.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.740
So, that's, those are my extras.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.580
I'll probably get back to record,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.160
I'm still roughing out the ideas for the series,

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.840
it'll probably come out in August or September, so.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.680
- Excellent.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.860
- Those are my extras. - Well, I look forward to it.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.700
Very cool.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.620
- But that wasn't very funny, though.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.380
- No, it was not, it was not.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.660
Good thing about podcasts, if people subscribe to them,

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.820
and a year later, you're like,

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.340
all right, I'm ready for more Python people,

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.540
it'll just start showing up in their players again.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.060
- Yeah, and I'll talk, you know, follow Python Bytes.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.680
We're not gonna stop Python Bytes anytime.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.340
- Well, there's no plan on it, so.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.540
- There's definitely no plan on it.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.980
All right, let's get something a little bit funny.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.500
Now, I know there's been a lot of talk about AI,

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.500
although I'm frightened of being pile-derived.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.420
I don't know if people know this wrestling term,

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.380
but it's disturbing.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.900
Anyway, I'm a little worried about it,

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.620
but this is not helping you code with AI.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.380
This is just straight-up editor help

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.300
that I also consider super important.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.900
It's entitled, "I Need My IntelliSense."

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.700
Are you a fan of Scooby-Doo, Brian?

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.580
- Yeah.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.540
- Did you watch Scooby-Doo, the cartoon, growing up?

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.780
So here's, what's the woman's name with reddish hair?

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.620
- Did I?

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.460
I still catch up.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.660
I still keep up on all the Scooby-Doos.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.140
- Awesome.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.780
So she has glasses, and she lost them, obviously,

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.060
like the picture.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.220
I've lost my glasses in this scary house or whatever,

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.860
but the caption is, "My IntelliSense!

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.100
I can't code without my IntelliSense!"

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.340
Oh, I relate.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.860
(both laughing)

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.660
That's pretty funny, yeah.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.820
- Yeah, anyway, I thought that would resonate

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.100
with some folks out there.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.060
- Would I have to actually look up what the parameters are?

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.100
That's just barbaric.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.700
- It's totally barbaric, and it's a segment of your mind

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.060
that doesn't need to be filled with those details.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.900
You just type and let it flow.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.700
- One of the things, though, that I,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:55.060
all the pop-ups that happen to help you out,

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.100
like it's great, except for if you,

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.100
I wish there was a toggle

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.220
that I could just turn everything off or on,

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.620
because when I'm developing, I like those on,

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.820
but when I'm recording a course or something,

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.940
I don't want all those popping up all the time.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.380
So do you turn them off for your courses and stuff?

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.420
- No, I have them on.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.300
I try to show people, like, look, here's your options.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.060
This is the one you pick out of the list.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.620
So yeah, I leave them on, yeah.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.300
- Okay, good.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.900
I don't want to lose my glasses.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.260
- All right, well, I'll try that.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.220
- Indeed, all right.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.980
I think there's also ways you can just set

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.740
the aggressiveness of it, which I think

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.220
it sounds like something you might want,

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.060
like in a serious way.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.820
So you can set it so if you just press a dot,

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.420
boom, like the list comes up,

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.780
or you can set it so there's some other key,

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:49.540
like control dot or something you've got to choose,

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.540
which you wouldn't normally hit in the course of typing

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.620
to trigger that kind of stuff.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.380
So look into that.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.540
- Yeah, I think there's a delay too, you can say.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.500
Like, if I'm just gonna start typing,

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.580
don't pop that stuff up.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.700
- Yeah, yeah, indeed.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.900
- Anyway, cool.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.140
- All right, well, thanks for another fun show.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.660
Thanks, everyone, for listening.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.740
- Thank you.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.700
- Yeah, bye.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.540
- Bye.
