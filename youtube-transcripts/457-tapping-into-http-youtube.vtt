WEBVTT

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>hey everyone uh welcome to python bytes um you know let's get it started uh michael just got

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>back from vacation yay um and uh slightly different time but we'll probably get back to

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>a regularish time next week hello and welcome to python bytes where we deliver python news and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.980
<v Speaker 1>headlines directly to your earbuds this is episode 457 and it's being recorded on november

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>11th 2025 and i'm brian aukin and i am michael kennedy wow nowhere oh it's it's uh 11 11 it's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>corduroy day i totally forgot to wear corduroy's today but i love it is that because the vertical

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.400
<v Speaker 2>stripes yeah yeah yeah i love it i have no no corduroy on either we we've missed the

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.739
<v Speaker 1>missed the opportunity some stripes on your it's not corduroy but yeah your sweater yeah almost

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.160
<v Speaker 1>the sweater almost pulled it off uh anyway um we'll we'd like to thank everybody that's that

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.940
<v Speaker 1>supports us through going to uh doing talk python training or the py test course patreon supporters

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>or people that bought our books uh we really really appreciate all the support and it keeps us going

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>um also love to hear from people on blue sky on mastodon and through email so um you can go to the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Contact us on pythonbytes.fm.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>And there's the links to all the Bluesky Mastery

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.120
<v Speaker 1>and all those things to get all of us.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>We actually have a couple items today from listeners,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 1>so feel free to send us things.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>If you'd like to join the show live,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>and even if it's on a weird time like this week,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>you can find out when it's going to happen next

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker 1>by going to pythonbytes.fm/live

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>and jump on and talk with us while we're recording.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Also, you don't need to take notes

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>because we're going to send you all the links.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Well, they're in the show notes,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>but we'll also send them directly to your inbox

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>if you sign up to be a friend of the show

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>and go to pythonbytes.fm and sign up for the newsletter.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that's all of the stuff.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>So let's jump into the first item, Michael.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about it now.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Get on the screen for you.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about something called HTTP tap at http tap.dev.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Now, this one, it's a little bit like HTTP pi.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.960
<v Speaker 2>HTTP pi?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you really pronounce that correctly,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.180
<v Speaker 2>which is my go-to anytime I need to test something on the terminal

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 2>or that sort of thing.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.260
<v Speaker 2>HTTP pi is.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like curl or whatever, but it gives you lots more stats, gives you more information.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.700
<v Speaker 2>And this is a little bit like that.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to go into, say, your Chrome DevTools or something and say, I'm requesting this page or this URL or this API endpoint.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit slow.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.180
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit funky.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.980
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Where's the problem?

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>If it's getting hung up, is it connecting to the server or is it the backend app server, like Grinny and whoever?

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.540
<v Speaker 2>where it's not responding.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 2>So that's what this is all about.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.100
<v Speaker 2>And I believe it's built with Rich or Textual.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember how far down the Wilma Guggen train it goes.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 2>But it definitely is built on some of those.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Built with Python, though that's not necessarily that important.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Because I guess it's easier to make improvements to.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 2>But it's more just a tool that anyone doing web stuff with Python

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.860
<v Speaker 2>might be interested in.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.640
<v Speaker 2>And I pulled up a little example of just asking

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.900
<v Speaker 2>talkpython, acptap, then talkpython.fm.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.620
<v Speaker 2>And it says, here's the analysis.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.500
<v Speaker 2>And apparently there's only one step,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.920
<v Speaker 2>maybe if there were redirects or something.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.400
<v Speaker 2>It would show multi-stage flows,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 2>but there's no redirects, so there's not.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Shows you the IP address, the TLS version, the cipher,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.840
<v Speaker 2>when the certificate expires, the status, the size,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.299
<v Speaker 2>the server, gets all of that stuff right,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty cool.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 2>hmm then it has this waterfall tiered sort of diagram says the request timeline it took 29

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.320
<v Speaker 2>milliseconds for dns to figure out where the heck that was because i've been on vacation i've been

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.780
<v Speaker 2>going to the website so had to go get it from the internet and then it took 80 milliseconds to

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 2>connect to the server by the way it's about 80 milliseconds ping time so you got to keep that

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.380
<v Speaker 2>in mind when all these numbers right like that's East Coast West Coast the US

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 2>2500 miles so connect eight 80 milliseconds TLS took 130 milliseconds so

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 2>if you know if you ever see your browser doing like keep alive type of stuff you

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 2>know that's a big savings right there it's almost 200 milliseconds savings if

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to keep doing that over and over right so that's pretty nice and

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.140
<v Speaker 2>then you can see it's actually sending the requests and waiting for the

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.700
<v Speaker 2>response. So goes out, comes back, takes 170 milliseconds. Again, ping time in there as well.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.440
<v Speaker 2>And then the transfer is a whopping 4.3 milliseconds. So this is pretty cool. A really

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.740
<v Speaker 1>quick view of just seeing what's going on, right, Brian? Yeah, that's actually, I love that.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Very useful, especially if you've got some lag issues or some part of your website that's a

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>little slow, you can look at what's going on.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Is it DNS? Is it the transfer?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Where's this delay coming from? I mean, it's not a super fine grain, but this is pretty good.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, for sure. And there's a lot of stuff involved, right?

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Like you said, the DNS might be taking forever, which could be

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.740
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem, or who knows, right? There's just a lot of things.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.480
<v Speaker 2>So really neat to see

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 2>this little UI built in Python.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah and i guess we have to say it it's always dns it's always dns i mean that's

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not always dns but yeah anyway yeah but it often often no i i think this is great this is

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.260
<v Speaker 1>cool well um i've got um actually some side projects that i've got some uh some weird

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.240
<v Speaker 1>speed issues and i don't know why and um even just like looking at some of the stuff

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 1>help out to figure out where to start debugging.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, you can get some of these types of things in the dev tools and browsers, but this is

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.140
<v Speaker 2>really nice.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 2>It's visual.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.220
<v Speaker 2>It's colorful.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 2>It's graphical.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I love it.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I like it.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's command line.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Yay, we love command line.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Yay.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I have to admit, I click on listicles all the time, but we don't cover very many listicles

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>on the show, but I'm going to cover one today.

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I actually

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh my aspect ratio is off

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.120
<v Speaker 1>There we go

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Here we go

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.560
<v Speaker 1>This is from PyCharm

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>It's actually from

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Evgenia Verbena

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a cool name

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.400
<v Speaker 1>10 smart performance hacks

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 1>10 smart performance hacks

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.780
<v Speaker 1>For faster Python code

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:32.860
<v Speaker 1>And

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>There's some that

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Well actually I think stuff like this is really good

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:44.340
<v Speaker 1>to talk to people about because we don't really think about performance too much. I mean, when

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.100
<v Speaker 1>you're starting Python, you don't think about it too much. It's hopefully, you know, hopefully you

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.260
<v Speaker 1>don't. There's pre, we don't want people to prematurely optimize, but there's some, just

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 1>some thing habits that maybe are decent to get into that avoid problems later on. And so that's

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:08.460
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why i like um going through this uh oh nice um nice uh menu on the right side

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:15.220
<v Speaker 1>also with all the hacks on the right anyway um the first one not not too surprising if you've

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:21.500
<v Speaker 1>done through any like uh like you know leak code stuff or whatever is um leverage set for

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:28.979
<v Speaker 1>membership testing so you if you've got a big list you can throw the list into a set and then you can

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 1>find out easily if something's in the list by putting it in a set.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.659
<v Speaker 1>And oddly, that speeds things up quite a bit, like drastically.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 1>List lookup versus set lookup is super fast.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Super dictionaries, too.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're looking up by some kind of key, either one, it's ridiculous.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I said, some not too surprising.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Slots are great.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to use classes or data classes even, if it's not going to grow over time, you can define slots and stuff.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And then the lookup for each element within a data class is a lot faster with slots.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.759
<v Speaker 1>I want to jump around because there were some that I didn't really realize or I just didn't think about before.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is use math functions instead of operators.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 1>and I guess I wouldn't

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 1>some of these are weird

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.039
<v Speaker 1>so math.squart

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.820
<v Speaker 1>for square root

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>is faster and more accurate

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.080
<v Speaker 1>than raising a number to the power

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.540
<v Speaker 1>of 0.5

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 1>using exponentation operator

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do that anyway because that's

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.920
<v Speaker 1>weird, it just looks weird

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's bad, I don't know

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.100
<v Speaker 1>bad code style I think

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's a whole bunch of others

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.400
<v Speaker 1>similarly the sine function exponent

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:02.920
<v Speaker 1>log those are really fast operators in math so go ahead and utilize math and uh so that's a

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:09.040
<v Speaker 1>good pointer pre-allocate memory with known sizes now this is some like an old trick that i think

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 1>that i didn't really think that it was a huge difference and it looks like one of the things

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.080
<v Speaker 1>that's it's cool in this article it does the pre-allocated time versus or the uh before and

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:28.100
<v Speaker 1>after times. So there's a bit of, you know, 0.01 second speed up. But so the trick is just to,

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess, have an array with, if you're going to put, if you're going to fill an array anyway,

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:40.220
<v Speaker 1>may as well just fill it with some zeros or something initially. And then it seems like

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.000
<v Speaker 1>a waste of time to fill it with zeros because you're going to fill everything up, but it isn't

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.560
<v Speaker 1>because it's the allocation that takes a little bit longer than the filling it with zeros.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 2>um yeah and brian it's it's worth thinking through like how that goes a little bit because

00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:58.300
<v Speaker 2>if you just go append append append and this is something i don't do and it's inspiring me to

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.740
<v Speaker 2>consider like well maybe i should but the rate doesn't know if you're going to put a million

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 2>items in there every time you add do like a rate out append or list out of pen it doesn't go guess

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.519
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to add a million right it's like well what about 16 what about 32 of them oh now

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 2>we need more okay what about 64 of them you know it just it has to keep reallocating and copying as

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:25.420
<v Speaker 1>you build this up so yeah and i don't remember how i mean it's a little smarter than that so i think

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.140
<v Speaker 1>it like does like doubles it in size or takes a chunk or i can't remember what it does yeah it's

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:35.740
<v Speaker 2>not allocating everyone right it's got an algorithm or heuristic but if you already know how how big

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.119
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be you can just tell it to do it once which is cool but i don't really think about

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:46.960
<v Speaker 1>that too much the um the a couple of the ones down below i really wanted to cover one this was uh

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 1>avoid exception handling and hot loops and i am guilty of this too because i try to have my

00:11:54.120 --> 00:12:00.380
<v Speaker 1>exception handling as close to the place where it can go wrong as possible just as it's a visual

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:07.200
<v Speaker 1>thing and a code readability thing to have this tight um have the try right around that like a

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 1>The example has a zero division error,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.840
<v Speaker 1>has the try and accept right there.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.380
<v Speaker 1>However, that might slow down a little bit.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 1>And it did, in this case,

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.020
<v Speaker 1>was the try and accept on this one.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just not there.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.500
<v Speaker 2>I think the top one versus the bottom one.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, but there's no try and accept at the top.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the baseline.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.560
<v Speaker 2>The conditional check versus.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.319
<v Speaker 2>It's like checking for the condition

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.760
<v Speaker 2>that would cause the exception to avoid the exception.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would just put the try and accept at the top

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 1>or around the larger one as a better comparison.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, I agree, but this is a big one.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 1>But that's a big one.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Then we get into some really,

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 1>except there's exception handling,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.120
<v Speaker 1>using iter tools for combinatorial operations.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.640
<v Speaker 1>And this is huge.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:10.060
<v Speaker 1>If you're working with chunks of lists or chunks of stuff,

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.280
<v Speaker 1>using iter tools and knowing what's in there,

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.820
<v Speaker 1>it speeds up a huge amount.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.480
<v Speaker 1>So using iter tools versus loops for,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the example is here,

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.560
<v Speaker 1>but the speed up is using product,

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.180
<v Speaker 1>and the speed up is massive from, you know,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.720
<v Speaker 1>like what, 440 times bigger or something?

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Four divided by, oh, five divided by 20.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:37.100
<v Speaker 1>That's four.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's four times speed up.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Math is hard.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.460
<v Speaker 1>BISECT is also a great thing to look at.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And yeah, anyway, just some cool,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.940
<v Speaker 1>wow, that's a massive speed up,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.560
<v Speaker 1>100 times speed up for using BISECT in the right places.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.800
<v Speaker 1>So finding out where,

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.840
<v Speaker 1>places where you can use BISECT or inner tools

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.260
<v Speaker 1>and just knowing that those are there to look them up.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Those are good speed ups.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.320
<v Speaker 1>anyway occasionally it's good to think about how fast is my code going you know i think we could

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:18.760
<v Speaker 2>summarize up that article um by basically saying know the standard library

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:29.839
<v Speaker 2>know your data structures mostly yeah use dicts right use editor tools etc uh the and the standard

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:35.660
<v Speaker 1>library is still pretty big. I would probably limit that to the standard library that manipulates

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.400
<v Speaker 2>data structures. Yeah, it kind of intersect with data structures. Yeah, I guess that's kind of what

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.200
<v Speaker 2>I was getting at. And by the way, this was written by Dito Grigorov and posted by Yuvigena.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh, okay. Just want to make sure Dito gets a little credit for writing it.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for that clarification. Yeah, we'll fix that.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.160
<v Speaker 2>It's tricky. I think it's because the way the JetBrains CMS works.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:14:59.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Cool, cool.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Well, maybe we should talk to him about it.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Put him up on a little video call.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:09.800
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.260
<v Speaker 2>What do you think? Do a little WebRTC?

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I kind of forgot about RTC.

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I know, but you and I are sitting here.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.300
<v Speaker 2>People don't necessarily know how we're doing this.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.540
<v Speaker 2>It's magic.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.720
<v Speaker 2>We basically, you and I, we speak through magic.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:33.400
<v Speaker 2>But some of that magic is WebRTC because all of this is recording, streaming, etc.,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:39.360
<v Speaker 2>video and voice, multiple channels, multiple screens, and so on, over WebRTC in the browser,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.060
<v Speaker 2>which is ridiculous.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.520
<v Speaker 2>It's just ridiculous that this works.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.260
<v Speaker 2>So I want to talk about a library from Freddie Bolton, who is behind the Gradio project.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Gradio project, and I had him on Talk Python a couple years ago.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.260
<v Speaker 2>And this is called FastRTC.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.260
<v Speaker 2>So kind of like, hey, I'm a fan of integrating with FastAPI,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.180
<v Speaker 2>and I want to do WebRTC.

00:16:08.819 --> 00:16:12.040
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of ridiculous how simple some of these things are.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:12.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty popular.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.420
<v Speaker 2>It's got 4,000 GitHub stars, 400 forks.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.400
<v Speaker 2>It's been around for a while.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Freddie pointed this out to me a decent while ago,

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.460
<v Speaker 2>and I finally ain't getting around to talking about it.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.400
<v Speaker 2>But it's quite neat.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.380
<v Speaker 2>There's a little video you can watch about how to do it,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's got some examples for you.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to do an echo audio,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.780
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of a sadistic example, you know what I mean?

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Because that's usually the worst thing

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.060
<v Speaker 2>about a video meeting is the echo.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.460
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to listen to yourself echo back

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.500
<v Speaker 2>just to prove that it's going round and round,

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Then how many lines is that?

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean, there's a huge comma in there,

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.840
<v Speaker 2>but if you take out the comma

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.000
<v Speaker 2>and you format it a little bit wider,

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.800
<v Speaker 2>it's probably five lines of code

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.240
<v Speaker 2>to set up a server, connect to it,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.640
<v Speaker 2>and echo back.

00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Like, that's insane.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Insane.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.920
<v Speaker 2>And there's also ways to set up LLM voice chat

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:13.920
<v Speaker 2>if you care about that.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.579
<v Speaker 2>You know, that's obviously the thing du jour.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to my LLM, but you could do that pretty easily, pretty quickly here.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:29.000
<v Speaker 2>But also just stream your webcam back or object detection.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just a handful of lines of code.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.180
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.720
<v Speaker 2>But this stuff seems so complicated, doesn't it, Brian?

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:36.820
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.300
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:37.340
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 1>You're wrapping stuff up in a library.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:45.600
<v Speaker 2>So it comes with automatic voice detection, turn-taking built in, which is interesting.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.520
<v Speaker 2>It's got a UI to launch it in built-in Gradio UI,

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.300
<v Speaker 2>if you want to do that.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.540
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's probably JavaScript.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Automatic Web RTC support.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.440
<v Speaker 2>So mount it onto a FastAPI app

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.480
<v Speaker 2>and get a Web RTC endpoint for your own front end.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 2>So you can kind of go Gradio or you can go this way.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 2>It's got WebSocket support.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Automatic telephone support.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.120
<v Speaker 2>use Fast Phone on the string and get your own temporary phone number.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Actually, that's pretty cool.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.340
<v Speaker 2>So, yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on here.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.160
<v Speaker 2>It says you can easily be mounted on your own FastAPI app

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.640
<v Speaker 2>and customize it entirely,

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.040
<v Speaker 2>extend it to fit within your production app,

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.520
<v Speaker 2>I guess, assuming that's a FastAPI app,

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.260
<v Speaker 2>although you could certainly squeeze it in using, like,

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.660
<v Speaker 2>engine X routes to make it look like one app,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's not exactly the same backend and so on.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.680
<v Speaker 2>So there's examples for that.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.780
<v Speaker 2>So I thought it was pretty cool.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:53.420
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty neat.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed somebody in like three years ago, 2012,

00:18:58.799 --> 00:18:59.600
<v Speaker 1>about WebRTC.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 1>They were doing a, wrote a book on it.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.720
<v Speaker 1>And I thought, like, I don't think I'd ever use that.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 1>But of course I use tools that use WebRTC.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.800
<v Speaker 1>all the time.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.600
<v Speaker 1>So like you said,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.340
<v Speaker 1>we're using it for.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.460
<v Speaker 2>We're using it right now.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.620
<v Speaker 2>We're using it right now.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:17.440
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.560
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:18.980
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:19.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'll ever build

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:20.320
<v Speaker 2>one of those.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Like, oh,

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.160
<v Speaker 2>and then you're like,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:22.360
<v Speaker 2>oh,

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.400
<v Speaker 2>but what if I could do it

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.220
<v Speaker 2>for this project

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.420
<v Speaker 2>or something comes up

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:25.820
<v Speaker 2>or, you know,

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:26.440
<v Speaker 2>just knowing about it

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:26.640
<v Speaker 2>as a.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:28.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And right now,

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.040
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:30.660
<v Speaker 1>like you said,

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:30.800
<v Speaker 1>with,

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.140
<v Speaker 1>with things like

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.620
<v Speaker 1>hooking up LLMs

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:35.860
<v Speaker 1>to,

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:36.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:36.780
<v Speaker 1>some,

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.000
<v Speaker 1>some vibe coding.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean, no comment.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 1>No comment.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so this is a listener suggestion, actually.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Comes to us as a request from Nicholas Karsner.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.740
<v Speaker 1>He said, hey, I'm using pip Deptree a lot lately,

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.680
<v Speaker 1>and it's pretty cool if you covered that.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.000
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like, yeah, we covered it.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.400
<v Speaker 1>But I looked it up.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.400
<v Speaker 1>It was, I should have had the episode up.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 1>But we covered it in episode 17.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:18.720
<v Speaker 1>um that was uh what um 2017 so yeah it was it was a minute ago that we've covered it so it's

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:24.240
<v Speaker 1>totally fine to cover it again because there's been changes so um i did want to talk about both

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:30.520
<v Speaker 1>pip pip dep tree but also i i have been i used pip dep tree for a long time but now usually i

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.419
<v Speaker 1>use uv pip tree and so i just decided to write an article on it just to because i wanted to show

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:42.700
<v Speaker 1>some code examples. One of the cool things I did not know that pip dep tree did, one of the things

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 1>that I would always do is I'd have a project install pip dep tree. And what it does is when

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.880
<v Speaker 1>you run it, it looks at all the stuff you have installed and then shows them. It's kind of like

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.939
<v Speaker 1>pip list, but it shows all the, it's like a tree structure and it shows them like in a tree

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.240
<v Speaker 1>structure with what versions are installed and it's extra information.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm using it from pyproject.toml, I have an example of the cards project, why

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.400
<v Speaker 1>it chose the particular version that's installed.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:23.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty handy, but I would always install it in the project and it would also tell me

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.580
<v Speaker 1>that pip.dep.tree is installed.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.640
<v Speaker 1>But the trick is to install it somewhere globally,

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:35.340
<v Speaker 1>like either using uvx pip dep tree or uv tool install pip dep tree.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.600
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got it just available to you always.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And then you can use Python auto.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.120
<v Speaker 1>And the Python auto flag will tell you,

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.460
<v Speaker 1>it will look in the current environment that you're in.

00:21:49.659 --> 00:21:52.280
<v Speaker 1>So then you can have it in global.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.920
<v Speaker 1>And then, yeah, just look at whatever project you're in, which is cool.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it could do the auto thing, too, so I'm glad I looked that up.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:10.200
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm using usually is uv PipTree because it's already installed with uv, and I have uv everywhere now.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 1>By default, I wanted to go through a couple flags that I actually just learned about this when I was comparing this.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.520
<v Speaker 1>d if you do uv pip tree it'll show you a tree structure but it only shows you the versions that

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:30.600
<v Speaker 1>are installed and it does do like for instance i'm showing cards and rich is showing up and it looks

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:37.420
<v Speaker 1>like it's in a couple places um package tree already displayed rich oh yeah because i the cards project

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:45.099
<v Speaker 1>depends on rich but it also depends on typer which is which also depends on rich so rich is duplicated

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.320
<v Speaker 1>and there's a little note that says that there's a flag where you can turn it off but i kind of like

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 1>seeing the duplication it's um just to see who all is using something now um the to get a similar

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.840
<v Speaker 1>look as pip dep tree you can add show version specifiers and then it shows you the rules

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:09.019
<v Speaker 1>that it used to figure out what what to install but the new flag that i just learned about

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:16.940
<v Speaker 1>which i'm super excited about is --outdated and this tells you um it tells you it it throws

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.760
<v Speaker 1>the latest up it looks at all the things you got installed and tells you if there's newer ones so

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:27.120
<v Speaker 1>you can go into your project and you can run uv pip tree outdated and it'll tell you what which

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:34.619
<v Speaker 1>ones you should maybe update so it's it's pretty fun both of those so i like those tools that's

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:34.800
<v Speaker 2>It's nice.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I do as well.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I've used pip dep tree for a long time.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.040
<v Speaker 2>It's nice to just go, why is this here?

00:23:43.299 --> 00:23:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Why is click installed?

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember installing click.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.360
<v Speaker 2>It's fine, but I just don't remember installing it.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.100
<v Speaker 2>But oh, it's icy because I installed typer,

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.860
<v Speaker 2>and I forgot that typer is a wraparound click.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, and one of the things, for instance,

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about update a hypothetical scenario.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:09.200
<v Speaker 1>got rich or i've got on my cards application um i'm using rich but maybe maybe i maybe i'll try to

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.600
<v Speaker 1>like you know tighten the dependencies by not using rich but if i'm using typer it's going to come in

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:20.000
<v Speaker 1>anyway so it's kind of i like to see the duplication because i'm not going to save anything if i don't

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:26.260
<v Speaker 1>depend on rich directly it's already there because of typer so um yes exactly you're like can i just

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:32.600
<v Speaker 2>just get rid of this thing you're like nope no not easily not directly anyway um yeah but

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.800
<v Speaker 1>if i got rid of typer also somehow and then i could get rid of rich and maybe i'll like redo

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:48.900
<v Speaker 1>the tiny db too yeah anyway um tighten it up all right those are uh that's my items to talk about

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I do have links to both PipTripTree and uv treeRich.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.880
<v Speaker 1>UV, Pip, Tree, Rich.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Also, those are all different words.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:24:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Nice.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:00.560
<v Speaker 2>All right.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Well, just keep going.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.900
<v Speaker 2>You're the only one with extras today.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I got a couple extras.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I've got one of the benefits of working at the office, like the back to office thing,

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.360
<v Speaker 1>is I was walking by one of my colleagues, and he's got a bunch of colors up on his screen.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.320
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like, what are those colors?

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.780
<v Speaker 1>And I use VS Code at work.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And I've often got different projects up.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:28.520
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.620
<v Speaker 1>He's using, and I started using this just like last week,

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.740
<v Speaker 1>a thing called Peacock.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.540
<v Speaker 1>And what it does is it shows different colors

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.520
<v Speaker 1>around the outside of your terminal

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:44.620
<v Speaker 1>and it only, it's, or outside of your VS Code window.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.420
<v Speaker 1>but the colors are picked and stored in the project or like the workspace.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, the workspace.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So that if you've got different projects open, they all have different colors.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.160
<v Speaker 1>So when you're like, I want to go back to that window,

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.740
<v Speaker 1>you just have to remember which color goes to which project.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of up to you.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Ooh, Brian, I might have to install this.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.060
<v Speaker 1>One of the cool things is I'm like, well, I chose green,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.380
<v Speaker 1>And it's a little too bright for me.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I kind of wanted a darker green.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.800
<v Speaker 1>It has built-in buttons to just go a little darker,

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.080
<v Speaker 1>a little darker, a little darker, or a little lighter.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.960
<v Speaker 1>You can do custom, like pick your own color.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.180
<v Speaker 1>But you can also say, this is close,

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.320
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like it a little darker.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.400
<v Speaker 1>And it just is pretty cool.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.140
<v Speaker 1>So I'm loving that.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:35.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's not incredibly popular,

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.640
<v Speaker 2>but it looks like it's from John Papa,

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.720
<v Speaker 2>who's been around in the tech space for a long time.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:39.680
<v Speaker 2>So it seems trustworthy.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Where do you see the popularity?

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Is it in here?

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.080
<v Speaker 2>It's the downloads.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh, I take it back.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was, it may have more than I initially said.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.040
<v Speaker 2>It has three point, basically 4 million downloads.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.080
<v Speaker 2>So actually there's a few downloads.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.160
<v Speaker 2>People like this idea.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh, I was looking at the open VSX marketplace,

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.040
<v Speaker 2>which is like a similar, but not the same.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.680
<v Speaker 1>The other update.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.220
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I mentioned last week is that I'm writing a book again.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And I just updated this last night, I think last night.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.400
<v Speaker 1>There's another chapter written.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.060
<v Speaker 1>So I've got to clean this up.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Both versions are here.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.900
<v Speaker 1>But I did Essential Components for Successful Software Projects.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I got that one up.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And I completely rewrote the introduction.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And I should stop doing that.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.740
<v Speaker 1>An editor a long time ago told me, do a quick introduction

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.700
<v Speaker 1>and then leave it alone until you finish the book.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.500
<v Speaker 1>and then you can update it to be what the book actually is.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.000
<v Speaker 2>And so I got to do that.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.040
<v Speaker 2>A hundred percent.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great idea about the introduction.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 2>I do it with my courses sometimes.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll record the whole course, and then I'll record the introduction

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.120
<v Speaker 2>because I'm like, I want to be able to say,

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.640
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to cover this in this section,

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.340
<v Speaker 2>and then actually have that match.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, but my brain won't let me go on

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.680
<v Speaker 1>if I don't write an introduction to start with.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like, but I haven't done an introduction, man.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:06.840
<v Speaker 1>I know.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.920
<v Speaker 1>The essential components chapter,

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.000
<v Speaker 1>this was tough, man, because there's like,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I needed it to be tight,

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:15.080
<v Speaker 1>or I wanted it to be a tight chapter,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.660
<v Speaker 1>but I rewrote it like five times

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.700
<v Speaker 1>because I had so many stories and stuff

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.620
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to throw in, and I decided

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.420
<v Speaker 1>to take the stories out and leave those stories

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.600
<v Speaker 1>as blog posts later after I get the book done.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.100
<v Speaker 1>But, oh,

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.600
<v Speaker 1>I guess the third extra, I don't have anything

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.680
<v Speaker 1>to show for this, but when I'm

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.540
<v Speaker 1>writing and I've got all this great stuff

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.600
<v Speaker 1>that I want to save, but I know

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.740
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be in this chapter or it shouldn't be

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.900
<v Speaker 1>in this blog post, I've decided for my editor,

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I've got a file called Cut Bucket, like C-U-T Bucket.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.440
<v Speaker 1>And I just put a divider line, put another title,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.940
<v Speaker 1>and paste the stuff I want to save there.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:52.780
<v Speaker 1>And then I don't.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.220
<v Speaker 1>And then my brain, it's a brain trick, is,

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:56.660
<v Speaker 1>oh, I haven't thrown it away.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.260
<v Speaker 1>It's there.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to remember it and move on with writing.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, awesome.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.800
<v Speaker 2>What's your editor that you're writing in?

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Are you doing Markdown?

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:07.920
<v Speaker 1>What is this story?

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.980
<v Speaker 1>It's marked down in VS Code.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.980
<v Speaker 1>And so the pytest book had tons of code snippets and everything.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I think this is going to be a code snippet-free book.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 1>The goal is to do an audio version later.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:28.140
<v Speaker 1>And I might have some code snippets, but probably not.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Actually, it's one of the things of reading the Tester of Development book,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.260
<v Speaker 1>the OG one from Kent Beck.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.200
<v Speaker 1>it's all in Java

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I think

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.320
<v Speaker 1>you're lucky it's not Smalltalk

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.160
<v Speaker 1>well right

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is Smalltalk

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Java as well

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I just sort of scammed by the

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.180
<v Speaker 1>code snippets because I'm like I don't care

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like here for the concepts

00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 1>so I'm trying to keep this book

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.280
<v Speaker 1>the concepts and not the code

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.340
<v Speaker 1>because the code is different

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.259
<v Speaker 1>for everybody man

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.960
<v Speaker 1>absolutely love it

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 1>that's all I got

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.140
<v Speaker 2>alright well

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.240
<v Speaker 2>let's sell a joke then and

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.620
<v Speaker 2>close it out

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I've done a few AI ones

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 2>it's not an AI joke folks

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.380
<v Speaker 2>so if you're tired of the AI jokes

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.800
<v Speaker 2>well then don't worry

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.280
<v Speaker 2>this isn't what

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.560
<v Speaker 2>this one is

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.660
<v Speaker 2>a joke about the future of Python

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 2>and people being

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.240
<v Speaker 2>stuck in their ways

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.620
<v Speaker 2>or having assumptions about Python not being as fast as it could be,

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.620
<v Speaker 2>or having limitations that it doesn't have anymore, theoretically,

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.880
<v Speaker 2>or semi-theoretically, whatever.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.220
<v Speaker 2>And it's a woman in a walker,

00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:54.680
<v Speaker 2>probably 70 or so,

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.460
<v Speaker 2>with the granddaughter helping her back to sit down or something.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:06.360
<v Speaker 2>So I think I named, what did I name the project, the joke here?

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.960
<v Speaker 2>I think I called it, okay, Grandma, is the joke.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:15.580
<v Speaker 2>So, honey, do you know that the gil prevents multiple Python threads from executing parallelly?

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Sure, Grandma, let's get you back to bed.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Bit of a testament to Python 3.14 and Python T and Free Thread Python and all that.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.340
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I can just fast forward.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine me 10 years from now telling the kids,

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.040
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid, we had a GIL.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.900
<v Speaker 1>We had one thread at a time.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.300
<v Speaker 2>You little whippersnappers don't know how good you got it.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.120
<v Speaker 2>My Python used to just run interpreted, and it was so slow.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.860
<v Speaker 2>We would debate whether it was fast enough.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Anyway, that's what I got for a joke for us.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I like it.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:07.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah all right it worked for me i liked it so nice all right well uh thanks everybody for joining

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.340
<v Speaker 1>and listening and we love you all and um we'll talk to you next week yeah thanks brian thanks everyone
