00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:50.580
from the show so um to get started michael um i that was a long intro maybe you could be a little

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.120
more brief with i'm gonna try i'm gonna keep this one brief okay okay briefer let's talk about briefer

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:06.080
from briefer cloud so this is new to me obviously 98.4 according to the last survey of our listeners

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.540
know about jupyter and jupyter notebooks okay right for those of you who don't notebooks are a way to sort

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.700
of explore data mix in explanation graphics along with code and analysis and by far jupyter notebooks

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.900
are the most popular way to do notebook type programming but not the only way right we've

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.940
talked previously about shiny for python which is a really cool option but today i want to tell you

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.440
about briefer and my theory is the name comes from the thing that delivers a briefing because it's about

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.880
not just exploratory data notebooks but it seems to be even a little more focused on delivering a

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.220
dashboard experience that non-developers or at least not the person creating the thing

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.220
comes to look at they can just sort of explore it as an interactive web page okay okay so it is

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.300
i'll give you their little spiel it's dashboards and notebooks in a single place create powerful

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.280
and flexible dashboards using code beautiful notion like notebooks and share them with your team

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.540
and yeah that pretty much sums it up so i believe this used to be a commercial product still is a

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.640
commercial product don't get me wrong it used to be exclusively a commercial project because they

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.720
have a big banner at the top briefer is now open source ghost stars on github and let's see how many

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.060
people have 3.3 000 that's a respectable amount of traffic right that's pretty good but if you go to

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.320
their web page at briefer.cloud you can see a little bit more like what the heck is this thing about

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.420
okay so multiplayer as in multiple people can work on it and i think one of the things that's unique

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:55.940
about this compared to say a jupyter notebook so for example suppose i want to talk to a postgres database

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.900
or something like that as part of my data that i need to pull back well you've got to connect to

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.640
postgres in your notebook and you've got to put your password and your connection string

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.900
in your notebook that's not that's really ideal you might be able to pull in i'm sure there's a way to

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.820
pull in environment variables or something like that but it's not super easy right so one of the deals i

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.040
think here is you connect a database and then you write python and sql to query the database and transform

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.680
it into the right shape and filter it and so on and then you use this tool to create visualizations

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.740
and dashboards and reports data apps and so on out of it so it's like you configure the system to know

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.160
about your data connection and then just any notebook can talk to the database something along those lines

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.700
obviously that's not a totally universal use case but that's the idea okay

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:58.280
and it's also came out of y combinator like i said i think it was primarily just commercial at first

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:06.860
and then expanded so yeah it says connect your data source run some queries run python code using your

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.660
query results as data frames and then share your results so they've got some cool examples in here

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:21.100
they have ai because why combinator and it has to apparently but these are good looking things and

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.320
then you can have notebook styles and you can create a dashboard where you put

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.780
like different charts and stuff next to each other and then they're just web pages that people can

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.760
check out this is pretty cool yeah right i like yeah i mean then you publish it to the web

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.220
so the thing to know is if you look at pricing there's two options paid and hot paid right

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:49.100
so open source self-hosted free install it from github off to the races then there's a community which

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.380
has a free one a pro and enterprise it's not any sort of ad or anything right but i do think the fact

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.080
that it's open source and it has these cool features um sort of executable python is pretty

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.180
neat there's some more uh cool python stuff about it here i can't remember where i was reading it oh

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.660
yeah you can also put like little sliders and date pickers and stuff that will as people interact with

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:17.760
them right it'll update uh what happens but you can also somewhere along here instead of schedule yeah

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.140
you can schedule your python blocks to run on a recurring schedule so if it's got to go yeah it's

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:32.080
got to go pull i don't know daily information from some csv source or who knows right yeah so yeah

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:39.460
anyway that's what i got people can check it out and if you're over here of course there is a

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.460
docker compose.yam also if you're going to self-host it you can just docker compose it to life nice

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:54.100
um well i know that school started last month for most people it's been going on for a while but

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.800
it's still kind of near the beginning and i was i was thinking about students and thinking there's a

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.620
lot of people uh learning some new web stuff and so i picked a couple topics around learning new

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:11.460
learning new things and we're going to start with python so uh i i got this from uh forgot his name

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:19.940
all right ready um jose blanca um and i think he's the dude that wrote it um that yeah um it's

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:26.240
introduction to programming with python but it's all web-based i kind of and it's uh it's it's it's kind

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:33.860
of nice all web-based and just um it's just a free kind of a basic intro um and i think it'll be more

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.720
than enough for a lot of people to get started on there like they're taking some programming course and

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.440
or need to know a little python for a course or something or a new project so um why there's a

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.980
few things that i like about it one of them is it's not a complete overview it does not try it says it

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:55.120
doesn't try to cover all every detail python language just what a beginner might need to start the journey

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.220
and i know there's a lot of great training tutorials especially over maybe at talk python training

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:08.380
um to get started but um but if you were um uh if all you got is uh no money and a web connection um

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:15.740
um i think this is maybe something to check out um i want to point out a couple other features um

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:23.900
uh it's it's running if we scroll to the bottom it's running uh quarto which um of course i think we've

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:30.020
covered this quarto publishing system i believe that we have yeah that comes from the shiny folks as well

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.500
some people that make shiny for python that i mentioned before um well it's based on that with the

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:44.360
quarto live extension that allows uh python to run in the browser using pyodide um and uh and at the bottom

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.580
we can see a github link so this whole thing is open source that's the kind of thing that is intriguing to me

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:55.260
uh the whole project's open source so if you want to uh like if you wanted to have an internal training

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.780
for your company or uh for your own like uh individual teachers wanted to customize this for

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:07.340
your own class um you could you know fork this and do your own thing which is i kind of love that um

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:15.660
and uh i wanted to i i was curious about um i was curious about what it's running so i went over and

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:23.580
um i looked at the hello world so there's if we go to hello world there's a is the first time you get

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:29.340
to actually play with the code and there's these like because it's pyodide there's the you're reading

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:36.220
about python and then there's these little code run blocks and you can just run stuff but um and then

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:41.020
you can start over and do it again but you can also just blop some new stuff in there so i just uh

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:48.060
blopped uh import sys print sys version to see what what python version it was running um and it's

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:57.420
running 3.12.1 um i was i guess i would have been surprised if it was already running 3.13 um but um

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:03.500
but 3.12.1 is a bit kind of i kind of expected something a little newer than that anyway okay it's

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:11.900
still pretty it's better than 3.8 everybody but uh yeah 3.12.1 not bad so um just to be able to just

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:18.540
sort of pull right run a few things so what all has it got in it let's um uh if we go to the intro there's a

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:25.660
uh uh i forget what i was reading never mind

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.500
um it just python's used everywhere we love python and if you're if some of the courses are out of

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.940
reach for you or if you'd like to have something to on the go um this might be something to look for

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:44.140
or especially the real thing i was thinking is people like teachers trying to customize their own

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.100
uh introduction or different things that they're trying to teach using pyodide this is a good example

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.140
so yeah if you don't want to start with let's begin with what a virtual environment is in your path and

00:10:54.140 --> 00:11:01.900
that kind of stuff yeah well that and also just um uh if you'd like to write your own like like online

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:09.020
tutorial book for a particular topic that you're covering like i was thinking uh seeing if i could

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:15.420
do some of this stuff for testing concepts um that'd be kind of fun yeah because i'll tell you i i um

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:21.820
i know some folks that do research and work with teachers like middle school teacher type folks and

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:27.980
they were choosing some kind of programming language to work with with their students and they decided

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:34.940
they're like oh we should use r because r will install on chromebooks more easily than python

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:40.860
by the way i said a message no no that's actually this you can install them both however

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:47.500
if you're using ipads for school or chromebooks your web browser works just fine

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:55.420
right yeah with something like this or a lot of other new platforms and these are so we'll see

00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:03.900
we'll see more of this stuff coming along i think um so it's good we absolutely will very cool now before we

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:14.060
move on let's talk about scout let me tell you real quick about scout apm they're big supporters of python bytes so we appreciate that very much

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:20.540
so if you are tired of spending hours trying to find the root cause of issues impacting your performance

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:28.220
then you owe it to yourself to check out scout apm they're a leading python application performance

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:35.980
monitoring tool apm that helps you identify and solve performance abnormalities faster and easier scout apm

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:42.380
ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks slow database queries background jobs and the dreaded n plus one queries that you

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:48.860
can end up if you do lazy loading in your orm then you say oh no why is it so slow why are you doing

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:54.220
200 database queries for what should be one so you can find out things like that and it links it back

00:12:54.220 --> 00:13:00.300
directly to source code so you can spend less time in the debugger and killing logs and just finding the

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.980
problems and moving on and you'll love it because it's built for developers by developers it makes it easy to

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.340
get set up seriously you can do it in less than four minutes so that's awesome and the best part is the

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:18.060
pricing is straight forward you only pay for the data that you use with no hidden overage fees or per seat

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:25.580
pricing and i just learned this brian they also have they provide the pro version for free to all open

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:30.940
source projects so if you're an open source maintainer and you want to have scout apm for that project

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.220
just shoot them a message or something on their pricing page about that so you can start your free

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:43.020
trial and get instant insights today visit pythonbytes.fm/scout the link is in your podcast

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:49.020
player show notes as well and please use that link don't just search for them because otherwise they don't

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:54.460
think you came from us and then they'd stop supporting the show so please use our link pythonbytes.fm/scout

00:13:54.460 --> 00:14:05.260
check them out it really supports the show all right on to the next one huh yeah so remember i talked about

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:16.060
trying to be more efficient on pypi.org and not just especially under docker and containers not just

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:22.380
blasting it every time like hey my requirements are my pyproject.tomla or whatever results in

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:29.820
200 dependencies downloaded and let's start fresh every time i do a build to run a pr test or something

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:37.100
along those lines right and i i wrote that article on my website that talked about several different

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:43.420
things how do you install python using uv how do you make how can you set up caching both for pip and for

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:52.220
uv to make that better and we both said well github is probably the most you know the probably the worst

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:57.100
of all of these things like and i think you even mentioned that wouldn't it be awesome if github

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.620
would actually just realize oh you're getting something from pypi out of ci let's just give you the one we

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:09.500
got like the other half a million times today or whatever right yeah so uh all of those statements

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.060
remain true and valid and i definitely encourage people to check that out because

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:21.740
i feel like we could just do a lot better and not just destroy pipe i in terms of traffic and

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:27.340
financial bandwidth but what i wanted to bring up was someone in the audience i think it was henry

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:32.620
schreiner but i'm not a hundred percent sure pointed out that there's this thing called setup dash uv

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:43.740
i'd never heard of it mostly i don't do much with uh with um ci github ci that kind of things

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.260
personally it's just i don't know it just doesn't fit into my life it's not a requirement i got to do

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:53.180
a lot so i just don't play with github actions that much but this is a github action if you go to the

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:59.020
thing i'm the repo i'm linking to it says use this github action with your project click here but the idea

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:05.820
is it will set up a github action workflow for both installing a specific version of uv managing the

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:11.660
uv version and managing the caching of all the things it downloads isn't that cool oh that's very

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:19.100
cool yeah yeah exactly so it says it will install a version of uv and add it to your path thank you

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:27.260
that's handy cache the installed version of uv to speed up consecutive runs on self-hosted runners

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:36.140
that's kind of nice uh it'll potentially optionally persist the uv cache in the github actions cache

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.340
that's what i'm talking about where you can get it to say the second time your ci runs if it's still the

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:49.340
same requirements both this is good on pypi and i mean gentle and kind to pypi but it also means

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:55.740
that it's faster you don't have if there's some kind of source distribution that has to do an install or

00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.300
something like that you know some of these dependencies are slow to install if they got to compile but once

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:06.540
they're cached they're super fast so this will make your prs and all of your ci just run faster so

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:12.860
i think that's great there's some other checks but you can come down and basically specify a

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:19.740
particular version you can pin it to a what is that a minor version like a 0.3 whatever latest

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:28.460
you can have checksums and you can even set up caching with your github actions so that's about all

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.380
i know about this but i know people who do a lot with github actions they'll probably be able to take

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:39.180
this and run with it um and i am i'm with uh rhett rhett turnbull says uh i haven't tried uv yet

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.220
primarily because i didn't want to mess with uploading github actions this will be very handy

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:51.180
i have been using uv but i have been i haven't added it to any of my github action of the projects

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:57.660
so um yeah i'm definitely going to check this out awesome hey rhett i'm glad to glad to hear you like it

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:09.020
um okay uh the last topic i've got is um i i'm i was thinking again on the uh people kind of

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:17.580
starting things new uh maybe possibly students is learning some html and um especially uh i was

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:25.980
this is nice it i wanted to highlight html for people.com and it's nice just sort of an online book and i

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:31.980
i just noticed that the the phone on the uh there's there's a great image on the front the phone on the

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:38.860
on the desk is at the time is 404 nice i think that's funny although they should have made it two

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:45.100
o'clock for 200 okay i mean you want to start out on a positive note yeah but that's really clever i like

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:54.940
it um but um it's a it's just a really well written a website and i and it's really clean looking but um i

00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:02.140
i was looking through the introduction and really kind of reminded me how i learned html so i learned

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:10.620
html way like back back in the old days um in the 90s and uh we didn't have a lot there were some html

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:18.460
generators but i we just wanted to i wrote most of my html by hand just in a vi or something and probably

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:26.380
emacs at the time but anyway uh so this walks through actually building in a website like a

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:34.380
it walks through doing a website adding content um it does talk about maybe using a better text editor

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:42.540
if you're just using a just a basic text editor there are better ones um talking about style adding an about

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:49.580
page a blog a resume some great stuff for especially college students to to kind of do something uh nice

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:59.180
in raw html as a website um there's even uh some some bonus chapters on uh it had some simple css that

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:06.460
that was including but uh basically customizing the the css that was included in the the course and

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:14.140
then also covering some css basics because uh that that isn't new since i when i was back in the 90s

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:19.660
writing html no css there but now it's almost it's essential that you you learn at least a little bit

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:27.420
of css along with your html and maybe you're not going to write a pure html website but especially with

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:33.900
things like static generators or templates there's a lot of html we still write even if you're not writing

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:42.060
raw html web pages um so going through a tutorial that just talks about um the basics of html i think

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:49.340
it's a great way to get started yeah so i i love it and that's great it's got a little bit of a hat tip

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.900
to kenth wright although i don't know there's any connection but you know for human sort of thing

00:20:53.900 --> 00:21:02.540
i noticed that if you go to the bottom you have uh github stuff for finding for getting the source code

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:09.260
and if you want need it offline and stuff like that yeah oh cool that's neat and it's uh it's got a

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:14.860
creative commons license oh interesting yeah non-commercial attribution non-commercial share

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.660
like 4.0 international license that's one of the longer creative commons license i've seen but very

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.260
nice yeah

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:29.100
cool cc by nc essay 4.0 i'll have to look at that one i don't exactly know what all that is

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.340
yeah yeah

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.060
uh anyway

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:41.660
i love it that's a good one extras extras extras i don't have any extras do you have any extras

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:46.860
uh just a couple real quick things so uh last time i think it was last time recently we spoke about

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.620
something we must replace micro whiz give us something else and i just wrote down some thoughts

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:56.300
and some links and some alternatives on my blog about that so people can check that out if they're

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:01.180
interested that's a brilliant idea some of the stuff that we talked about on this episode we could

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:06.140
or this podcast we could write blog posts about yeah sometimes i just want to shine a light on

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:11.500
something and we did that depend on the podcast but you know not the entire world doesn't necessarily

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.540
listen they should but they don't really you can find it i know it's so odd brian i did meet somebody

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:23.660
once who didn't listen to the show okay well i know you got something else but i wanted to say um if you

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:29.660
you could be a good friend to all of the rest of your friends if you share this podcast with them

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:35.420
so yes absolutely absolutely all right so people can check that out if they want to follow up on that

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:43.580
also want to give a shout out to carlton gibson he's one of the co-hosts for django chat but that's

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:50.780
not why i'm shouting him out i am because he created an extension for django django you knew a unique user email

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:57.900
so by default the django user model i believe requires you to have a username in addition to your email

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:03.660
and it's the username that's unique not the email that's unique which is kind of weird anyway

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:12.300
carlton fixed it so there i fixed it and he created this login by email with your default user model for django

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:20.060
by making uh off dot user dot email the database deal unique with a key constraint so anyway not a

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:26.620
whole lot to add to that but you know it's got steps on how to install it as a django app and make it go

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.900
but i think this kind of feels like it should have been there all the time so well done seems required but

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:40.220
certainly certainly certainly does you know what else is required what a joke yes let's do it now this

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:46.220
one is kind of a choose your own joke i i didn't pick ahead but what i found is a source of many jokes

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:52.940
that i can foresee coming at some point here brian okay i found the practical dev on github has created an

00:23:52.940 --> 00:24:01.980
o'reilly full res covers for a whole bunch of o'reeillies you know what these are right yeah

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:09.580
they're like mock like fake o'reilly books exactly exactly so let's check out the ignoring deprecation

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:18.460
warnings one see what that one's like so maybe they'll just go away on their own it's a sleeping

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:25.340
cat that says ignore deprecation warnings nice what do you think that was pretty good right i like it

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:33.740
yeah plus i like it i do cats are nice here i'll see if i can find what about this one this one says

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:44.540
is that a camel i think does it run just leave it alone writing code that nobody else can read the

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:55.100
definitive guide oh really oh funny yeah okay and and the the the definitive pearl book had a camel on the

00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:04.140
front right let's see i'll find i'll find oh how about the big regex by trial and error one if i click

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:10.860
this button doesn't give me the full view nope okay so this one is combining slashes and dots until a thing

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:18.380
happens expert regex by trial and error with a very curious giraffe peeking around the corner

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:24.140
adding slashes and dots yeah until something happens all right well that's what i got for you you all

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.060
could poke around in there maybe we'll come back some other time in the future and grab a few more good

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:35.100
ones buzzword like buzz buzzword first i mean that's bud buzzword first development fashion forward

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:44.300
buzzword development buzzword first design i love it that reminds me of uh um uh design by um or is it

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:52.460
resume driven design yeah that's it there you go that's right so nice um well good jokes and good talking

00:25:52.460 --> 00:26:02.940
with you and yes as always talk to you later yeah see you later bye everyone
