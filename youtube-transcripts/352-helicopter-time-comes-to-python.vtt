00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey Brian, hey everyone.


00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey.


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Happy to have you all here. Thanks for watching the live stream


00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
or the replay of the live stream. Thanks for that.


00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So let's go ahead and kick this off, huh?


00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Yeah, let's do it.


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Perfect.


00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000

And also show notes have how to attend the live session if you want.


00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.240
>> Yes.


00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.880
>> Brian, when do you got to start our day here?


00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.200
>> I feel like it's the start of school.


00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.320
So I think I feel like a helicopter parent.


00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.320
>> That's right.


00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.520
Have you got your homework done?


00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520
Was anyone mean to you?


00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.360
Can I help you out, sweetie?


00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.560
>> So the first topic is called Heliclockter.


00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.600
And it is, it is a, like, apparently that's a pun on helicopter parenting, maybe.


00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.600
I don't know.


00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.360
So like helicopter, but clock, get it?


00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.040
Kind of a helicopter.


00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.440
So this was submitted by Peter Nielsen.


00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:42.200
I think he was involved in this, but the idea is, is it's like, it's like date times, but


00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200
they're a little bit better.


00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.120
So apparently one of the frustrations that this group had was with date, normal date


00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.020
and they looked into other things,


00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.700
is being able to just have a date time


00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.340
where you can just enter like the time,


00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.120
but have it be like aware of what time zone it's in.


00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.940
So the big thing about this is,


00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.060
is a subclass of date time with some extra features.


00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.580
So you've got a date time TZ,


00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.940
which is a time zone aware date time.


00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.620
And then you've got a local one,


00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.600
which ensures that the time zone is local time,


00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.980
and then a UTC.


00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.160
So there are some other solutions out there


00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.080
that deal with, just assume UTC plus zero,


00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.840
but that's often not convenient.


00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.640
And I guess one of the things they had


00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.720
was they wanted to be able to have


00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.000
date time items as objects,


00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.360
and then be able to sort them,


00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.520
but have them keep, like maintain what time zone


00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.680
they were created in and stuff,


00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.880
which is kind of an interesting thing.


00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.600
So they've got, it looks just like working with time zones.


00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.060
So it looks pretty easy to work with


00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.120
if you've ever worked with time zones.


00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.480
They do have some other cool features


00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.120
like statically type checkable and pedantic integration,


00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.220
which is kind of neat.


00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.640
Anyway, they've got also an article


00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.640
about why they created it.


00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.080
Time flies when you're having zones, nice.


00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.480
So it's a pretty interesting discussion


00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.600
going through why they chose the solution they did


00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.680
of creating their own and everything.


00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.880
And being able to use it with mypy also is kind of cool.


00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.800
So yeah.


00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.760
- Yeah, shout out to Arrow and Pendulum as well


00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.640
or some of the other well-known ones, yeah.


00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.640
- Yeah, even at daytime UTC they found, but it's UTC zero.


00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.360
And then they even talked about


00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.960
how they designed it and why.


00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.680
So their first thing was just create a completely new type,


00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.200
but then they came up with some problems with that.


00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.160
So they came up with subclassing.


00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.160
So then these new types are types of date time also,


00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.600
so you can use other things to go with them.


00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.760
So I think that's a cool solution.


00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.840
I'm not usually a fan of subclassing,


00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.760
but I think the subclassing in this case


00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.800
makes a lot of sense.


00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.800
Anyway, what you got, of course.


00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.320
That looks good.


00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.680
I think it sounds so easy to be working with time,


00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.080
but it's always so tricky.


00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:26.360
I have something, keeping with the same color scheme here,


00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.520
a new release for Wagtail.


00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.880
And I don't believe we've talked about Wagtail before.


00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.440
It's possible.


00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.600
I did get a chance to use our search today,


00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.060
and just reminded how nicely that goes.


00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.240
I guess we talked at least mentioned it somewhere,


00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.080
but Wagtail is a CMS,


00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.360
the leading open-source Python CMS built on Django,


00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.400
but you don't necessarily have to know Django.


00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.880
It's like WordPress in the sense


00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.240
that you could just go through the setup steps and run


00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.640
WordPress and not even worry about the fact it's written in PHP.


00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.280
>> So Wagtail is a little bit like that,


00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.520
but just pip install Wagtail to get going.


00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.780
It's got some really cool features.


00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.400
I haven't really explored it too much,


00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.360
but it's got this really cool visual designer


00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.320
for people to build out web pages and stuff.


00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.840
Isn't that cool? So you can hit a little plus,


00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.400
get a nice whizzy wig.


00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.720
I'm going to insert a heading or insert a table


00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.920
or an image gallery with these images.


00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.920
Has a cool tree structure so you can


00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.320
Organize your content and because it's a Django you can extend it doing Django things


00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.740
Which is pretty sweet and has a bunch of it you can make little snippets that you can use inside your pages


00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.000
So that's pretty neat and it even has a library for managing your images


00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.140
so pretty cool stuff and the news item today is an


00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.320
an article by Megan Voss,


00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.260
come over to the dark side with Wagtail 5.


00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.040
So Wagtail 5.0 is a new release here


00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.160
with a bunch of cool things.


00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.980
So dark mode, if you want your website,


00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.120
which is backed by Wagtail to have dark mode,


00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.400
well, dark mode is a thing, which is pretty excellent.


00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.080
I'm a big fan of dark mode.


00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.320
It has SVG image support in addition,


00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.920
scalable vector graphics in addition to just JPEGs and stuff.


00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.280
It has an accessibility, an enhanced accessibility checker.


00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.120
That's pretty cool.


00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.080
Like if you're creating content and it's hard for people


00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.680
who have to use screen readers or something,


00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.320
it can tell you that you're not doing that.


00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.120
Like missing paragraphs as headings,


00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.120
misusing paragraphs as headings, use proper tags,


00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.160
incorrect heading hierarchy, avoid skipping levels.


00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.000
- Oh wow.


00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.120
- You know, things like that, right?


00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.240
which is certainly my handwritten stuff that's only,


00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.140
you know, if I remember that that's how it's supposed to go, right?


00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.940
So, pretty sweet.


00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.780
- What's wrong with five H1s on one page?


00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:09.380
- I know, I know. I really have a lot to say here, so it's all H1s.


00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.380
It also has...what is the...


00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.280
If you want to delete, like, say you have an image or something,


00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.220
and it's in your gallery, and you're like, "Ah, not going to use this after all."


00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.540
hit delete, it keeps track of if it's used in any other pages so you don't accidentally


00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.900
delete something that's being used in some part of the site you didn't know about that


00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.720
someone else created.


00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.000
That's pretty awesome.


00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.980
More snippets, more validation, and they threw away a bunch of old code so they can work


00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:45.080
better which, you know, may even have a blog post on addressing technical debt.


00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.380
So a few breaking changes, not too many, but check it out.


00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.380
Anyway, Wagtail looks pretty awesome, right?


00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.380
I think I may have talked about it a long time ago, but anyway.


00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.380
Not the 5.0 release, because that's quite recent.


00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.380
Yeah. I think it's pretty cool that that's there.


00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.380
And I do have plans to play with it at some point,


00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.380
but I've had plans to play with it for a while.


00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.380
Indeed.


00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.380
Kim out in the audience says,


00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.380
"I know several one-person technical businesses


00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.380
that really like Wagtail for their sites.


00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.380
Easy to use for technical, competent users,


00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.380
but doesn't require much of their time to maintain."


00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.780
Yeah, that seems great.


00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.300
Yeah, nice.


00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:28.300
Over to you. Well, I.


00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.860
I guess I go away from Python a little bit,


00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.180
but we use it all the time,


00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.580
so I want to talk about git so I I.


00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.180
I don't think I use any other.


00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.180
Revision control systems anymore


00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.620
other than no CVS, no.


00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.120
- With CVS and all that good stuff?


00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.960
- Of course.


00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.520
- Subversion, actually I touch on subversion


00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.720
once in a while, but--


00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.400
- I still have kind of good feelings towards subversion.


00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.160
The other ones make me a little queasy.


00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.640
- Anyway, the thing that I often wanna know


00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.840
is just like the stuff that happened recently


00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.960
on a file or something, or just on a Git repository.


00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.040
RCS, Mike Felder, oh, Field-Fiedler, sorry.


00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.860
Nice, RCS, wow.


00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.560
takes me back.


00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.920
But so get one of the things is the Git log.


00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.080
So looking at what's happened recently,


00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.720
but the Git log output is not something I like to do.


00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.620
Actually using Git log is one of the reasons


00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.620
why I often pop up like a visual tool


00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.360
to look at my Git repository because it's gross.


00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.560
But I forgot, and I knew that you could customize it,


00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.580
but I kind of forgot how to.


00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.180
so I haven't been, but this now I have


00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.180
because of this article.


00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.580
So there's an article called


00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.300
Get Log Customization from Justin Joyce.


00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.820
And so the default is something like that,


00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.780
which we're showing.


00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.780
It's got a really long hash number


00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.520
and a bunch of information,


00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.780
but it's hard to find the information you need.


00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.480
One of the things that Justin points out


00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.040
is that you can do just something really easy


00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.140
by passing in one line.


00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.900
just the flag that done like two dashes in one line,


00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.580
all one word, will make it pretty nice actually.


00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.500
It just does a short hash and you can kind of see


00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.580
what's going on a little bit better,


00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.900
but it goes a lot further.


00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.620
And I'm gonna hop down to this really cool customization.


00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.180
One of the things is using graph.


00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.900
Graph is great, --graph,


00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.300
so that you can see kind of,


00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.300
it does like kind of a visual representation


00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:47.100
of the different, what are those?


00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.580
- The branches and the merges between them.


00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.420
- Branches, that's it.


00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.020
I always forget branches, is it branch or fork?


00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.620
- And ASCII art for the win there.


00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.380
- Yeah, ASCII art.


00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.220
But then you can do like color and stuff.


00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.220
So there's, the graph does color also


00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.620
if you have that on your, on everything.


00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.020
But it talks about how, it also talks about


00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:14.660
how the one line is actually a combination of pretty one line


00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.780
and abbreviate commit, which is kind of cool.


00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.060
And then what I really love is this is the thing


00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.340
that he comes up with at the end.


00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.500
I didn't know that you could put aliases in the git config file,


00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.900
or at least I did once, and I forgot about it.


00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.740
But this is a pretty cool long alias.


00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.740
He's got LG instead of log.


00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.600
So save a character of typing right there.


00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.120
But it defaults to, so it's an alias for log


00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.560
with a graph with 10, so default to the last 10 commits.


00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.220
And then this long format thing


00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.220
that is kind of ugly to look at,


00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.980
but what you get is, he talks about what it all is,


00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.700
but what you get is the brand, the graph,


00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.700
but you also get somebody's name highlighted of who did it


00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.540
and then also how long ago.


00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.620
So was it 19 hours ago or 24 hours ago or two days, three days?


00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:17.100
Really cool. Exactly what I need usually when I'm looking at a Git log.


00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:22.220
>> I love it. This actually inspires me to maybe play with this as well.


00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.740
I usually use SourceTree.


00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.940
I really like SourceTree,


00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.380
but sometimes you're already in the terminal and just.


00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.980
>> Yeah. So what I did is I just opened up


00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.180
my home directory git config and added this alias,


00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.740
and now I just use get LG.


00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.260
Then I can forget all of this.


00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.000
The other one of the neat things I'm like,


00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
well, if it says by default,


00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.520
you can put the default whatever you want for this alias.


00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.340
But 10 lines, what if I want to see 20 lines or 30 lines?


00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.320
Well, if you say get LG,


00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.360
even though it has the -10 built into it and pass in a -20 or -30,


00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.280
the second one overrides it.


00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.760
>> That's clever.


00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.840
>> It works just fine. Nice.


00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.340
So thank you, Justin Joyce, for writing this up.


00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.060
>> Nice job, Justin. That's pretty awesome.


00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:19.860
All right. I saw that David Lord was the one listed there in the example.


00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:20.420
>> Yeah.


00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.980
>> Let's keep going with that theme.


00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.180
>> Okay.


00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.660
>> So over to historically from the Flask side of things.


00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.740
So I don't want to talk about Flask,


00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.620
I want to talk about Jinja.


00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.180
So Jinja is the templating language that is


00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.180
the default for so many frameworks.


00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.500
It's not the best, I don't think.


00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.100
Come on, Chameleon.


00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.540
So much better.


00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.340
But it doesn't matter if everyone's using Jinja.


00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.180
That's what people are using, right?


00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.640
It's built into all the frameworks.


00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.420
You've got to jump through hoops to use Chameleon with, say,


00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.620
FastAPI.


00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.500
I created a library to do that kind of stuff.


00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.100
But this is about Jinja.


00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.060
And its origins come from Flask, originally


00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:08.260
created by Armin Roenicker, no longer the maintainer, David Lord and folks over at


00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.020
Palettes is, but this new project I want to give a shout out to does come from


00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:22.740
Armin and it's called Mini Jinja. Like Jinja, but smaller. So Mini Jinja is a


00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.620
powerful but minimal dependency template engine for Rust that's compatible with


00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.040
with Jinja and Jinja 2.


00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.160
So if you got a Rust project


00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.000
and you wanna have those templates,


00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.240
you could use this and you'd be like,


00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.200
"Okay, might go well."


00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.100
Python podcast.


00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.100
So yeah, Rust's popular, but (laughs)


00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.520
it's comparable if you got a Python app.


00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.400
It's basically not 100% identical,


00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.280
but pretty similar, right?


00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.440
The other thing though, that's kind of interesting


00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.120
is it does works with Python


00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:01.120
through as project called mini-ginja-py.


00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.440
And that allows you to use the Rust runtime


00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.280
backed template engine on whatever thing it is


00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.000
that you're working with, right?


00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.440
Flask, FastAPI, whatever, right?


00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.240
So you might wanna use this instead


00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.600
when the full set of Ginja 2 features is not required


00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.160
and you wanna have the same experience


00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.280
across Python or Rust.


00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.640
There's places where you can get a slightly better performance


00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.960
sometimes than Jinja.


00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.380
It was created using maturing in Py03, which is pretty cool,


00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.080
like the Rust Python bindings.


00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.720
And yeah, it just shows you how to set up and whatnot.


00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.200
So if you're out there doing the web things,


00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.280
maybe have a quick look at mini-jinja


00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.320
if somehow that's relevant to you.


00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.780
continuing the rustification of Python.


00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.640
- Indeed, you know it's been around for a long time,


00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.360
over 30 years, so surely some rust is starting to develop,


00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.920
but I wouldn't have expected it to come on so quickly


00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.480
all at once like that, but there you go.


00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.340
- Yeah, nice.


00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:14.040
- That's it for all of our items, I would say.


00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040
- Okay.


00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.760
- I've got some extras, but I know you do too,


00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.000
so maybe you go first.


00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.320
- Okay, well, I was,


00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.240
We were just talking at the beginning of this


00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.720
before we went on air


00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.640
that I was having some audio trouble last night,


00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.880
but I was getting the pytest primary power course ready


00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.720
and launched last night.


00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.680
So chapter six, got done recording that yesterday morning


00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.560
and in the evening finished editing the audio.


00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.560
So the first course in a series, pytest primary power,


00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.040
and to sell, so what does it cover?


00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.760
It covers test functions, fixtures, built-in fixtures,


00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.960
parameterization markers, and it's really the set of things


00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.400
I think that you have to know to be able to be using


00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.440
pytest effectively.


00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.240
You could just take this first course


00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.260
and I think run with it for quite a long time.


00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.300
So to celebrate getting it done and back to school,


00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.560
I know everybody's with kids,


00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.700
their kids are probably started last week


00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.200
or the week before.


00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.420
- It might sound like it's for school,


00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.560
but now the kids are out of the house.


00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.520
You actually have time and energy to study things again.


00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.760
That's my house anyway.


00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.920
- Yeah, yeah.


00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.320
So I'm offering a deal for it.


00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.000
So 49 bucks for the first course.


00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.200
And if you want to do the bundle, $99.


00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.080
And the bundle's kind of fun because I've already had some,


00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.560
we've got a lot of channels to get feedback.


00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.840
I had some feedback this last night and this morning saying,


00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.360
hey, I'm trying this on Python 3.8 and it doesn't work.


00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.920
So, but it does now.


00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.600
So this morning I did the,


00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.760
it was like the from future import annotations


00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.780
I had to do to make the annotations from 3.10


00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.780
be compatible to Python.


00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.240
Way back to Python 3.7.


00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.320
So I tested it on 3.7 this morning.


00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.180
So everything should be working.


00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.640
So anyway, pretty excited about that.


00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.600
- Yeah, congratulations.


00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.540
That's a big step.


00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.920
- If you see something like this,


00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.840
you're in the right place.


00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.040
So thanks.


00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.880
- Yeah.


00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.720
(laughing)


00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.540
- How about you?


00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.200
- Testing code logo, enroll in the course for 49 bucks.


00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.440
Awesome.


00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.360
Keeping with the course theme a little bit,


00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:22.000
I have three new courses coming out at TalkBython Training.


00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.760
We have a new HTMX plus Django course, which is going to be excellent.


00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:32.920
A new language-based course without more detail on that, and one or two data science courses


00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.800
coming quite soon.


00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:41.920
Since it's a bunch of things, all of them not quite released yet, just point people


00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.720
at training.talkpython.fm/getnotified.


00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:52.200
And there, if you're not already in the mailing list, put your name and email in here and


00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.040
you'll get to hear about them when, or keep listening to the podcast.


00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.600
I'm sure I'll talk about it then as well.


00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.720
I also just want to give a shout out to Cloudflare Turnstile.


00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:09.320
I've been going through and classifying trucks, cars, crosswalks, stoplights.


00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:20.100
moly, what a dreadful, unnecessary thing. So way back in 304 on October 2022, I talked


00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:28.760
about turnstile, which is a user-friendly privacy preserving alternative to reCAPTCHA


00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.480
and all those things. And it just sits down here. And while we're waiting, you know how


00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:39.720
Like sometimes if you are slow filling out a form, it'll say your selection of


00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.880
taxis has expired and you got to do it again.


00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:47.420
This one automatically, I saw it while I was waiting for you to talk, talk about


00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:52.160
your new course and bundle that thing just did a little flicker and regenerated


00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.560
its validation with no user input, just in the background, I'm telling you.


00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.400
Come on.


00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.560
So, so how does it know you're not a robot?


00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.560
Do you know?


00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:07.520
It runs some JavaScript and it also, I think, you know, I don't remember all


00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.000
the details.


00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.760
It runs through a bunch of other heuristics that like they know from, I


00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.520
think from your IP address talking to, cause you know, Cloudflare, like fronts


00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.600
something like 25% of the internet.


00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.000
So they can tell if you're going to a bunch of different sites and things, and


00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.600
it kind of uses that background information.


00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:29.920
I think, I think, but anyway, I have not even had to find a taxi to be able to


00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.920
But it's made it so that you don't have a bunch of automated stuff coming in.


00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.520
Exactly.


00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.920
People used to be hammering on it, doing all sorts of bad stuff.


00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.120
Yeah.


00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:38.920
That's not good.


00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.420
Yep.


00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:47.920
So yeah, I'd add it for like the login page and for the registration page.


00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.120
A bunch of bots were signing up.


00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.520
I'm like, I don't understand why they're signing up because it's a free account


00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.120
and you don't really get anything for free.


00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.320
So I couldn't understand why they were all, but hundreds of them were signing up.


00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.240
But hundreds of them were signing up,


00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.840
and I'm like, "Okay, I've got to do something."


00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.560
And then this is an improvement over Recaptcha.


00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.860
All right, PyBay.


00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.340
PyBay is coming up October 8th.


00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:15.340
I will be there speaking about Python type hints


00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.180
and how you can super power your apps,


00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.060
something like five amazing ways and tools


00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.520
you can use with your apps, I believe,


00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.660
is what my topic is roughly supposed to be.


00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.860
But I will be there, and people can--


00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.780
if they happen to be in the San Francisco area


00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.820
or want to be there, they can check it out.


00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.340
They gave me a coupon.


00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.380
It's a friend of speaker.


00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.380
If you use that friend of speaker, no spaces,


00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.100
you get 20% off regular tickets.


00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.260
So that's always fun.


00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:41.860
Cool.


00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.360
Yeah.


00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:42.940
Nice.


00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.060
Yeah, always a fun trip, a road trip down to San Francisco.


00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.000
And let's see, following up on your doc strings,


00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.220
we got some really nice follow up here, Brian.


00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.540
Rhett Turnbull says, "With regard to the docstrings article


00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.860
Brian covered last episode, the Google format


00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.500
allows for a raises section."


00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.820
Remember I said, oh, it'd be awesome if you could say,


00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.780
actually, what errors could happen?


00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:08.980
Yeah.


00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:09.740
That's really cool.


00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.060
And Rhett uses Google docstring format for projects, type hints,


00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.980
descriptive variable names.


00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.740
MKDocs and MKDocs strings get pretty docstra free.


00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.500
And VS Code will pull docstrings so you


00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.620
can see them in the editor.


00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.140
and Copilot practically writes the doc streams for you,


00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.100
which is excellent.


00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.340
And one second attribution,


00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.420
John Hagan sent over something saying pretty similar,


00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.700
say, remember we said,


00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.000
look, you don't necessarily need to include the type


00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.660
in the doc string, if there's a type hint,


00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.700
and sure enough, you don't have to.


00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.540
- Oh, cool.


00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.460
- You can just give it a description, which is cool.


00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.740
And also points out the syntax for how you use the raises.


00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.700
So you say raises,


00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:54.300
you give it a list of exception types, and then the description of when the


00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.500
scenarios when that might happen. So for example, raises invalid factorial error


00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:04.840
if n is less than zero is the time that that happens. Isn't that cool? Yeah.


00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:12.220
And finally, John also points out that PyCharm has the integration for a Google


00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.660
Docstrings somewhere in here.


00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:21.380
Yeah, for Google Doc format and how to set that up.


00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:25.260
So it'll automatically auto-complete


00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.740
and render Google Docstrings when you say,


00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.880
give me the quick help, Control + Q,


00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.420
and it'll just pop that up as a rendered sort of thing there.


00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.380
So a lot of follow-up on the Docstrings.


00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.420
- Awesome, cool.


00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.760
- And that's all I got for my extras.


00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.760
What do you think?


00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.760
Yeah.


00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.760
I've got your joke and then I want to do a dad joke also after that.


00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.760
Awesome.


00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.760
So this one is a lesson in optimization.


00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.760
Careful what you measure, careful what you ask for.


00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.760
All right.


00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.760
So there's this picture of two tennis ball containers.


00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.760
You know, those tubes that are vacuum sealed?


00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.760
Yeah.


00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.760
One of them is not at all optimized.


00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.760
It stores only three tennis balls.


00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.760
But the one to the right says, look, if you cut the tennis balls in half,


00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.100
- Cut the tennis balls in half.


00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.580
You can store six tennis balls in this container.


00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.980
Way more efficient use.


00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.020
- Yeah.


00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.420
- Yeah, I mean, your tennis game might suck, but.


00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.620
- That's awesome.


00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.940
- Yeah, yeah, so there you have it.


00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.420
- Yeah, okay.


00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.100
- Over to you to close it out.


00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.660
- I've got a joke that I just,


00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.540
I was reminded of the other day with,


00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.180
shared with my kid, it's a whole dad joke.


00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.940
So have you seen birds fly in a V formation before?


00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.780
- Sure.


00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.820
- Have you ever noticed that sometimes


00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.740
that one side is a lot longer than the other


00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.780
or it's longer than the other?


00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.340
Yeah, do you know why that is?


00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.340
There's more birds on this side.


00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.600
(laughing)


00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.260
- Amazing.


00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.100
- Anyway.


00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.780
It's terrible.


00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.020
- I love it.


00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.460
I love it.


00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.020
It's a perfect dad joke.


00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.500
All right, well, perfect episode as well.


00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.340
Thanks for being here.


00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.180
- Thank you. - And thanks everyone


00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.020
for listening.


00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.220
- Yeah, see you all later.


00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:22.220
