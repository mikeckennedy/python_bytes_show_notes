00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey, all. Thanks so much for being here. Hey, Brian. Hey, Karen.


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey.


00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Yeah, super to have you here with us, Karen.


00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm super excited to be here.


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yes, it's awesome. So happy to have you here.


00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
All right, let's kick it off.


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is episode 258, recorded November 10th, 2021.


00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.720
And I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.200
And I'm Karen Dalton.


00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Yay.


00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.200
Yay.


00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.200
Welcome, Karen.


00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.040
So good to have you here.


00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.680
It is quite a delight and an honor.


00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.200
I've been a longtime fan, as they say on the radio, longtime listener, first time caller


00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.200
of both of your podcasts and books and Slack channels and training.


00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.600
And so I'm really excited to be here.


00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.520
Thanks for being part of the community and all those ways.


00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.080
You and I got to meet down at Pi Bay in San Francisco.


00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.080
That was a lot of fun.


00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.080
Yeah.


00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.960
I don't know if Brian knows.


00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.360
I arrived at Pi Bay and I was going to be one of the emcees.


00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280
I saw Michael Kennedy, who I cherry picked to introduce.


00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.520
I was one of the organizers and emcees for the event.


00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.640
I approached him and overwhelmed him.


00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520
I'm like, you're a super fan.


00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.640
And he was like, oh.


00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.360
So, but he was very gracious about being fangirled


00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.040
just at the registration table.


00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.120
- Yeah, no, you were great to help me out with the talk.


00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.960
Thank you so much.


00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.020
And hey, it's Anthony Shaw on the live stream.


00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.320
Hey, says, hi, Karen, great to have you on the show.


00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.240
- Nice.


00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.680
Hi, Anthony.


00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.880
- Yeah, hey, Anthony.


00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.880
Anthony and I just did a show on Pigeon, P-Y-J-I-O-N,


00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.560
the JIT compiler that he just released version 1.0.


00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.640
That talk Python episode will be out today, tomorrow,


00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.760
fingers crossed, very, very soon.


00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.720
So stay tuned for more on that.


00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.160
But let's start with whatever you brought us, Brian.


00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.080
- Well, I figure we really need to talk about Will McGugan


00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.200
because, you know--


00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.960
- Has it been a show since we've done that?


00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.640
(laughing)


00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.900
- So just get that out of the way.


00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.120
So on Twitter, Will asked a general question to everybody,


00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.780
something like if I've got an open source project


00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.860
and somebody files an issue with it,


00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.740
but I have a question about it and I ask them a question


00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.140
and they don't ever respond for a really long time.


00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.420
So is there a way to just automatically clean those up


00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.740
or clean them up easily?


00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.980
Because we can just assume that the person has figured out


00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.300
or solved the problem or it's not a problem anymore


00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.340
or they don't care.


00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.800
So one of the responses which I liked,


00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.740
which I thought was pretty cool was a bot, a GitHub bot.


00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.180
It's actually from GitHub.


00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.640
It's a bot called Stale.


00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.560
So it's a bot that closes stale issues and PRs.


00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.560
And the gist of it, like on the 10, it says,


00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.300
it warns and then closes issues and PRs


00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.480
that have had no activity for a specified amount of time.


00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.060
That sounds perfect.


00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.280
Configuration must be on the default branch


00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.320
and the default values will be,


00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.720
it will add a stale label to issues or PRs


00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.760
that are with after 60 days of inactivity


00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.560
and close stale issues or PRs


00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.800
after seven days of inactivity.


00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.700
And if an update or comment occurs during that timeframe,


00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.220
it restarts the clock.


00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.880
But all of those are not for me,


00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.960
since I'm an open source maintainer,


00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.240
but I don't like,


00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.800
sometimes I don't pay attention to them


00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800
for a couple of months.


00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.960
(laughing)


00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.580
I would definitely wanna bump that up


00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.880
to make sure that it's at least within my timeframe


00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.560
so that my own inactivity problems might not be the case.


00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.960
- I totally hear that.


00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.000
I would love to see one minor change,


00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.600
one more bullet point on the things it does.


00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.280
Add a stale label after 60 days,


00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.440
close it after seven days of inactivity.


00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.920
A comment will bring it back.


00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.360
But I would love to see this bot put a comment on there saying,


00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.120
if we don't deal with this, it's going away.


00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.440
That way, the people who submitted the PR


00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.380
will get an email.


00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.560
The maintainer will get an email.


00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.960
And so you're notified the seven-day clock has begun.


00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.680
Karen, you're shaking your head.


00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.400
Yeah, I mean, I've certainly seen it on open source repos.


00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.480
And it's nice to have that there.


00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.320
but sometimes it's an issue that's important to you


00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.560
and you don't want it to necessarily go away.


00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.240
Like, and I wish there was a way to like say,


00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.080
this is actually really important to me.


00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.960
Please don't close it,


00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.040
even if you can't pay attention to it right away.


00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.640
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.


00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.280
- For instance, in one of the settings,


00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.160
there's a bunch of settings.


00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.640
One of the settings is a stale issue message


00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.880
or comment on stale issue.


00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.640
So it lets you- - There you go.


00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.000
They thought about it already.


00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.820
- That one.


00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.160
And I think there's exempt issue labels,


00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.760
labels on issues exempted.


00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.860
So you can mark something as,


00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.720
keep this around or something.


00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.000
- See, I don't have that window up,


00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.320
so I didn't scroll, perfect.


00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.160
- Yeah, so it looks like-


00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.640
- That's what I need.


00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.720
- Yeah, this looks well thought out then, I love it now.


00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.560
- Yeah, and it's been around for a while


00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.640
and it's got like, I think it's only 498 stars,


00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.200
but it'll be more than that after we do this show.


00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.080
- That's right.


00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.920
- Exactly.


00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.240
- It'd be at least 500.


00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.080
- Yeah, 499.


00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.040
- No, this is a great find.


00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.880
I really like it.


00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.860
So yeah, good one, Brian.


00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.080
- Yeah, I think I'm really impressed with GitHub


00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.180
that they've added so many features.


00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.080
I use it more than I have GitLab.


00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.960
So GitLab may have as many, you know, in all fairness,


00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.120
but GitHub has added lots of cool features


00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.120
and ongoing development to make things easier.


00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.420
As you know, many things have evolved,


00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.680
lots of more features added,


00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.860
but things like this that make it easier to maintain.


00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.060
- Yeah.


00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.980
I'm really happy with the way,


00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.320
the direction of GitHub these days.


00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.280
So it seems like it's going really well.


00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.200
Yeah, I'm definitely happy there.


00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.040
- I use both.


00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.860
I like them both,


00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.500
but GitHub definitely has a focus on the,


00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.760
or at least it feels like it's listening


00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.960
to open source maintainers and their needs.


00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.000
- Yeah, for sure, for sure.


00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
All right, so I wanna show you another one


00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.880
that I think also may involve Wilma Guggen.


00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.160
I gotta do a quick check here.


00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.080
It is called Jut, Jut, Jut.


00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.040
Maybe if you're German, it's Jut.


00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.480
I don't know, but we could look at the Pyre project.


00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.640
Tom will see if Rich is in here.


00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.480
It is?


00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.160
Okay, so yeah, it definitely involves Rich and Wilma Guggen.


00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.200
And what it is, is it's a renderer,


00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.000
not a interactive environment,


00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.820
but a renderer for Jupyter notebooks.


00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.740
And we've had that in BViewer, things like that,


00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.220
like on the web, but this one is in your terminal.


00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.780
So here's the scenario, like you're in the terminal,


00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.140
remote, maybe SSHed into a remote machine,


00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.740
and you're like, oh, there's this notebook file,


00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.300
but what the heck is this?


00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.140
What is it?


00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.940
I'm like, I don't have a browser or whatever.


00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.200
And so the way that it works,


00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.600
let me pull this little animation for everyone.


00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.500
and have it go is if you're somewhere you just say,


00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.160
I'm gonna go with jute, jute, give it a URL.


00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.340
And you can literally give it something off of the internet


00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.520
and you can even give it like tail command.


00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.640
So I wanna see the last 10 cells instead of lines


00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.640
and it uses rich to colorize and style what the notebook has


00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.060
including the data cells as well as the actual output,


00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.420
a computation, you know how the notebooks will store


00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.140
their output from the last time they were run,


00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.260
unless you clear them, it'll show that as well. What do you all think?


00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:15.100
>> I love that. Sometimes you get a file and you just want to


00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.900
check some introspect some portion of it,


00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.580
and you can't just do more for cat on a Jupyter Notebook.


00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.460
>> Yeah, you get something completely wrong.


00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.940
>> I don't. Sometimes in the space then you're in,


00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.380
you just want to quickly be able to check what it is and move on.


00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.900
And so I love that.


00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.780
And I love rich, that it's, you know,


00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.820
the colorized terminal is really helpful.


00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.940
- Honestly, it might have better syntax highlighting


00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.860
than notebooks themselves.


00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.820
Brian, what were you gonna say?


00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.980
- No, no, just I love, I really like the focus


00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.980
of tools making things usable on command line


00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.860
because I'm a command line lover.


00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.900
And I mean, I've got nothing against doing notebooks


00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.900
on the web browser, but things like this


00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:12.360
make it possible to do things like put them in a pipeline


00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.460
and automate them more easily.


00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.180
And like this, it's not really automating using the notebook,


00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.460
but it might be, you might make sure that like something is,


00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.220
you know, a regression thing.


00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.020
You wanna make sure that things are visible.


00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.020
So you can use this to grab one off your repo or something


00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.820
and make sure nothing weird happened.


00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.460
So yeah, for sure.


00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.340
- Yeah, that's good.


00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.260
And to bring it back around full circle,


00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.660
Will McGugan out in the audience says,


00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.780
"Neat, that's a new one for me."


00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.620
Hey, Will.


00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.140
Yeah, it's always fun to show you projects


00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.440
using your library.


00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.920
'Cause there's a bunch of cool ones out there.


00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.780
Awesome.


00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.020
All right, well, I'm not sure what else


00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.940
I have to say about this one,


00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.500
other than it was sent in to us by KidPixo.


00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.660
Thank you for that.


00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.900
That was awesome.


00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.740
Keep them coming.


00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.500
He sent a bunch of things along.


00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.380
Like I said, you can display the different cells,


00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.500
like the first five, last five, whatever you want to pass over.


00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.620
You can also do things like show it to me just in plain text


00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.300
if you, for some reason, want to copy it


00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.860
and you don't want the formatting.


00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.020
Pretty straightforward to use, but also really nice.


00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.900
All right, Karen, you're up next.


00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.020
Adding on to the Jupyter thread, one


00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.780
of the interesting things that's coming out is JupyterLite.


00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.700
It is being developed by core Jupyter developers,


00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.540
but it's still unofficial.


00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.540
And one of the nice things is it's static.


00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.080
And if you share it with somebody,


00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.860
they can just go to a webpage and you can just,


00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.220
you can cache it.


00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.220
So you don't have to have a Jupyter Notebook server running.


00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.660
It's a static page.


00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.540
Obviously there's JavaScript and other elements involved.


00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.020
And so if you just click on one of those things,


00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.100
try it with JupyterLab,


00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.900
takes you to a browser that window,


00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.940
as you can see, is a static page.


00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.460
It's going to take a second to come


00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.420
up because it's got some JavaScript.


00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.980
If you click on that "Pyalite" and then just do


00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.380
like an import this to see a standard notebook.


00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.580
Yeah, it has a notebook tour.


00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.600
If you do an import this,


00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.980
which is a standard test to do the Python mantras,


00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.380
it runs simply and that's all just running in a browser.


00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.500
So obviously, if you wanted to share things with somebody,


00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.340
it's an easy way for them to see it.


00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.660
You would just send them that file and they can


00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.980
open it up and do some additional things.


00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.180
It's probably you won't want to run


00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:45.900
your core data pipelines in a static web browser window,


00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.060
but it does allow you to do a variety of things.


00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.020
There's some sample notebooks included with it that let you do some things.


00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.620
So you can run through either step by step,


00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.020
that you can actually add text into,


00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.100
as you saw, into the window.


00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.100
So it's a nice feature add to be able to run a notebook


00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:11.160
in a browser window and show some examples of your code


00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.700
in a static way.


00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.140
I know that people have sent me Jupyter notebooks


00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.940
or shared them, or sometimes you can see them on GitHub.


00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.940
There's even tools now that you can do get diffs.


00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.940
there's a service that allows you to do diffs


00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.940
of Jupyter Notebooks that you can do that


00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.140
for your pull request reviews.


00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.620
But sometimes it's nice to be able to see like,


00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.140
I would like to change this a little bit


00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.100
without like starting up a server yourself.


00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.060
- Yeah, yeah.


00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.420
We've been able to host these,


00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.580
we've been able to set up notebooks servers and host them,


00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.300
but there's issues with letting people run code,


00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.420
maybe you don't wanna let them run it,


00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.820
it's only speed only and so,


00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.360
but this is cool because it will let you run it


00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.480
in the browser, right?


00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.200
which is using WebAssembly.


00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.080
- Yeah, exactly.


00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.640
And you can have the JupyterLab look or a kind of retro look


00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.680
which is just very minimalist without that kind of UI.


00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.800
So it's a really nice feature.


00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.280
- I've never tried retro lab.


00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.280
- Yeah, it's just more of a basic like file list.


00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.280
It doesn't have that nice kind of look and feel


00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.260
of the newer version of JupyterLab, but it works.


00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.720
- Yeah, fantastic.


00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:31.000
Just run all the cells and it runs, I guess,


00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.080
in WebAssembly, super cool.


00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.320
Oh yeah, that's a good one.


00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.160
Brian, what do you think?


00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.960
- Yes, a simple pip install and then you run another command


00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.960
as to generate all the JavaScript and things it needs.


00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.500
And then once that index file is made,


00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.040
that directory is made, then it's really easy.


00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.960
You just open up that index.html on your,


00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.920
you can run it on localhost,


00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.760
you can Python start at HTTP server with,


00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.980
you know, easily with Python three,


00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.980
so that it will serve that page as well.


00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.420
- Can even deploy it to GitHub pages


00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.020
or something like Netlify or some other static host.


00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.860
- Yeah.


00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.940
- It's pretty sweet.


00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.780
- Yeah. - I definitely think,


00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.580
- I agree that you don't wanna do big,


00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.660
heavy workloads on this,


00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.500
but especially for graphing and interactive stuff


00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.300
and just like tweaking the data a little bit,


00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.660
I think this is amazing to be able to,


00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.540
especially for reports and things.


00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.940
There's a lot of places where this is useful.


00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.980
- Yep, and you have no security issues


00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.140
or worried about people running code or messing with it


00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.940
'cause whatever they do, they're doing this themselves.


00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.820
- Yeah.


00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.900
- Exactly.


00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.780
- Right, there's no little Bobby Tables issues


00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.700
that you have to worry about


00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.620
with a static web browser on your site.


00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.860
- Yeah, you definitely wanna lower your surface area there.


00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.060
All right, Brian, a bit of an intermission.


00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.060
- Yeah, let's talk about our sponsor today.


00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.500
So today's sponsor is Shortcut,


00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.700
which is formerly Clubhouse.


00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.940
And thank you for sponsoring the episode.


00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.860
There are a lot of project management tools out there,


00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.940
and I've used a ton of them,


00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.940
but most suffer from a few common problems.


00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.340
They're either too complex and it's hard to get started


00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.380
and there's all tons of options all the time


00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.980
make you confused, or they're too simple


00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.240
and you really, you can get started on one project,


00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.700
but you can't use it for multiple projects and stuff.


00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.860
Or they seem to be like geared towards managers,


00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.500
but difficult for engineers or geared towards engineers


00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.340
and difficult for managers.


00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.300
I think shortcut is different.


00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.240
So Shortcut is built for software teams


00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.420
and based on making workflows easy, which I like.


00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.480
So let's say you have a big scale objectives,


00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.200
goals and roadmaps, topics in those and items in those,


00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.640
big goals and roadmaps can easily be tied to teams


00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.880
and individual work sprints and progress on those


00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.640
can be easily flow back into reports at the top level.


00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.680
It's keyboard friendly,


00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.920
so you can hook up short codes and stuff.


00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.960
So the UI is intuitive and it's pretty easy to use,


00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.940
but the things you do every day,


00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.880
you can tie those to keyboard shortcuts


00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.800
and make them even faster.


00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.440
And it has tight VCS integration.


00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.160
So you can update your task progress


00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.400
by just adding a comment or a little key code


00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.440
into your commit or PR, and it flows back upstream.


00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.000
This is really cool.


00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.160
Iteration planning is also a breeze.


00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.940
You can see your team activity when you need it,


00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.000
but you can see your own work really easily


00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.200
when you need that too.


00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.440
And burden down charts and cycle time and lead time charts


00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.540
are just built in for you.


00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.100
It's really great to see all that.


00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.740
So finally, a project management tool


00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.180
for both engineers and managers.


00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.880
Give it a try at shortcut.com/pythonbytes.


00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.100
- Awesome, thanks Shortcut.


00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.020
Hey, Brian, before we move on to your next item,


00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.440
that JupyterLite was sent in by Marcel Millicent.


00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.280
So thank you, Marcel, for sending that over.


00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.200
- Yeah, nice.


00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.520
- Yeah, we always appreciate


00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.960
when our listeners help us do our research


00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:18.480
'cause they have all these ideas that we don't know about.


00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.800
- Yeah, so thank you. - Yeah, thanks


00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.560
for picking that up, Michael. - For sure.


00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.060
Yeah, of course.


00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.200
- Well, ACK, ACK Now, supplies are limited.


00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.280
No, I don't actually use that.


00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.820
- Oh, wait, you get more. - Wait, yeah.


00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.720
I wanna talk about grep a little bit.


00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.720
I use grep all the time for finding stuff within my codes,


00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.120
command line tool for finding stuff in files.


00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.440
And I'm not gonna cover it in the show,


00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.000
but I threw in in the show notes,


00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.940
if you don't use grep or tools like grep,


00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.000
I threw in a couple of examples in the show notes


00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.600
to get you started real easily.


00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.120
I think it's useful to find stuff.


00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.840
One question I did have is like,


00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.000
I've got a command sequence in the show notes


00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.960
that I'd like to have people take a look at.


00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.520
I don't have a screenshot for it, but if I want to find,


00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.080
like say foo in recursively in all the folders


00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.620
and directories, I can do that easily.


00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.740
And I wanna try to eliminate a directory,


00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.660
like don't look in my virtual environment folder.


00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.880
I've got a weird thing about using just grep


00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.400
and then piping it to another grep.


00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.320
I don't know how to do it easier, so please help me out.


00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.940
But anyway, this article I'd like to point to


00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.580
is called Feature Comparison of ACK,


00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.580
Silver Surfer, GetGrep, NewGrep and RipGrep.


00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.980
And this is actually really cool.


00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.020
So it's put out by the ACK people themselves


00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.180
at beyondgrep.com.


00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:54.580
ACK is a kind of a grep alternative that's written in Perl.


00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.260
But this comparison chart says,


00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.540
we need more comparison charts like this.


00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.740
And it compares all these different alternatives


00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.400
to grip, Silver Surfer, Silver Searcher, sorry,


00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.780
is AG, AG for silver, it's kind of clever.


00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.140
But the chart--


00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.340
- From the chemical symbol table.


00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.100
- Yeah, and also kind of a play on Silver Surfer,


00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.740
the superhero as well.


00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.740
So the chart shows like kind of a whole bunch of stuff


00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.740
about all these tools, like what languages are written in.


00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.340
Most of them are in C, but ACK is in Perl


00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.180
and RG or RipGrip is in Rust.


00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.500
So that kind of intrigues me.


00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.760
I've been enjoying some Rust tools lately,


00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.620
but it goes through a whole bunch of features.


00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.380
So I didn't really know that these were all that different.


00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.100
So if you're gonna try something new,


00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.600
it's kind of nice to see if the thing


00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.140
that you really need qualifies.


00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.380
And it's got some high level features,


00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.100
but then also dives into like specifics.


00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.700
Like if you have specific pattern matching needs


00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.240
the output needs, but kind of a cool tool


00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.820
to decide which grep alternative to use.


00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.680
- That's cool, I'd never heard of git grep.


00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.980
That'll let you grep but against a git repo?


00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.320
- I don't know.


00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.960
- It says up at the top that it lets you search


00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.380
a git repository by default, like search where?


00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.160
Right at the bottom of your screen there?


00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.000
- Oh yeah.


00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.800
- That's pretty, that's interesting.


00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.600
- Git repo by default, oh, nice.


00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.440
- And it'll search your git history, that sounds useful.


00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.100
- Yeah, let's try that out too.


00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.680
- Exactly.


00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.480
It's gonna make me learn grep.


00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.840
- But actually, so one of the things I do appreciate


00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.080
is if people that write tool,


00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.840
like little tools that are alternatives to something else,


00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.960
often they do look at the landscape


00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.920
to find out what else is out there and try things out.


00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.760
So actually one of the reasons why I'm highlighting


00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.040
is this is I agree with the author that says,


00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:54.880
we need more of these.


00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.960
Take that research you've done and actually publish it.


00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.000
because sometimes one of these tool authors


00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.040
is one of the best people to compare


00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.640
all the different alternatives.


00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.480
- Yeah.


00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.880
This is cool.


00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.720
Nice one.


00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.500
I don't use grep nearly as much as I should


00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.600
or hardly at all, but it seems very useful in this Git.


00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.880
Like I said, this Git one might make me learn grep.


00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.680
Karen, do you do anything with grep?


00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:24.400
- Sorry, my five month old puppy


00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.600
is very excited about some Amazon delivery.


00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.440
- No, it's all good.


00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.200
We're happy to have your puppy on the show as well.


00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.960
- Yeah, featuring a five moment old golden retriever.


00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.200
He's very vocal.


00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.720
Yeah, I love silver searcher.


00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.680
I think it's really super fast.


00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.440
That's my favorite of these.


00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.480
A long time ago, I started programming


00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.200
in my backgrounds in molecular biology.


00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.100
I started in academic publishing


00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.260
and putting academic journals online.


00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.280
And so Pearl is close to my heart,


00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:04.600
But I'm surprised that, you know, like these Pearl tools that are still around, they still


00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.600
work perfectly fine.


00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:11.640
I learned a lot of Pearl compatible regular expression use, you know, that PCREs, and


00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.040
I remember asking some years ago, you know, in another language, they had PCRE regular


00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.040
expression.


00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.040
They're like, what's PCRE?


00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.640
You know, it's Pearl compatible regular expression.


00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.240
So but AG is great.


00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.000
I think in my world, a lot of people are submitting data


00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.720
and sometimes you're looking for bits and pieces and things.


00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.560
And so these kinds of tools are really helpful.


00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.800
I use Grep mostly because it's easy to pipe it


00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.720
to something else, but AG is great


00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.320
because it colorizes your results


00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.280
without passing a color flag,


00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.280
which is usually more convenient.


00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.120
- Oh, that's fun.


00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.920
- And it's a little bit different syntax.


00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.880
But I haven't used some of these other ones.


00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.760
So this is cool to know about.


00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.080
- Yeah, it's always good to learn about more of them.


00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.160
- Maybe I'll try all of them, just for the heck of it.


00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.560
- Nice.


00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.520
Yeah, all right.


00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.640
I wanna talk about Airtable real quick.


00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.080
So Airtable is like Excel,


00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.980
but it kind of has a database backend.


00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.560
It's also got like a Trello aspect to it.


00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.200
So I don't know if people are using Airtable for things.


00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.120
It also has kind of a Gantt chart


00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.120
sort of project management thing.


00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.840
I don't exactly want to talk about Airtable,


00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.120
but I want to set the stage.


00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.000
I want to talk about PyAirtable.


00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.360
So I just had Gwee, the maintainer of this,


00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.080
on the on-talk Python


00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.400
to talk about Python and architecture.


00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.800
And what they were doing, where he was working,


00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.440
was a lot of things were backed by Airtable.


00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.440
So PyAirtable is this API to talk to it through Python,


00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.800
which is pretty interesting already.


00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.280
But then if you look a little bit more on the docs,


00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.840
it's got, where's the right spot to go look?


00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.460
There is under the API, somewhere in here,


00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.240
there's an ORM aspect as well.


00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.640
So you can even use


00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:13.320
Airtable like an ORM where you create classes


00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.160
that map to the stuff you're doing over there


00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.840
and do select statements against it


00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.800
and delete them and whatnot.


00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.240
So if people are doing stuff with Airtable,


00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.440
here's a pretty awesome way to automate it.


00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.620
I think.


00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.720
- I think it's great.


00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.480
Is it done by the same people or?


00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.120
- No, no, it's done by a guy named Gwee, last name.


00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.780
I'm sorry, Gwee.


00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:44.000
- I just think it's pretty cool to have.


00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.980
Oh, nice name.


00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.980
- Yeah, Gui Tolarico.


00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.200
And he's also in San Francisco.


00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.120
So he's one of your extended neighbors, Karen.


00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:00.560
- Yeah, the Bay Area is big.


00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.680
- Yeah, he was also at Pi Bay.


00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.020
- Yeah, well, there was a lot of people at mass.


00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.580
So even people that are in my community,


00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:13.080
I'm a co-organizer for a Bay Area Python interest group,


00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.400
of the longest-running Python groups.


00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:23.000
Obviously, I didn't start it, but I recently started helping out.


00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.800
And even people that I'm in meetings with every month, and for a number of years, they'd


00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:34.880
have to say, "Oh, Karen," even with badges on.


00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:42.720
So you try to spy people based on their silhouette, if that's the right person.


00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.120
- Yeah, and it was outside, so a lot of people


00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.560
had sunglasses or a hat.


00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.840
Yeah, it was tricky, but yeah, no, so he was there.


00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.000
So yeah, he maintains this, but it's sort of endorsed


00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.160
by the Airtable folks.


00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.040
It's like listed as one of the independent things


00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.160
that they might recommend for people doing Python, so.


00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.400
- Yeah, I think it's great to have Python APIs


00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.620
for a lot of services, you know,


00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.920
have a Python client to help support them.


00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.840
It's really helpful that,


00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.280
whether it's written by the company or somebody else,


00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.120
and sometimes it's really helpful if you're a small team


00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.400
as the kinds of teams, I'm in a research community,


00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.040
we have small teams to be able to like look at the tests,


00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.760
look at their code to see how to use it,


00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.080
'cause sometimes the company's documentation


00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.080
is not great on how to use their API.


00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.820
And sometimes these extra Python components


00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.920
help you understand their API a little better


00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.500
and what you can do with their API.


00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.200
some companies are better than others


00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.400
in documenting their own APIs to be able to interact with them.


00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.480
But I know that people use Airtable


00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.520
for a variety of different things


00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.040
and use things like Zapier to connect it to--


00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.640
it's like a Rube Goldberg kind of stitching together


00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.040
all these kinds of services to do a thing at the end,


00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.120
like make toast.


00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.620
Yeah, yeah, because you want to let the business people still


00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.040
just use Airtable, but you need other things to happen


00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.120
or something like that, right?


00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.640
So when they insert this, it's going to heat up that thing,


00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.280
which knock over a cup, which will then trigger an API,


00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.520
like that kind of thing.


00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.640
- Yeah, yeah, or send a meeting invite.


00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.480
So.


00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.760
- One of the things I like is if like a company


00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.880
that's using one of these tools, having a Python API


00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.720
allows individual hackers like me to be able to just say,


00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.240
how do I find just the stuff I need to care about?


00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.200
And I can write my own little application


00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.840
just to pull out the bits that I need to care about


00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.320
and do it on the command line


00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.320
and probably use a rich if I doing that and--


00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.640
- And only grep air table for things to do assigned to Brian.


00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.920
- Yeah, no, yeah, I've actually done that.


00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.920
You can search within GitHub itself


00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.360
or sometimes I'll clone it


00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.720
and kind of grep around for some keywords


00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.760
that might help me figure out


00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.120
what I need to do a little bit faster.


00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.920
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.


00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.200
And Neil Heather out there, just giving a quick shout out


00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.920
to Bay Piggy's, the meetup group out there, awesome.


00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.680
Very, very cool.


00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.000
All right.


00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.040
- We have, we're pretty fortunate in the Bay Area


00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.000
that we have a several different,


00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.600
from all the way from down in Santa Cruz.


00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.320
So for people who don't know that, you know,


00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.720
the Bay Area is, or depending on how you're looking at it,


00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.480
you know, the San Francisco Bay,


00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.480
and there's meetup groups and Python groups all along,


00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.800
and we're kind of a mid to South Peninsula.


00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.720
There's all the way from up from Santa Cruz


00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:45.460
to up to SF Python, which runs Pi Bay,


00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.400
Grace Law, and there's other ones in the North Bay.


00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.600
So we're pretty fortunate to have a lot of


00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.680
really rich, strong Python community.


00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.200
- Yeah, a lot of great local stuff going on there for sure,


00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.520
which is no surprise in San Francisco.


00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.160
- But it's also necessary because


00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.720
even though things are close together,


00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.000
you can't get there from here usually.


00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.800
- They're separated far by time, if not by distance.


00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.640
- Yeah.


00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.920
The traffic is starting to pick up again, for sure.


00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.920
- Yeah, same here.


00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.840
All right, Karen, you wanna do our last item here?


00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.760
Touch one more time on some notebook things?


00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.920
- Yeah, one of the ways if you're part of a team,


00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.440
everyone probably knows about the Black Formatter


00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.400
that helps you make opinionated decisions


00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.640
or it makes opinionated decisions for you


00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.080
about how things should be formatted


00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.600
so your team's a little bit more streamlined.


00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.880
And now Marco Garelli has,


00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.880
who is a creator of a package called NBQA for notebook QA


00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.480
that did things like I sort and other things,


00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:56.040
has added into the black formatter itself


00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.880
an ability to do black formatting on notebooks,


00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.120
which is great because then it's part of the core package


00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.520
and the support will be even richer, very powerful.


00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.800
So you can just run, once you've installed it,


00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.660
there's a command there shown on the screen,


00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.960
pip install black,


00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:24.760
that you can run black on a notebook.


00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.680
- Yeah, there's probably some hotkey or something


00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.600
like within Jupyter itself, right?


00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.520
- Say that again?


00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.280
- There's probably like some kind of little icon


00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.460
or hotkey or something in there automatically, right?


00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.020
I would guess.


00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.980
- I don't know.


00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.660
I've run it on the command line


00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.120
and the kind of instructions have it run on a command line.


00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.260
I don't know if you can run it on itself.


00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.380
It would be like, you know,


00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.740
modifying an array that you're iterating over.


00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.580
I don't know.


00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.500
- Oh no, I guess I have it backwards.


00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.340
Right, 'cause this is actually--


00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.460
- You can even run that yourself.


00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.620
- Yeah, this is actually going into black,


00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.460
not into Jupyter, right?


00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.460
So yeah, so it's more,


00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.500
- Right, yeah. - Go from the black side, got it.


00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.340
- Yeah, you're running it against a notebook


00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.900
to apply black formatting to a notebook itself.


00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.940
- Yeah, but at this point,


00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.860
how long until somebody puts a button into Jupyter


00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.700
to do this?


00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.360
- Yeah, I imagine that certainly can happen.


00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.900
I think that you have, like in VS Code,


00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.600
you already can apply black


00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.260
or other kinds of PEP 8 formatting within something.


00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.620
So I imagine that totally makes sense


00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.700
you'd be able to apply it.


00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.980
But I guess I think about it in that sense.


00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.780
It's not the notebook itself that's


00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.860
applying that standardization.


00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.780
It's a package running against whatever kind of thing


00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.540
that you're using, whether it's PyCharm or VS Code


00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.540
or some other tool.


00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.020
So I still think it's running against it,


00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.420
rather than the notebook itself changing itself,


00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.100
like spinning around like Wonder Woman


00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:57.860
and becoming a super sorted, I sort, package import.


00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.860
Absolutely.


00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.700
- Yeah, this is cool, I really like this.


00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.880
I've always thought that the notebooks lacked


00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.760
a little bit of coding assistance.


00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.280
- Standardization too.


00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.580
- Yeah, yeah, and also black brings that, right?


00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.000
But I felt like, if you type a thing dot,


00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.760
it doesn't pull up any autocomplete.


00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.760
You have to do the research to know,


00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.280
well, now I have to proactively hit tab


00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.960
to trigger an autocomplete.


00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.920
And also formatting is not just a hotkey


00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.380
for format my code or command palette thing


00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.920
to format my code as easily.


00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.480
- Yeah, I imagine that, you know,


00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.320
we're lucky that the Jupyter community is really rich


00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.420
and people are committed to it and enhancing on it.


00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:47.740
I know that there's other kinds of notebook systems


00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.020
that are being developed by places like Netflix


00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.140
where they're like, what is the bare bones we can do


00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.840
so that our data scientists can run something else?


00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.400
but the Jupyter notebook community is really extensively used.


00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.720
The community is very active.


00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.280
So I'm glad that things like this are being added


00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.280
to enhance its usability and readability


00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:16.480
and standardize it in an easier way for everyone.


00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.360
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.200
Well done, Marco.


00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:23.400
All right, Brian, I think that brings us to the extras.


00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.080
- Extras?


00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:26.920
- Yeah.


00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.680
- Got any extras you wanna throw out there?


00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.680
- No, I just, I'm not gonna put a link or anything,


00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.240
but I just wanted to comment.


00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.000
Some of the times I've been giggling today


00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.400
is because Anthony Shaw's on the show


00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.000
and we talked about Pigeon briefly.


00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.360
And every time I hear about Pigeon,


00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.320
I think of the Bert and Ernie skit with doing the Pigeon.


00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.720
I don't know if anybody else remembers that,


00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.800
but anyway, that's my quick extra.


00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.800
- Well, I know that Anthony Shaw likes to run VS Code pets.


00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.720
Pretty sure that's right.


00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.560
I think I saw one of that.


00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.760
- I wonder if there's a pigeon in this pet.


00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.900
- Yes, maybe it could come full circle


00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.400
and it could be some kind of pigeon in the pets.


00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.560
- In the pets, beautiful.


00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.280
- Like below the project settings.


00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.800
That'd be fantastic.


00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.400
- What are these pets that you're talking about?


00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.360
- Let me see if I can find it.


00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.140
Let's see if I can see VS Code pets.


00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.480
Yeah, I don't have a link.


00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.980
I don't do that much VS Code, so I don't know all that much.


00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.020
but what it is it will literally put


00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.800
like a little animated animal in your editor.


00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.540
And it can be simple like this.


00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.140
This is like a cat that's crawling along


00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:38.020
like a git diff section,


00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.380
or they can be way more complicated.


00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.580
Like here, like see this one, for example,


00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.300
there's like a castle and there's a cat


00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.260
that lives in the end.


00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.740
Alas, Anthony Shaw says,


00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.240
"But there is no pigeon on the pets extension."


00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.260
Well, there's a lot of stuff happening.


00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.320
Like here, here we go.


00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.820
There's like a hunting cat in the forest


00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.140
and all kinds of things.


00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:02.980
So, and Chris May out in the live stream says,


00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.580
yet there's no pigeon in the park.


00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.260
- Yeah, well, pull request accepted.


00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.740
- Exactly, exactly.


00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:10.720
Who's gonna be adding this?


00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.780
Anyway, this is how we should bring it around


00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.140
full circle, right?


00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.700
- Well, do you have any extras?


00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.320
- I do, but I always have them.


00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.520
So let me ask Karen if she has anything she wants to add


00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.700
or throw out while we're here.


00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.340
- Yeah, well, it's a general thing.


00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.820
I just helped out at Pi Bay, I help out at Bay Piggies.


00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:34.820
And I just wanna off just tell people,


00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.940
wherever your community is,


00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.900
they're always looking for lightning talks.


00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.980
It's good practice.


00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.940
It's as both of you know, Michael and Brian,


00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:50.820
that coming up with show ideas or meetup talks


00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.840
and finding speakers is a challenge.


00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.160
And so, you know, offering something


00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.620
that you wanna talk about is good practice


00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.680
and the people in the communities around you


00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.920
are really supportive and welcoming.


00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.720
And a lightning talk's great practice.


00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.680
It gives you feedback.


00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.680
And I know that for somebody who talked at Bay Piggies


00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.400
and also for some of the speakers at Pi Bay,


00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.260
you know, I've been willing to work with them


00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.800
on their slides and talk to them


00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.760
how to give the talk and everything.


00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.160
It's great practice, both professionally


00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.440
and then you have a recording of what you talked about.


00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.440
So you contribute in code or you can contribute in ideas


00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.120
and experience in your learning journey.


00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.680
Even if you're just starting out,


00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.640
talking about that journey is really helpful.


00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.720
Talking about a new package that came out


00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.360
and you guys are doing a fantastic job


00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.520
bringing things up to date,


00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.840
but maybe in these other communities, people can do that.


00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.640
I just wanna just open it up.


00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.840
It's not just the experts who are contributing,


00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.560
people at every level in your local meetups can give a talk


00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.700
and it's good experience, it's good for you,


00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.560
it's good for them and so I'm just gonna encourage


00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.900
everybody to volunteer in your Python community.


00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:07.740
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.920
And if you're thinking about doing like,


00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.840
submitting a talk to say PyCon or another big conference,


00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.880
doing it locally at your local meetup with people you know,


00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.160
with just 10 people, is a really good way to practice that


00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.900
and get a sense for what it's gonna be like


00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.420
if you do get accepted and hone it a little bit.


00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.580
- Yeah, great feedback and great questions too.


00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.140
So perfect prep, great.


00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.900
- Yep, all right.


00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.860
My Apple watch wants me to stand up,


00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.740
but instead I'm gonna talk about some extras.


00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.940
So first one is, I've been playing around


00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.180
with a new password manager.


00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.420
I use one password, I love one password.


00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.140
I use it on all my things,


00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.080
but I've decided that there are certain things


00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.080
I would like to put on the systems I don't want to set up my super important passwords on,


00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.080
or I want to share with people, and so on.


00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.080
I'm like, "All right, well what else could I use?"


00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.080
So I came across Bitwarden, which is an open source password manager


00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:07.080
that also has a cloud back end and mobile apps and all sorts of stuff, browser integration.


00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:12.080
So instead of just running a local encrypted file or something,


00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.080
this is a really good option from what I can tell for setting up.


00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.560
It does have a paid plan if you want,


00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.320
but if you look at the paid plan,


00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:25.480
the paid personal plan, it's like $10 a year,


00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.880
or like 80 cents a month or something.


00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.760
So it's totally doable as for--


00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.480
- For only 80 cents a month, YouTube can be secure.


00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.560
- Exactly.


00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.360
For the coffee that you spilled on yourself,


00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.760
the price of that you could have.


00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.720
- I like this, but actually just,


00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.840
I know you have a bunch of other stuff,


00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.680
but it's driving me kind of nuts


00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.880
that even like five or $10 a month or $20 a month


00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.340
for some things, everything is going towards


00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.280
these subscription plans and it's like,


00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.100
it's just storing my password.


00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.040
I don't wanna pay $20 a month.


00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:57.920
- Yep.


00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.360
This also has a self-hosted version, I believe,


00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.220
'cause it's open source.


00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.760
You could run it at your company


00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.640
if that was not the kind of thing you wanted to do.


00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.400
So anyway, good recommendation.


00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.080
I think this is a pretty neat option.


00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.280
Again, I'm still using 1Password


00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.720
for my personal main stuff, but this is like my,


00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.760
I want another one that doesn't hold all that stuff.


00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.360
And it's pretty neat.


00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.680
Also Chris May, I'll give you a shout out for Pi RVA


00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.360
for the Virginia meetup is also looking for speakers.


00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.400
'Cause Chris as Karen and as we know,


00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.920
booking people to come for this kind of stuff


00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.920
is never easy.


00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.040
- Lightening talks, long talks, whatever, you know.


00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.200
- What do you wanna talk about?


00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.840
Show up and help us out.


00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.320
All right, so Bitwarden, check it out.


00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.040
It seems cool, open source bonus as well.


00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.120
This one is both a joke and a real thing.


00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.120
Okay, so I love it that it all comes together


00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.400
and it's for Python.


00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.600
So Patrick Mason, synonymous said,


00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.380
"The @PSF," this is on Twitter,


00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.860
"The @PSF is searching for an executive director."


00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:01.860
So Iwa has been the executive director for 10 years.


00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.800
Thank you so much for that.


00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.420
She's finally retiring or moving on, I suppose.


00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.140
And so they're looking for a new person,


00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.240
but that's the real part.


00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.560
So if you wanna apply for that, that'd be excellent.


00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.640
The joke is the @PSF is actually


00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.880
the Pacific Salmon Foundation.


00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.760
(both laughing)


00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.960
So they said--


00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.800
- If you wanna swim upstream.


00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.560
- Exactly, but here's the thing that's funny


00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.760
is the Salmon Foundation replied saying,


00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.600
@thePSF is looking for an executive director.


00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.600
@justpsf without the is not currently looking for one.


00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.400
Cheers on a successful search.


00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.380
So Patrick come back and says, sorry for the confusion.


00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.940
The Salmon Foundation says, it happens.


00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.680
We're starting to feel like at the PSF family.


00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.720
It's not like @Java ever calls us broken heart.


00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.960
(laughing)


00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.320
Isn't that fantastic?


00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.560
- Yes, that's great.


00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.880
Yeah, good sense of humor.


00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.360
Now I kind of want to give to the Salmon Foundation.


00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.360
- I know, I do too.


00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.560
All right, I got a quick pull up a little bit extra


00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.400
for this one.


00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.240
So,


00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.000
Kieran, this will relate to you as well.


00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.280
So there's a,


00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:21.160
this thing called the Anime Gan V2 Face Portrait thing


00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.920
that will take a picture that you put up here


00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.360
and it will turn it into anime


00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.480
in like some really wild looking ways.


00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.440
- Oh, wow.


00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.960
- Isn't this crazy?


00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.840
- Yeah, I wanna anime me.


00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.800
- So you can take a picture and throw it up here


00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.920
and get these.


00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.080
They're not very anime.


00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.540
Like I don't think there's exaggerated as anime often is,


00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.400
but you put a picture up here.


00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.260
It doesn't work very well for me with glasses,


00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.960
but I did put up here a picture of my dog.


00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.500
So there's a picture of my dog,


00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.300
which I'll try to link to this in the show notes


00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.220
or something.


00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.060
And I threw it up there.


00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:56.880
- What kind of dog is that?


00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.340
- That is a terrier mix of like 10 different things.


00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:04.080
It's very, very sweet, but I can't really give it a type.


00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.580
But if you turn it into anime, it looks like this.


00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.680
Which is pretty awesome.


00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.800
- Well, I think you should have some kind of battle sword


00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.120
or a helmet, I feel like.


00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.680
- It's just way too chill, this dog.


00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.480
It needs to be much more ready to go in battle.


00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.320
So anyway.


00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.960
- With a slowly forming tear.


00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.840
- Well, go back to the other, the animated, the other.


00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.800
- The humans?


00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.800
- Yeah.


00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.520
So it looks like there's moving.


00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.360
Can you?


00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.040
- Yeah, I don't know what this move, I couldn't make it move.


00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.340
Maybe if you drop a movie or something up there.


00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.980
There's like an Elon Musk, you know, Bill Gates, anime.


00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.520
- So I was hoping that you could do real-time filters


00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.740
so we could possibly do our YouTube all in anime.


00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.580
- Oh my gosh, if we could do an episode


00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.220
like once a year where we're in anime,


00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.320
that would be fantastic.


00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.300
I would be all about it.


00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.940
Yeah, they've got Tim Apple there.


00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:56.780
No, just kidding.


00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.200
- Or a Snapchat filter.


00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.380
You know, I'm really on Python Bytes.


00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.900
I'm not a cat.


00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:03.900
- Exactly.


00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.400
- Your honor, I'm not a cap, I'm ready to proceed.


00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.460
- Maybe we can ask Streamr to update that in our new update.


00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.140
- Oh yeah, that would be fantastic.


00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:12.980
All right.


00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:18.040
And then finally, a couple versions of Python are out.


00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.260
The interesting one is 3.11 alpha 2


00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.380
is now available for people to download.


00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.380
We've spoken about Mark Shannon's plan


00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.980
to make Python faster.


00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.060
Guido Van Rossum has been helping over the last year


00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:33.080
and I actually interviewed them.


00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.720
- Yeah, I interviewed them on--


00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.400
- Cross, go listen to it.


00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.320
- Yeah, I recently had, at the moment,


00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.600
the most recent episode on Talk Python To Me


00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.620
is Guido and Mark talking about the work they're doing


00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.060
to make Python five times faster.


00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.920
This is the first release that has some of those features


00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.560
in it, and you can test to see if this is any faster


00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.400
on your code.


00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.100
So they said they'd love people to try it out.


00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.000
So double shout out there to that.


00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.240
All right, I think that's enough time for a joke.


00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.440
Although I feel like the salmon one


00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.860
is really kind of also a joke.


00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.700
But it was also real.


00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.520
Like if you're looking for a job within the PSF,


00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.940
the PSF, not just PSF, check it out.


00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.260
All right.


00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.560
But as somebody who does testing, Brian,


00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.280
I'm hoping this one touches your heart here a little bit.


00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.120
You ready?


00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:24.940
- Yeah.


00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.340
- So here's a picture.


00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.800
It's a meme type of picture and it has some text on it.


00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.280
It says, "Hot fix in production."


00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.960
Could you describe that for our audience, please?


00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.960
- This is an awesome picture.


00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.640
So you've got like a drainage pipe coming out in the water


00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.120
and it's clearly not attached to,


00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.380
there's, and then it kind of,


00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.000
it's coming out at an angle,


00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.280
then going down, the pipe goes down, straight down.


00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.000
- It's supposed to be connected as one big pipe,


00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:51.840
but apparently not. - Yeah, it's supposed


00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.500
to be connected, but it's not.


00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.120
But actually there's a hole in the lower pipe,


00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.760
so the upper pipe actually just directly hit, it all works.


00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.960
- The broken pipe on top is being poured


00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.400
into a broken pipe, a hole in a broken pipe


00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.280
that is disconnected.


00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.840
So it works.


00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.680
- Beautiful.


00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.520
It's a hot fix in production.


00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.960
Just make it work.


00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.160
- I'm guessing somebody like just noticed the break


00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.840
and then just popped a hole in the pipe


00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.680
in the bottom to fix it.


00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.980
- Yeah, something like that.


00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.160
Yeah, I feel like this is that rush


00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.460
to get that broken website.


00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.280
the website is down type of thing,


00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.700
running as fast as possible.


00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.860
Or it could be Facebook


00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.880
and the whole internal network could be broken


00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.580
and you have to break out like a saw


00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.100
to saw open the data center door


00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.340
because the network is required to open the door


00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.580
but the network is down


00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.820
and you got to get in the door to restore the network.


00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.060
- Well, actually, you know,


00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.540
- Chicken egg.


00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.360
- Stuff like this happens all the time


00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.180
because you've got like a team that finds a problem


00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.780
but the problem isn't in their code.


00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.540
It's in like some other component


00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.360
that happens to be written by the team in Germany


00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.880
that's on vacation because it's one


00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.880
of their million big holidays.


00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.840
And so you just fix it in the other layer


00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.680
or something like that.


00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.160
So yeah. - Yeah, absolutely.


00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.000
That's awesome.


00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.320
All right, we got a little audience participation


00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.160
in this joke.


00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.980
Anthony Shaw says, "Integration tests pass."


00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:19.520
And Wilma Coogan says, "Leaky abstractions."


00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.920
- Oh, nice, well done.


00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.160
- Yeah, well done, you all out there.


00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.100
And well done to you, Karen, as well.


00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.060
Thanks for being here.


00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.620
- I'm super excited.


00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:33.620
I've been a long time fan of both of your work.


00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:38.400
And I just thank you for letting me be here.


00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.260
And thank you for inviting me


00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.300
after I super fangirled you at PyBay.


00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.140
'Cause I appreciate both of your work.


00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.300
Everybody should also help out


00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.260
these two wonderful podcasts,


00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:54.500
Talk Python and the Python Testing Podcast


00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:59.500
and Python Bytes on Patreon, as I have for a number of years.


00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.340
- Thank you.


00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.160
- Super exciting to be here.


00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.660
Thank you so much for the invite.


00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.580
- Yeah, it's great to have you here.


00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:04.460
Thanks again.


00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:06.060
Brian, thanks as always.


00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:06.900
- Bye.


00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:07.720
- See you all later.
