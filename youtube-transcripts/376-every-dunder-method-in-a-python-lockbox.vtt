00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey, y'all. Hey, Brian.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's kick this thing off, huh?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Yeah.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Right. Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is episode 376, recorded March 26, 2024. I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And this episode is brought to you all by Scout APM. I'll tell you more about them later. We appreciate the support.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Connect with all of us, Brian, me, and the podcast over on fosstodon.org or mastodon more broadly.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Links at the top of your podcast player show notes. Join us live if you like.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We typically do this on Tuesdays at 10 a.m. Pacific time.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Why is time so hard, Brian? Why is it so hard?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Just go to pythonbytes.fm/live to be part of the audience, see the older shows.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
All the older ones are there, and they are typically the same thing we ship.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We don't really overly edit it or anything other than we do clean them up, tighten them up a little.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So if you like the ones with bloopers included, you can check that out there.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I wonder if I was a search engine and I was trying to find bloopers, would there be a way to not let me find them? What do you think, Brian?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Well, I hope. We're trying.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Actually, I was thinking about this.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I kind of think that the AI stuff should have the best content out there to read from, but companies are making money from that.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And I'm not making money from my blog posts. I'm not getting any money from that.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If I care about that, how do I stop them?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So Jeff Triplett is thinking about that too.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So he wrote up a blog post called onrobots.txt.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So the idea was robots.txt is to stop search engines and stuff like that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But I don't actually want to stop search engines. I want search engines to find my stuff.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I just don't want the AI stuff.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So Jeff's been thinking about this.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I've been thinking about it also.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So he collected a few links around this.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And one of the things here is I spent a lot of time thinking about robots.txt.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
In theory, it helps control what search engines and AI scrapers are allowed to visit.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But I need more confidence in its effectiveness in this post-AI apocalyptic world.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I love that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Anyway, so there's a bunch of – these are cropping up.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
There's a lot of new stuff going on.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So Jeff has decided to use Django robots, but let's look at some of the links that he included.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So thanks, Jeff.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So there's "Block the bots that feed AI models by scraping your website."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So there's an article by Neil Clark that has an example robots.txt.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And the idea is almost all of these different AI bots, you've got to block them individually.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So you've got to set up these different rules there.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So it would be good to keep track of some of these places.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Hopefully, he keeps this up.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
There's also an article, "Go ahead and block web crawlers," discussing why you might.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And then a "Dark visitors," I think this is going to be one to keep track of, that it might –

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
hopefully, they keep it up.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
But there's a big list of known AI bots to block.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And so maybe keeping up on this might be a good idea, if you care about it.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Jeff's note was that he added it to the website.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Django, there's a couple different articles about adding robots.txt to a Django website.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000
There's one by Will Vincent and one by Adam Johnson, both biggies in the Django community.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So we'll link to those.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And like I said at the beginning, Jeff said he went with a plugin called Django Robots to populate that and control it through his admin interface.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So there's a lot there.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
One of the things not included is my blog is run by Hugo, run with Hugo.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Anyway, so I'm going to also link to a how to add robots.txt to your Hugo site, if you want to do that.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Oh, nice. I don't think I've messed with my Hugo robots.txt.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I have not yet, but I think I might.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And I guess I wanted to ask some questions before we moved on.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
One is, as a community, I think that there should be an easier way to say, "Don't scrape this if you're an AI,"

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
other than listing each one. We should have a standard for that.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
But what do you think of this?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
As a content creator, should I care about that?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I mean, would you?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
You know, it's such an interesting question.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I think it's pretty fraught, right?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
On one hand, I don't want to feed the AIs either, necessarily.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I think that it's super awesome that you could go to chat.gpt and say things like,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
"What does talk.python think about this?"

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Or, "Write me a summary of this in the style of a talk.python interview."

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Is that harming me? No, probably not.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Is it creating some cool aspect, like halo, of the content creation side?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The fact that chat.gpt knows about those kind of things, that's kind of cool.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Kind of on the plus side.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I don't know.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
For you, a lot of your content is open, but a lot of your content is behind a paywall with talk.python training.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
If somebody were to throw all of those trainings into an AI model...

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Yeah, that would be different, right?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Yeah.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I mean, I certainly have a no-robot, no-index settings on certain aspects of the site there.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
It's also behind accounts and logins, so somebody would have to be kind of maliciously doing that,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
which I imagine that's probably already been done.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But yeah, that's a different kind of deal.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Maybe the biggest case of this is the link tax that Australia, Spain, and Canada all tried to put onto the search engines,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and Facebook, and social platforms.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Like... I hope I'm getting this right. I think it's Canada.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
They all blur together, but Canada is the most recent one of these, for sure.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And they passed a law saying, "Well, if one of these big American companies wants to send traffic...

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
We talked about this. If they want to send traffic to one of our news sites, then they have to pay them for the right to do that."

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Maybe it is.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Well, it's kind of like Google News or something.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Maybe it's Australia. I think it was Facebook.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I'm sorry, folks, if I'm crossing over a company.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I think Facebook just declined to renew their agreements with the Australian newspapers and saying,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
"You know what? We're not going to send any more traffic, and we're not going to allow any links to you whatsoever."

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And that's going to be a negative for those news companies as well, right?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The fact that they kind of had this shady deal where Facebook would summarize a little bit,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
so maybe you don't need to click the link to go to it, but now they're going to have no links whatsoever,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and they're not going to be in a better place because of that either.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So it's really this "damned if you do, damned if you don't" type of thing is what I'm trying to get at.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
The biggest example of that playing out is with these news organizations and the social media and search engines.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Yeah, except for, I don't know, the AIS, I don't think they're linking back to the original content.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
No, you got a good point there, that at least search engines and stuff and social media,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
they credit you, they send traffic to you, whereas we're going to have to reckon with the AI stuff in some way,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
because it just says, "Here's the answer." And how did it get it? I don't know.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Maybe that's your answer repurposed, who knows, right? But you get zero credit for that.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Right.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Anyway, that's a good point. We're probably not going to solve that today, maybe next week.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Want to come back and solve it next week?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Yeah, sure.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Well, if you were to be automating requests to these websites, what is the most popular way to do that?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Well, it's writing the name, requests. And requests by Kenneth Wrights has been migrated over.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
It's so popular, it's migrated over to the PSF itself, right?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I don't remember where it said. Yeah, it actually still has it says,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
"Request is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around 30 million downloads a week."

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Wow.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And it's used by over a million repositories on GitHub. You can probably trust it.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But there are things that it doesn't do, things that it's not necessarily wanting to lead the bleeding edge on.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I mean, just with that amount of usage, you've got to be careful, right?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So I'm going to point you at a fork of requests. NiQuest? I'm not sure, hopefully. NiQuest instead of reQuest? Ni?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I'm not sure I'm getting the reference here. There's probably some cleverness to the name.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I'm sorry for not getting it there, Java.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So anyway, it says, "Requests, but with HTTP/3, HTTP/2, multiplexed connections."

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So if you're downloading, you could create multiple connections to the server and download multiple streams.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I think that's what that means. System certificate authorities, certificate revocation.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So if you want to control what certificates you trust, maybe there's some that have been known to be doing bad things,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000
or you just don't want to allow access to certain parts of the internet, you can revoke those certificates and their authorities and so on.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
DNS over HTTPS, TLS, and QUIC.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So if you want to have better control over how DNS works, if you want to escape what DNS is happening on your server

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and explicitly control it from your application, you can do that securely, which is awesome.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It has async and await, DNS security, and it says much pain removed, which is cool.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So anyway, this is a pretty interesting thing. If you know requests, you basically know this,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
except for that it also has async versions, which is kind of cool.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
But yeah, it's got like a great long feature list and why they did this.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Yeah, so worth looking at, I think.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Yeah, definitely. That's pretty cool.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Yeah, but a lot of those things like the certificate stuff or DNS over HTTPS or DNS security are areas you're like,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
if we really need that, as most people probably don't, but if you do, this looks pretty cool.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Yeah, I think it's, I think my guess is that the name is based on the Knights of Nii.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So it'd be NiiQuests, I think.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
NiiQuests. All right, let's go with it. NiiQuests. Yeah, because of course we have those themes, right?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Yeah.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Of course we do. Now, Brian, we do have a sponsor for this episode, right?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Yay.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Yay. Let me tell you real quick about Scout APM.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
They're big supporters of Python Bytes, so we appreciate that very much.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So if you are tired of spending hours trying to find the root cause of issues impacting your performance,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
then you owe it to yourself to check out Scout APM.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
They're a leading Python application performance monitoring tool, APM,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that helps you identify and solve performance abnormalities faster and easier.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Scout APM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks, slow database queries, background jobs,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and the dreaded N+1 queries that you can end up if you do lazy loading in your ORM,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and then you say, "Oh, no. Why is it so slow? Why are you doing 200 database queries for what should be one?"

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So you can find out things like that.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And it links it back directly to source code, so you can spend less time in the debugger and healing logs

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and just finding the problems and moving on.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And you'll love it because it's built for developers by developers.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
It makes it easy to get set up.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Seriously, you can do it in less than four minutes, so that's awesome.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And the best part is the pricing is straightforward.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
You only pay for the data that you use with no hidden overage fees or per-seat pricing.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And I just learned this, Brian.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
They also have it. They provide the pro version for free to all open source projects.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So if you're an open source maintainer and you want to have Scout APM for that project,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
just shoot them a message or something on their pricing page about that.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So you can start your free trial and get instant insights today.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000

The link is in your podcast player show notes as well.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And please use that link.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Don't just search for them because otherwise they don't think you came from us.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And then they'd stop supporting the show.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So please use our link, pythonbytes.fm/scout.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Check them out. It really supports the show.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Indeed, indeed. Thank you.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Brian?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Yeah.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Underscore has some funky meanings in Python.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
We love the underscore.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I'm going to get a new keyboard where on my keyboard here,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
it has two independent buttons for the space key.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I'm going to make this one just the underscore.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Okay. Sure. You can do that.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And you'll probably need it.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
What could I do with it?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Because of all of the Dunder methods.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We have so many underscores that we called two underscores Dunders in Python.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So, and what are all these Dunder methods for?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
So, Trey Hunter has actually put together this really cool resource.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Every Dunder method in Python.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And actually, I mean, you know, I thought I knew quite a few.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And I use probably repper and stir probably the most

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
to make sure that my objects are representable or convertible to strings.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
But there's quite a few more.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And so he goes through like, here's our essentials for a repper.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And, oh, I, you know, he calls equality essential,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
but I don't really, I guess maybe I don't make my own custom data types

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
as often as maybe I should.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
But there's the equal EQ that does equality

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and then repper that converts to rep.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And it also used, it's also used with a stir

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
if you didn't have a stir method, but you can have those be separate.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
So the other one that's common is a Dunder init

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
for how you initialize classes, which, you know, to be honest,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I use probably adders and data classes more than custom data classes.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So I don't really write that myself a lot,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
but I often use it in initializing my, another class

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
if I derive from something else.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Anyway, moving on, there's tons.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
He's got equality and hashability.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Hashability is important if you're creating an object

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
that should be hashable, that way you can create.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Why do you care about that?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
You care about hashability because that means your objects can be used,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
if they're hashable, they can be used for,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I think there's some other rules too,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
but I think it's more important to have hashability.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So you can have a hashable object,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
but you can't have a hashable object.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
So you can't have a hashable object,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
but you can have a hashable object.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
So you can have a hashable object,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
but you can't have a hashable object.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So you can't have a hashable object.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
- You don't think about type conversions that much, right?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Because you don't think about casting

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
and all that stuff in Python as much.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
- Right, but it is kind of cool.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
I didn't know that, I guess I knew you could do this,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
but I kind of forgot that you can,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
so if you say like int of something or bool of something,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
if that makes sense for your data type,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
you can write your own dunder method

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
so that people can just use the built-in type conversion,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
which is pretty cool.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I didn't know about this format thing

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
so that you can use the f-strings appropriately

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
if you've got the format.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
- I think you can pass modifiers from the S string.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So like with a floating point number,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
you can say like curly the number--

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
- Oh, it's for the modifier.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
- Colon .2F, comma .2F,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and it'll be like comma separated two decimal.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I think you can take your own format specifier there.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I think that's what that's for.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
- Okay, I'll have to research that a little bit more.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Anyway, the dunder methods around context managers,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
which is actually kind of a funny thing.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
I think that I've read a lot of tutorials

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
around context managers,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and sometimes they like try to tell you

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
how to build one up from scratch.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I've never built one up from scratch.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I always use like some of the wrappers and stuff

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
to do context managers.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Anyway, containers and collections,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
if you're gonna do a container

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
that you want length to work with or to iterate through,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
you need some dunder methods for that.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Callability is one I've used frequently.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
You can create an object that's callable

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
if your class has a call method,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
which is kind of fun to make callable objects.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
A bunch of arithmetic operators,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
so you can overload things in place,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
built-in math functions, attribute access,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
all sorts of dunder methods for you.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So anyway, if you're thinking of overloading a class

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
so that it can deal with different built-in operators,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
check out Tarih's article.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
- Yeah, that's pretty nuts.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Actually, I kind of am coming away from this

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
the same feeling as, like, I think I knew these.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Like, actually, no, there's more stuff.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
There's more than I realized.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
- Yeah, there's a lot.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I like the orderability, though.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
It's 'cause I often, at the very least,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I want to be able to sort things.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
- Yeah, yeah, indeed.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Sorting is good.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
The one that I think is new to me,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
maybe the casting ones,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
but also the string formatting one.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Like, you could have a user object

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
that you could say, like, colon E for their email.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I mean, not necessarily would do that exactly,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
but just weird, right?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
- Yeah, I'll have to play with that.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
- Yeah, all right, let's talk about this next one.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
A lockbox.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I don't think this is Python exactly.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Oh, wait, I take it back.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
It is Python, 100%.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
But also, even if it weren't,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
it's the kind of thing that you would use

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
as a Python person,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
not necessarily make it part of your app.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
So this takes a bit of,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
it takes a moment to get your head around.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
So lockbox is a forward proxy

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
for making third-party API calls.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And you're like, okay, keep talking.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Maybe it'll all make sense eventually.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
So here's the deal.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
If you're gonna integrate with some third-party thing,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
think Zapier, if this, then that, et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And those things are making API calls on your behalf.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
You have to give them the API calls

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
for the destination thing they're integrating with.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So the example they give is if you wanna do a Zapier thing

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
over to Slack or Jira or whatever,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
you give Zapier your Slack API key

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
or your Jira API key, which may be fine.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I mean, Zapier is certainly a trustworthy company.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
I've had the CEO on Talk Python a few times.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
He's great.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
But just on principle, you might not wanna do that.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
You know what I mean?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
- Yeah.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
- So that's what this thing is for.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
So instead of giving that third party like Zapier,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
if this, then that, your tokens,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
what you can do is you can set up this lockbox thing

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
and it's like an intermediary for this whole process.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
So you can register an app in your lockbox

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
and it gets its own just for this one purpose API key.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
You give that to Zapier.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
So Zapier calls lockbox, lockbox calls Jira.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Lockbox, lockbox calls Slack or lockbox calls Jira

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
or whatever.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And it has a couple of advantages.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
So you can do things like you can audit

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
what actual traffic is being done.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
So you can see exactly what, let's just keep with Zapier.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So what Zapier is doing on your behalf,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
exactly what data is passed.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And if something's going wrong, you could see that.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
- If Zapier is charging you for too many zaps,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
you can say, I didn't use this many.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
- Exactly, here's how many zaps exactly you used.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Yeah, some of these are plans.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
You should be able to restrict access to external APIs

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
in a more fine grained manner.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
- Ooh, rate limiting.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
- Yeah, rate limiting on third party API calls.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
But the primary purpose of it is that the API keys

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
are not exposed to anyone else.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
They just live in this lockbox thing that you control.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And then you can, of course, throw them away.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Drawbacks are, well, you got to run your lockbox.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
(both laughing)

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Basically.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And so on.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
But yeah, it's pip install lockbox-proxy

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
and you set the sucker up and off it goes.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
I think it's pretty cool.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
- Yeah, yeah, interesting.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
- Yeah.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
- For, especially, even if I didn't use this all the time,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
to be able to add it later if I needed to,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
to intercept that and for,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
especially for some monitoring purposes.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
So yeah, it's an interesting idea.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
- Yeah.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Andrew out in the audience says,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
"Not that it gets sappier,"

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
but that kind of feels like an indication

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
that maybe it isn't the type of thing

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
you should be handing off to third parties.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
(chuckles)

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
I may agree with you.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Although I think in practice,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
a lot of people pass their keys all over the place

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
to get stuff done, you know?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Especially the less developer-y.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
The less developer-y you are,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
the more you're like, "Just click these things together

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
"and do it for me."

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Yeah.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
- What could go wrong?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
(both laugh)

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
- YOLO, come on.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
My password's the letter A.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
I don't see any problem here.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
This is way more secure than that.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
- Good thing we made all passwords password.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
- Exactly.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
That way I never forget it.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
It just says, "What's your password?"

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And I'm like, "Well, you gave me the hint right there."

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
- It's right there. - Perfect.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
(Andrew laughs)

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Well, that's our items, our main items.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
What else you got there?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
- I got a couple extra.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Since I covered Django a little bit earlier,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
I ran across Adam Johnson's Django Join the Community

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
on Mastodon.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
I'm also working with Django a lot lately.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
So trying to follow some of the Django people

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
on Mastodon is good.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
So he's got a good resource for people that wanna...

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
If you're a Django person

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
and you wanna get started on Mastodon,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
there's some good people to follow,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
some projects, official accounts,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
around Django.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.000
And reminders to do a welcome post,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
which I still have forgotten to do.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
So sorry, people out there that don't know who I am.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Anyway, yeah, the introductory post is a good idea.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
But and to throw it.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
So yeah, that, the other one extra got sent in

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
just this morning from Ken Van Wyk.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
And it's a website called unmaintained.tech.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
And essentially the idea is there's a badge

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
and there's some description.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
So basically if you wanna,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
if you have some open source stuff

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
that you're just kind of done with

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
and nobody wants to take it over,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
you can just link to this to tell people

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
that you're not intending to maintain it.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
People can still use it as a reference and read it,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
but no promises as to whether it's gonna work

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
'cause I'm done.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
So interesting.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
- Yeah, some things are done.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
They're just done.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
- Yeah, some things, and it's okay.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
So you don't have to take them down.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Just tell people that you're not working with it anymore.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
- Interesting.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Wasn't there a thing with GitHub

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
where they were going to either take down or charge

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
very, very briefly for things that had no activity

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
over a two year period or something like that?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
And they quickly rolled it back

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
'cause people were like, stuff can be done.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Don't do that.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
- Okay, yeah, I think that was pre-Microsoft Takeover.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
- Yeah, that might have, you know what?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I think it probably was when they were like,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
how are we gonna pay for this stuff?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
We need to start getting rid of some of the storage

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
of things that were just kind of just abandoned.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
- Yeah, and now they don't wanna do that

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
'cause there's all that AI meat in there to eat.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
- That's right.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Well, well, speaking of takeovers,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
US sues Apple for illegal monopoly over smartphones,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
says The Verge.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Now, I think the monopoly angle

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
is a little bit of interesting here.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
I had some conversations on Mastodon.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
People are like, oh, they only have 20% of the market.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
In the US, they have over 60%, 68%, 60%,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
something like that.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
But I think the real problem is there's nowhere else to go.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Where do you go?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
There's literally one other option in the entire world.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
I mean, I know technically there's like some Kickstarter

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
that somebody could have like 100 other phones,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
but in practice, as an adult,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
you need a smartphone to live these days

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
to function in society.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Like, well, you get this app to do this thing.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Like, well, how do I get it on my phone?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
I have to hit, to get C, I press number one three times.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
I go, hey, you can't do this part of the world.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
You're done.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
And I think Apple, I think it's, I don't know.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
It's a little bit, it's a little bit

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
of a silly lawsuit in some senses.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
People don't really, the people writing the lawsuit

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
seem to be not very connected technically

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
or deeply understand the problems here.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
I think there's some really legitimate causes

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
and I'm here for this.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
I hope this makes a change

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
because Apple is just such a bully.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
I have had such insanely bad experiences

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
working with them, getting apps in the app store,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
which is crazy because you're like,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
I spent, me and Lauren spent months

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
writing the latest Talk Python app

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
to just try to make the iPhone a little bit better,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
to make people who wanna do our stuff

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
enjoy doing it more on the iPhone.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
They're like, nope, we're rejecting that.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
And we have these rules.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
We need more money from you,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
even though you're already paying us $100 a month

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
and making the platform better.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
For example, I'm sure people think I'm cranky about this,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
but I just wanna give a little background

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
for people who haven't heard me rant about this.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
We submitted it and they said,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
well, it doesn't have in-app purchases.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
I said, that's okay.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
I don't really want to sell anything through here.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
It's not like people are coming to the app

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
and then they're becoming,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
I just, this is for people who are already customers of mine,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
already taking courses.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
I just want them to be able to do that better.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Like, no, apps rejected.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
- Interesting.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
- But you have this clause, 4.3.1, called Reader Apps.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
It says, if you bought material on the web,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
like a book, audio, or video,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
you're allowed to consume that on the phone

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
and there's no in-app purchase required.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
We don't care.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
You don't count as that.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
You're something else.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
- You're not as big as Amazon, so you can't--

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
- Yeah, you don't get any special treatment.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
So what you're gonna do is you're gonna spend two weeks

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
for two people, full-time, developing the in-app purchase

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
so that you can sell a couple of courses a month,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
even though it costs you thousands and thousands

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
of dollars to do it, or you can't be part of this.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
The majority of your customers in the United States

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
can't have your app, right?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
And just that, we're going to, you know,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
grind it out on these little companies

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
to get a couple hundred bucks

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
and cost them tons of effort.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Now it's harder to maintain the app.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
If I add a new course, I've gotta like do more work

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
and release new versions of the app just because of that.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Like it's incredibly frustrating how they're just--

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
- Well, does this even talk about that?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Because when I read this, I was thinking,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
I was thinking, I mean, I've felt this.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
I love Apple.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
I've got two or three computers.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
I got the phone watch, but I've thought,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
hey, I want to try a different watch.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Oh, it doesn't work with anything else.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
I can't, I can't really.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
So I feel the customer lock-in part,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
I'm not really happy about that.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
But the other part that I, is that part,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
and I don't know if the lawsuit covers that,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
is this whole 30% tax that they want to apply.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
- I think, yeah, I think it does cover

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
the lack of ability of using other--

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
- Payment processors and stuff.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
- Other payment processing, other delivery methods,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
all that kind of stuff.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Like another really creepy thing that Apple's doing

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
is they're going to allow only the big companies

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
to install apps over the web directly

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
and use their own payment processor directly,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
but only in Europe and only for companies

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
that have had over a million downloads previously.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
So there's no way to get started ever.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
If you created a popular app now,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
you have to have done it last year.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
But if you don't have it yet, how do you?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
But then they're charging 27% for their fee

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
for delivering your app.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
But if they're not doing the processing

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
and it doesn't go over their servers,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
what is the 27% for again?

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
- Just to give them money.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
- It's bad.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
So anyway, there's a couple of videos

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
from this guy called Theo Rance.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
They're actually quite good,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
both the lawsuit and another one.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
And then also the day after, this was yesterday, Brian,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
the EU rejects Apple's European App Store changes.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
This is the one I just talked about

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
with some of those weird fees and other stuff, right?

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Company could be fined 10% of global revenue

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
and 20% if they don't fix it after that.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And so it's just one thing after another

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
coming down on this company that's just,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
they make 85% of their money off in-app purchases from games.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
They should just make the rest of it free

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
and not even make it a hassle for people.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
You know what I mean?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
It's just like, why are they doing all of these things

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
to just for that last little bit of stockholder value?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
- Yeah, but even the games part,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
why are they taking 30% cut?

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
It's just, it's too high.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
- Yeah, and honestly, I don't even mind the 30%.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
What I mind is that they say

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
that these kinds of apps can't exist

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
or your app has to be completely rewritten

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
so that you do start selling, even if you don't want to

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
or we won't accept it, right?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
If I wanted to sell it, I'd be like,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
all right, look, 30%, it's rough,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
but it's digital products, I'll live.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
But the fact they're like,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
you can't even choose to not sell stuff.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
We're going to make you sell stuff.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
And that kind of stuff is just,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
that's where I think like, okay, this is over the line.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
When it's that high of a percentage

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
and you treat people like that, it's bad news for us.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
That said, I have like five Apple devices

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
just in this room, so I'm very conflicted.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
- Yeah, definitely.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
- Yeah, yeah.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Okay, I have a few more things, they're quicker, I promise.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
The PSF is looking to hire somebody,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
which is awesome, for PyPI support specialists.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
How cool is that?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
- That is cool.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
- It's kind of nuts that all of PyPI,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
you think of the infrastructure,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
the amount of bandwidth flowing through that thing

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
and how much traffic there is in that website

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
and that there's nobody whose job is to keep it running.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
It's kind of nuts, but yeah, so a PyPI support specialist

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
is a job, a person that are looking to join the team.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
So if you're interested in that, check it out.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
That'd be really cool.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Let's see, why is this looking like it looks here?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
There we go.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
We're going to do, this needs to go away.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
I'm going to do a VS Code, ask me anything with Brian Clark,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
not Brian, I can, Brian Clark and Cecil Phillip

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
and me and 21 days.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
So if you want to be part of that YouTube only event,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
then the link is in the show notes, check that out.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
You can submit questions ahead of time.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
So if you've got one, please, please do that.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And lastly, a quick conference thing.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Gareth Thomas said, hey, just let you all know,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
PyData Eindhoven 2024 will take place on the 11th of July

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
and there's a call for proposals open.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
So if you're interested in that, check it out.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Okay, I've got one extra thing.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
>> You have an extra, extra.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
>> Extra, extra.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
And partly it's an apology.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
So I've been doing the emails for the show,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
but I kind of forgot last week.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
So this week you'll get two or we'll combine them

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
into one or something like that.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
But how do you get the email?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
So if you go to Python Bytes and click on friends,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
you can fill out your name there and get the show notes

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
into your inbox if you want.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
So plus we'll sell it and make lots of money.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
No, we don't sell your email or anything.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
>> We don't sell it.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
We don't even transfer it to other locations.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
It's pretty excellent.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
We've got some good infrastructure set up to just--

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
>> I don't even look at them.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Or if something goes wrong, do I bother looking?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
All right, well, let's wrap this up with a joke.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
>> Okay.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
>> So, you know, Windows,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
some of these different operating systems and ecosystems

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
have more certifications than others.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Like there's the network certifications

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
for network engineers and Windows has got a lot, right?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
So there's the Windows certified technician.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
It's a game.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
It's like a giant arcade that has the Windows on it.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
It says, "Can you make it work?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Can you make it work?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Can you battle your way through driver updates

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
and registry edits on your quest to defeat

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
the dreaded blue screen of death?"

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
And there's like a super excited guy with a toolbox

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
ready to take on the Windows blue screen of death

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
and hack the registry.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Can you be a Windows certified engineer?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
It's the latest-- it's the hottest game

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
of Dave and Buster's this year.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
>> Okay, but look at the controls.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
You've got to be a Windows engineer

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
with a trackpad and three buttons.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
>> You didn't notice?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Yeah, but look at the labels on the buttons.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
There's four buttons.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
You missed an important one.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
There's a big giant rollerball trackpad.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
What is that?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Trackball.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Then there's three buttons, Control, Alt, and Delete.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
But down at the bottom, there's another one

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
that says Reboot.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
It's like the bonus button.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
>> Yeah.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
That's good.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
>> I'll make this the chapter art.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
This is good.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
>> Yeah, awesome.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
All right, well, always fun.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Thanks for being here, Brian.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
>> Thank you.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
>> Yeah, thanks to everyone for listening.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Catch you all later.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
>> Bye.
