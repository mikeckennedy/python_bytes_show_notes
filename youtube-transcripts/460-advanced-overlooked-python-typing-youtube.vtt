00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Hello, hello.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Hey, Brian.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>How's it going?

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this might be a fine day to do a little bit of Python news.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:19.580
<v Speaker 1>We've been, presumably, fortified by an unreasonable amount of turkey and mashed potatoes over the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 1>last week.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>So we're ready.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Lots of pumpkin pie.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Lots of, you know what?

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>It was key lime pie and pumpkin cheesecake was on store for us.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.240
<v Speaker 1>So it was really good.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, let's kick it off, huh?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>This is episode 460, recorded, unbelievably, December 1st.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 2>And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And this episode is brought to you by us, especially Black Friday things that we have on offer.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>It's been a great Black Friday for me.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are really interested in the stuff that I put together, hopefully for you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.640
<v Speaker 1>as well, Brian.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I kind of forgot about Black Friday.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Well, the Black Friday has been going good.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 2>What I forgot about was Cyber Monday.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 2>So I did add today so people can use Cyber Monday code for the course today.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>But yeah, I just added that this morning.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Well, people can look for an email from me if they're signed up to the newsletters.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Is your stuff, what's yours through?

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Is it through today?

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to have it end just tomorrow morning.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>So in case people are like, oh, no, I always get emails like, I missed it by an hour.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Or just let it go another day and then turn it off.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 2>So if you're not watching this live, you're kind of SOL.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.680
<v Speaker 1>No, I mean, they can listen.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.700
<v Speaker 1>They can listen today.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Like this is timely news.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>People got to stay on top of Python bytes.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>They can't let it, can't let it accumulate.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>No, it's fine.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>If you listen backwards, there's a lot of stuff that's not that timely, but one of my topics

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>certainly is anyway.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>It's, that's going good.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Subscribe to the newsletter, follow us on the socials.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Make sure to subscribe here on YouTube as well.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.779
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in catching that, we intend the podcast to be an audio podcast, but while

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.980
<v Speaker 1>we're doing the live stream we do put stuff up on the screen and sometimes it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>helps to see it you know even though we do our best to keep it audio friendly

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah speaking of putting stuff on the screen what do you got for us Brian well

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 2>today is December 1st and that means that it's the first day of Advent of

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Code so I want that and I would to look to see how long this has been going on

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 2>and I guess I don't I'll have to look harder I don't know how long this has

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.800
<v Speaker 2>been going on.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 2>So what this is, it's code puzzles

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.120
<v Speaker 2>that you can do in any language.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.620
<v Speaker 2>The intent is to do them in any language.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.400
<v Speaker 2>But of course, our listeners are probably

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.240
<v Speaker 2>doing them in Python.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Rust this year.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.900
<v Speaker 2>But this is from--

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.360
<v Speaker 2>A simply as a stretch goal?

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Come on.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.340
<v Speaker 2>This is from Eric Wassel.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.220
<v Speaker 2>And I really appreciate it.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 2>This year's a couple changes.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.659
<v Speaker 2>There's no--

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Let's see, there's some 12 days.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.440
<v Speaker 2>And actually, I'm kind of grateful because I've never actually gotten through all 25.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.500
<v Speaker 2>And I might, or 24 or however many of them anywhere.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.840
<v Speaker 2>So I'm kind of grateful for a shorter one so I can take a couple days to try them out.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I might try this year.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 2>And what are the other couple changes?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 2>There's the Global Leaderboard has gone away for maintenance reasons.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.280
<v Speaker 2>So I do appreciate.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.360
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things is we should say thanks for people doing cool stuff.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 2>So, Adventic culture is cool. It is sponsored.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.500
<v Speaker 2>There are some sponsors that,  that have, 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.560
<v Speaker 2>helped keep this going. But,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.200
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I noticed this year and maybe it's been there and I just

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.760
<v Speaker 2>haven't noticed is there's,  a swag page.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 2>You can go look at their, look, some of the,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.240
<v Speaker 2>some cool stuff and you can grab a mug or shirt or,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.060
<v Speaker 2>you know, something kind of fun.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.560
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I kind of like about it is it's not,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.079
<v Speaker 2>there's the year isn't on there.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.480
<v Speaker 2>So this can be one that you can just,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 2>you can pull out and wear every year around Christmas.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Evergreen swag.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Like it.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.140
<v Speaker 2>So fun thing.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to hear if other people are using or,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.400
<v Speaker 2>or doing the Advent of code this year.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to hear about how it's going.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.460
<v Speaker 2>The what,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Another kind of associated with this, I saw this up on Reddit.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Somebody wrote a, I know there's been other helpers out there,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.640
<v Speaker 2>but there is a Python project that is called Elf,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.600
<v Speaker 2>which is a modern advent of code helper that fetches inputs,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 2>submits answers, and tracks your progress.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.020
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to link to that as well.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Just saw this.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh, they've been working on it for a few months,

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.800
<v Speaker 2>getting ready for it.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 2>So Elf is a command line interface to kind of play with the advent of code stuff.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 2>So we'll link to that as well.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, very cool.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.300
<v Speaker 1>The advent of code stuff is interesting,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.100
<v Speaker 1>but I've never really put much time and energy into it personally.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I just have so many projects that I have ideas for and I want to build,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>and I can't even focus on them.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's like, it is cool.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm personally thankful for surviving Hocktoberfest without 10 PRs suggesting that I put a comma in my readme.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Did you get any?

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 1>No, I used to get a bunch.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Like, hey, we've improved your readme.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's like, you're looking to do a PR is what you're looking to do.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 1>You're just wasting my time.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.680
<v Speaker 1>But actually, no, maybe people put up rules around it or they just put up admonishment.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:17.080
<v Speaker 1>please don't bother people like that but yeah not this year yeah cool um let's talk about uh django

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:26.020
<v Speaker 1>huh that's what i want to cover next yeah jaco and what's cool is django is coming up with um

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:34.060
<v Speaker 1>a major new release they're knocking out the versions pretty quickly and as i did point out

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.900
<v Speaker 1>at the opening. This is expected December 2025. So I'm expecting this any moment now, Brian.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.300
<v Speaker 1>But seriously, Django 6 has some really cool features, actually some genuinely useful ones.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.480
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I want to point out about it is how aggressive they are at saying no to older

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.280
<v Speaker 1>versions, like no old Python. They only support Python 3.12 and above. That's pretty hardcore,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.740
<v Speaker 1>honestly.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, but it's an application.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.500
<v Speaker 2>So you get to decide.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not like if you're building

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.300
<v Speaker 2>on top of Django, you have to

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.620
<v Speaker 2>support backwards

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.660
<v Speaker 2>compatible stuff.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, but you may

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>have a five-year-old Django app you want

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>to upgrade that has some weird dependency

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.700
<v Speaker 1>that goes up to 310.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this is a bad thing.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I think this is awesome.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of benefit that people are missing out.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Like when I did the year in review sort of thing article at JetBrains earlier this year,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 1>one of the areas I worked on and sort of did a bunch of math and predictions or stats on or whatever

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.640
<v Speaker 1>was this what version of Python are people running on.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.540
<v Speaker 1>And a huge bunch of people are still running on 310 or older.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 1>And your code is so much faster and uses less memory

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.680
<v Speaker 1>and just so much better.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Like, forget the new features that you get to use.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Just literally, it's like 50% faster or something

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 1>just by changing what version of Python you're running on.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>And this sort of encourages the Python people who also Django

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.300
<v Speaker 1>to ride further out on the edge of that wave, I suppose,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.580
<v Speaker 1>which is really good because it definitely helps.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>So 5.2 is the last one to support 3.10 and 3.11.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>So they dropped two years worth of Python in one year.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:38.419
<v Speaker 1>So features-- content security policy.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 1>We all do not love our cross-site scripting and other badnesses.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>So it comes now with a built-in support for the content security

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.860
<v Speaker 1>policy standard.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So that's cool to avoid CSS or XSS and those kind of things.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Just install it and configure it.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Basically, it sets some headers which then tell the web browsers

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.180
<v Speaker 1>how they're allowed to behave, cross-site, and that kind of thing.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Another one, I feel like this one probably has Carlton Gibson

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 1>fingerprints on it here, is they now have template partials.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.400
<v Speaker 1>This is super cool.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:24.460
<v Speaker 1>So I'm really surprised how much HTMX, the JavaScript

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.460
<v Speaker 1>where you front-end framework where you write no JavaScript

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing, is how popular it has become in Django.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.280
<v Speaker 1>It's featured in a lot of talks and stuff.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.580
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that you really, really need to focus on

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing that kind of programming

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.439
<v Speaker 1>is how do I take portions of my page

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.040
<v Speaker 1>and then return them from server-side code.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.300
<v Speaker 1>And you can end up with lots of duplication

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.540
<v Speaker 1>or other weirdnesses.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 1>So this basically addresses that.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.860
<v Speaker 1>If you want to return a fragment of a page,

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.560
<v Speaker 1>then you can say, I know here's the whole page,

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.960
<v Speaker 1>the whole template of HTML markup with Django syntax.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 1>But in this view, when somebody makes this request,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I want to return just this portion of it.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 1>And you can even do things like, is the request coming in

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.040
<v Speaker 1>a regular request?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Well, return the whole page.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:17.880
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Is it an HTMLX partial request?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Then just return the partial.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.540
<v Speaker 1>So this is really, really valuable

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.280
<v Speaker 1>and basically makes those kinds of frameworks that

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.180
<v Speaker 1>exchange partial bits of HTML, regardless of whether it's

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.240
<v Speaker 1>HTML, nicer.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.080
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Another really nice one is a background tasks.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.240
<v Speaker 1>So just a thread that cruises around in the background

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.340
<v Speaker 1>that you can throw stuff at.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Way more useful than you would think.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you want to process something

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Speaker 1>that takes a little bit longer, but you

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.600
<v Speaker 1>don't want to block up the request response.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Like, hey, I want to sign up for your newsletter.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Speaker 1>If you want to send them a welcome to my newsletter

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.360
<v Speaker 1>or whatever email, you could, on that request,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:11.440
<v Speaker 1>block, let it sit there and spin, fire up your email API,

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:14.860
<v Speaker 1>connect, send, wait for that actually to send,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.140
<v Speaker 1>get a response back, and then say, welcome,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.160
<v Speaker 1>we've sent you an email.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:19.960
<v Speaker 1>That's one way.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.600
<v Speaker 1>But that makes your code potentially slow.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 1>It'd be nice to go instantly, hey, thanks for signing up.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.360
<v Speaker 1>You're on the newsletter.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>And then kick off a task to the background,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Like, send that person an email.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.980
<v Speaker 1>For one email, it's not that big of a deal.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.860
<v Speaker 1>If you've got to send a lot or do a bunch of stuff,

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.580
<v Speaker 1>it can time out your web requests.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.640
<v Speaker 1>You get normally 20 seconds or something like that.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.540
<v Speaker 1>And if it takes longer than that, it's a problem.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Of course, people are going to be freaked out and reload

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 1>or whatever as well.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.560
<v Speaker 1>But anyway, this is a real simple way

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.980
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to run other servers and message

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>queues and all that kind of stuff.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.260
<v Speaker 1>You just put it in the background of your app and let it go.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not as durable.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's great.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Almost every app needs some sort of background task.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.380
<v Speaker 1>So this is awesome that it's included now.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.660
<v Speaker 1>It's cool that it's included.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of email, email handling in Django now uses the Python's modern API

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.400
<v Speaker 1>introduced in 3.6 using email.message.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Email message.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Super cool.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Easier to send that way.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And then a bunch of minor features that I'm not going to go into.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, that's a pretty big set of releases or features for a year.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, so now we have to see how many people are going to update all of their Django books and tutorials and everything to do Django 6.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.720
<v Speaker 1>It's both an opportunity and a bit of a challenge.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, so Django's not a, that isn't just a year though, is it?

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't there is Lee cycle like a year and a half or two years or something like that?

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.820
<v Speaker 1>i feel like where's the release here we go

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:11.540
<v Speaker 1>it's yearly yeah it's early i think okay well yeah hold on me but it depends on what you call

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 1>like what is the version bump it's there is a release every year but it's not always a major

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.920
<v Speaker 1>version bump like six is coming but then six one and six two are planned and i think

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.100
<v Speaker 1>6.2 might be the LTS.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.580
<v Speaker 1>So it bumps between LTSs,

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 1>and the LTSs are on a three-year cycle,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.080
<v Speaker 1>long-term support.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 1>So you're not forced to keep rolling

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.200
<v Speaker 1>to get security fixes and stuff.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's because of some deprecation stuff

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.080
<v Speaker 2>and everything.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.260
<v Speaker 2>All right.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Cool.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Got to love advancements in Django.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Well, I'm going to take a look at some typing stuff.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:54.440
<v Speaker 2>How does that sound?

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I love typing.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.920
<v Speaker 2>So there's an article called Advanced Overlooked Python Typing.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.880
<v Speaker 2>And there's some goodies in here that I didn't know about, which is cool.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.860
<v Speaker 2>So I was slow to come on board with typing, but I like all of the extra.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of a fan now.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Plus, it only takes having one package that's kind of popular that people will demand that you have typing.

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:28.680
<v Speaker 2>So anyway, so some of the some cool, cool extra things if you you possibly may not have known about.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:36.120
<v Speaker 2>The first I'll jump into is, oh, there's a disclaimer here that it says that the it's looking at modern stuff.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 2>So Python 312 or 313 or newer.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.980
<v Speaker 2>So for some of this stuff.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.340
<v Speaker 2>So assert never, I didn't know this was a thing.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:52.420
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you've got a match case thing like switches.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.660
<v Speaker 2>And you've got your catch all at the end and you want to never hit that.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Usually I'll throw an assert there or something just in case.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.660
<v Speaker 2>But there's an assert never that comes from typing.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Didn't know that was there that you can make sure that this default case has never hit.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.300
<v Speaker 2>or if you have other cases that should never be hit,

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.860
<v Speaker 2>you can throw that in there.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:18.480
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Didn't know that existed.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.000
<v Speaker 2>There's getargs, and the idea around getargs is,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 2>this is a little small,

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.460
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to see if I can make this a little bigger.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.280
<v Speaker 2>The idea around getargs is,

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 2>so if you've got, like,

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.140
<v Speaker 2>here we've got frozen sets to have literals.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:52.240
<v Speaker 2>There's literals before, but you kind of had to have a duplication of all the actual literals for typing for different things.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's in a set of literals, and that's sort of a pain.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 2>So instead of that, you can do get args, which creates essentially a set of literals for types, for things that are in something.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.460
<v Speaker 2>So you kind of have to see the code here to understand that.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:24.360
<v Speaker 2>But it helps with keeping it in line so that when you create an extra element in your set, it automatically gets an extra type.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.860
<v Speaker 2>TypeGuard we've covered before.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.160
<v Speaker 2>I think we've covered it.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 2>It gets you the exact type-narrowing logic.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I haven't used TypeGuard a lot.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 2>But there's sort of a pickier version.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:46.420
<v Speaker 2>type is a stricter and more prophesied type narrowing than type guard by enabling bidirectional

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:56.180
<v Speaker 2>narrowing okay so um kind of fun with uh type is anyway some uh some extra oh we've got

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:03.240
<v Speaker 2>unpacking and concatenation for callables oh callable with dot dot anyway a lot of goodies

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.759
<v Speaker 2>for if you want to like really get into some of the nitty-gritty and some of the extra extra fun

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:13.780
<v Speaker 1>things with typing. This is a fun article. Yeah, very nice. I actually have an interesting

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:21.100
<v Speaker 1>one to add to that is no return. Oh, really? Okay. So you can go to a function and you can say

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:30.260
<v Speaker 1>arrow, I mean, goes to int, goes to stir, goes to optional customer, whatever. You can even say

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.180
<v Speaker 1>it returns none, which is literally it returns none.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.760
<v Speaker 1>But no return is-- it's not like a void.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.540
<v Speaker 1>It's different.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.640
<v Speaker 1>It basically says the only way that this function exits

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.240
<v Speaker 1>is through an exception.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no way out of it.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.360
<v Speaker 1>So you might have a while application is still running,

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.380
<v Speaker 1>and then in some case, if it decides it needs to stop,

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.660
<v Speaker 1>it raises an aborted--

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.140
<v Speaker 1>task aborted exception.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's like, while true, if exit, raise taskable.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Like, there's no regular way out.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.120
<v Speaker 1>The only way out is through an exception than this.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.680
<v Speaker 1>So you might think, why would I ever do that?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Well, some of the web frameworks, when you do a redirect,

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.280
<v Speaker 1>the way they do the redirect is they raise an HTTP redirect

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.980
<v Speaker 1>sort of exception type thing,

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:24.060
<v Speaker 1>which is more likely to just, like, make it get all the way out right away

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 1>rather than if you forget to, say, return redirect.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:33.460
<v Speaker 2>something like that so you'd put a no return there isn't that a weird one yeah yeah so i would have

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:41.240
<v Speaker 2>expected uh like um one of the commenters i thought no return was equivalent equivalent to return none

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:47.620
<v Speaker 2>so if you don't know what it means i'm like oh this is a really cool way to say it only returns

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.979
<v Speaker 1>none ever which is the case if you never if you don't say the keyword return it still returns none

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.940
<v Speaker 1>But no, this says the only way it gets out is through exceptions.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Huh.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, it was weird, right?

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Typing module annotate functions that never return normally.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I wanted a void.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Where's my void?

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.440
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Like, there's nothing coming out of this.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 1>This is not it, but this is like, this is something else in that realm of a dance type.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, and those things do exist.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.040
<v Speaker 2>So, yeah.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.060
<v Speaker 1>They sure do.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.940
<v Speaker 1>So, you know what else exists is misspellings.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.740
<v Speaker 1>So I got on my Talk Python in production book,

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Christian Klaus was kind enough to send me a message saying,

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.720
<v Speaker 1>hey, you know, so you may have some misspellings.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.160
<v Speaker 1>And he sent me this thing, right, as a PR.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 1>However, it says fixed typos discovered by code spell.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.660
<v Speaker 1>All one word, code spell.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Wait, what is this code spell?

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Well, code spell is a tool that checks for common misspellings in source code.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:59.100
<v Speaker 1>It works on other files as well, but it especially works on different types of source files

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:07.960
<v Speaker 1>because it ignores backslash escapes and other things that are common in code.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.580
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a spell checker.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a misspelling finder, let's say.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.660
<v Speaker 1>So what it does is it goes and it says, I'm going to look for words that are commonly misspelled.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Like in my example, what two things had high misspelled.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I had FOM instead of from FOM and I had plausible with able instead of IBLE on it. Right. So it

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:37.040
<v Speaker 1>looks for common misspellings. It doesn't look for words. It doesn't know because those are super

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.120
<v Speaker 1>annoying. You're like, here's 723 misspellings. Like, no, those are acronyms. You know what I mean?

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:48.639
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. like that is a library I'm importing. It's not misspelled. If I change it, it doesn't

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.560
<v Speaker 1>work, right?

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of stuff.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.760
<v Speaker 1>So what this does is it looks for like common misspellings

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 1>like ADN or TEH or what, you know, stuff like that.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, there's not a whole lot more to say about it other than

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.300
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty cool, it's configurable,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.060
<v Speaker 1>you can like put words that are, you know,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.040
<v Speaker 1>learn this spelling equivalents and put other types of config

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.700
<v Speaker 1>files and whatnot.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh, this is cool.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.120
<v Speaker 1>You can even put it into a pyproject.toml.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.200
<v Speaker 1>settings if you wish.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, it's got 2,300 GitHub stars.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.900
<v Speaker 1>So yeah, pretty popular actually.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.520
<v Speaker 2>As somebody that uses a code editor exclusively for all of my text writing

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.220
<v Speaker 2>needs, this will be good.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, indeed.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I think Christian even set it up as a pre-commit hook.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a good idea.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.720
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of interesting because it's apparently pretty fast.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the one we were talking about.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, there's something about pre-commit right there in the last commit,

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.060
<v Speaker 1>so I'm guessing it does something with that.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:58.640
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.800
<v Speaker 1>How are you feeling on your extras?

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I got a few extras.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, go for it.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll start with Hatch.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.460
<v Speaker 2>So Hatch 1.16 came out.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.980
<v Speaker 2>So some exciting features of Hatch.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:29.020
<v Speaker 2>So for Hatch backends and Hatch itself, what do we got?

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.100
<v Speaker 2>We got dependency groups, and there are workspaces.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.019
<v Speaker 2>So workspaces allow you to have, like if you have a monorepo

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.840
<v Speaker 2>and you have a bunch of different projects within a monorepo,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.460
<v Speaker 2>this might help with that.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.820
<v Speaker 2>And then there's, well, this is interesting.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.120
<v Speaker 2>It supports software bill of materials now.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.780
<v Speaker 2>So that's becoming a growing thing.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.340
<v Speaker 2>So update to Hatch.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.480
<v Speaker 2>And another update on a different project we talked about last week.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Was it last week?

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.940
<v Speaker 2>We talked about one of the things we talked about was Zensicle.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:12.839
<v Speaker 2>And a listener over on Mastodon, Fasodon, said one of the things we forgot to mention

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:19.020
<v Speaker 2>is Zensicle is a replacement for MakeDocs plus material theme.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.620
<v Speaker 2>And also one of the things they talked about was MakeDocs

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.760
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem like it's been maintained since the middle of 2024.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.740
<v Speaker 2>So there's a link in here to is MakeDocs still maintained?

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.880
<v Speaker 2>And I scrolled.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.300
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting read,

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:46.440
<v Speaker 2>But I kind of think the answer is maybe-ish, but maybe not.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.280
<v Speaker 2>So if you are...

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.800
<v Speaker 1>You always have to split that difference of like, it could just be done.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.780
<v Speaker 1>You know, certain things are just, they really don't need more and they're supposed to be simple.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:05.440
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like MKDocs is something that could continually take on new variations and features and updates.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.980
<v Speaker 2>So not even to say no, we're not longer being maintained.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Is this the past?

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Anyway, interesting read if you're curious and want to depend on that.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.800
<v Speaker 2>But I think I'll be checking out Zensicle as well.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.280
<v Speaker 1>And as you pointed out last week, I think you said,

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.360
<v Speaker 1>for sure, it's a rewrite.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Zensicle is not just building on MKDocs.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.420
<v Speaker 1>It's just the people that were working on material for MKDocs

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.320
<v Speaker 1>are now building a completely from scratch documentation thing, right?

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, it's backwards compatible if you used MKDocs before,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.140
<v Speaker 2>but it is something completely different.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:49.780
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.800
<v Speaker 1>All right, do you have any extras?

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.620
<v Speaker 1>For something completely different?

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I do.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to, was it last week or week before?

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I talked about TACH, T-A-C-H,

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.740
<v Speaker 1>and how it creates one of those basically architectural layered graphs

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.380
<v Speaker 1>that let you show which parts of your app depend upon which other parts of your app,

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.060
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:17.240
<v Speaker 1>And it was pointed out that, hey, hey, that thing looks kind of unmaintained.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Well, Gerber Decker sent me a message and says,

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.900
<v Speaker 1>TAC has been unmaintained for a bit, but it's not anymore.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.020
<v Speaker 1>It was the main project of Gage, which is a Y Combinator startup

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.700
<v Speaker 1>that pivoted to something unrelated and based on AI.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Surprise, surprise.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.680
<v Speaker 1>And they abandoned TAC.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 1>However, detached head from GitHub forked it

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.260
<v Speaker 1>and now has access to the main repo

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.720
<v Speaker 1>and has committed to maintaining it.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.740
<v Speaker 1>So it's back.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Also, rough analyzed graph.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.760
<v Speaker 1>It is fully independent of TAC.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.940
<v Speaker 1>And they actually looked into using that as an alternative

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.360
<v Speaker 1>once it became unmaintained.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:50.640
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, that's...

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.140
<v Speaker 1>TAC is back.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.780
<v Speaker 1>TAC is back.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:56.880
<v Speaker 1>TAC is back.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Also, quick shout out to Doug Farrell.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:02.100
<v Speaker 1>And thanks.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.480
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a review of my book.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.960
<v Speaker 1>And yeah, very nice.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.580
<v Speaker 1>So I linked over to that if people are interested.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Thank you, Doug, for writing that.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.380
<v Speaker 1>TLDR says recommended.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.240
<v Speaker 1>So appreciate that.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Are we ready to joke about something?

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so you've heard of platform as a service, P-A-A-S.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:38.900
<v Speaker 1>You've heard about infrastructure as a service, I-A-A-S, D-B-A-S, D-B-A-S.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes though, your productivity just demands that you stay focused

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.800
<v Speaker 1>and you just say no, right, Brian?

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.660
<v Speaker 1>So I present to you no SService.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:00.880
<v Speaker 1>So this is an API that will simply return a random but realistic excuse for saying no.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.140
<v Speaker 1>So you can turn it down in style.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh, nice.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Built by humans, excuses, and humor.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.660
<v Speaker 1>This project is sponsored by Git ads.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Git ads, I don't know what that is.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.700
<v Speaker 1>But anyway, so if you pull it up, it's N-A-A-S.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's N-O-A-S, but whatever.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.140
<v Speaker 1>That's not the domain they got.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.900
<v Speaker 1>And you just get a little bit of JSON.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Reason, I'm finding an invisible dragon at home.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.680
<v Speaker 1>It's taking longer than expected.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Or, not my circus, not my monkey, so definitely not my act to perform.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Cinderella left one shoe here, and I need to help her find it instead of going out.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I would come, but I'm trying this new thing where I just don't.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.440
<v Speaker 1>So if you need to integrate no for whatever reason into your application,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.340
<v Speaker 1>well, here's the API right here.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.180
<v Speaker 1>You get a JSON response.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.960
<v Speaker 2>It is built as an API.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:53.880
<v Speaker 2>This is great.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.400
<v Speaker 2>You can just query it.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, we're going to get probably an MCP built over as well.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.440
<v Speaker 1>So you can integrate it into your AI workflow as well.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it's going to be powerful.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Why use a constant when you can call an API?

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, I thought no as a service is a pretty good joke.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.920
<v Speaker 2>I love this last one

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I would come but I'm trying this new thing

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 2>where I just don't

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:20.240
<v Speaker 2>exactly

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.040
<v Speaker 2>my favorite is I can't make it

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.060
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.380
<v Speaker 2>exactly

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:28.120
<v Speaker 1>no

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.200
<v Speaker 1>don't want to

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.340
<v Speaker 1>all right well

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.580
<v Speaker 1>fun episode as always

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.400
<v Speaker 1>thank you everyone for listening

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.060
<v Speaker 1>thanks Brian

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.340
<v Speaker 1>thank you

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.620
<v Speaker 1>bye
