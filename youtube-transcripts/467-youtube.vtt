<v Michael Kennedy>Hey.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Ready to do another podcast?

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Michael Kennedy>That'd be fun.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.800

<v Michael Kennedy>And it tells you when we're going to show next time.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, they can even check out a glimpse of the Python staff of power just behind you there.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's right.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, there it is.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and I'm still on the fence about going to PyCon this year,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.520
<v Michael Kennedy>and if I go to PyCon, I'll definitely bring the staff of power.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.160
<v Brian Okken>My fence has been built and decided upon.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Brian Okken>I bought my tickets, and I got actually a pretty amazing deal on Expedia.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Brian Okken>I was able to get four days hotel right near a block or two from the convention center and the water and a round trip flight for 600 bucks total.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Brian Okken>So I'm going.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, nice.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm just trying to, I'm going to try to ask work if I can take, get away with not having to take vacation time to go.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.000
<v Brian Okken>Wouldn't that be nice?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.560
<v Brian Okken>Hey, they talk about pie tests there.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.660
<v Brian Okken>I know you're doing a lot with that.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Brian Okken>So.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.680
<v Brian Okken>All right.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Brian Okken>Well, should we do some topics for the show?

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Brian Okken>Let's talk.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Brian Okken>Oh, I have the toad up.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Brian Okken>That is not what I want to talk about.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Brian Okken>I want to talk about this thing called the Gray Noise IP Check.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.380
<v Brian Okken>Okay?

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Brian Okken>So Gray Noise is a company that does research on cybersecurity breaches,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Brian Okken>et cetera, et cetera, right?

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Brian Okken>So they have published this thing called the Gray Noise IP Check.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Brian Okken>And if you just go to check.labs.greynoise.io or way simpler, click the link in the show notes,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Brian Okken>it will take you to this place that says your IP address is whatever your IP address is.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Brian Okken>And your IP address is clean.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Brian Okken>Your IP has not been observed scanning the internet or contained in the common business services data set.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.920
<v Brian Okken>So what is this for?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Brian Okken>Like in the day of 30 things connected to your internet, your Wi-Fi,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.800
<v Brian Okken>with your kids installing random junk off the internet,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.780
<v Brian Okken>like my kid is pretty good, she says,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Brian Okken>Dad, is it okay if I install this?

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.560
<v Brian Okken>Yes, it's okay or no.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Brian Okken>And she actually completely reformatted her Windows 11 machine

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.660
<v Brian Okken>so she could play games but not worry about what was installed on it.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Brian Okken>So, you know, not knocking the kid or anything.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.900
<v Brian Okken>But kids install stuff, other people install stuff,

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Brian Okken>Your TV, your smart power thing that goes to that lamp in the corner.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.080
<v Brian Okken>There's a crap ton of stuff that is on your network.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Brian Okken>And even if you run some sort of virus check on your computer,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.360
<v Brian Okken>having that come up empty doesn't mean that there's not a problem

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Brian Okken>with things that you are in control of, right?

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.820
<v Brian Okken>So basically, the idea of this thing is you can go here,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.540
<v Brian Okken>and it will tell you if something on your network has been being bad.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.800
<v Brian Okken>Yeah?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.600
<v Brian Okken>and I don't know for me I thought that was pretty cool so I threw it in as one

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.980
<v Brian Okken>of the topics so that other people can click on this and see I guess a couple

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Brian Okken>caveats if your IP address just changed recently it's very plausible that you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.860
<v Brian Okken>could get a warning and it was whoever had it before you know what I mean like

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.279
<v Brian Okken>we had a power outage for just a couple hours some sort of I think I talked

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Brian Okken>about this last time because my mic had gotten all resets because everything got

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Brian Okken>powered 100% down because some sort of transformer thing exploded. We got a new

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.100
<v Brian Okken>IP address from then, right? But, you know, a couple weeks ago and so it turns out

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Brian Okken>that I guess things are still good. That's good to know. But if you just had your IP

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.140
<v Brian Okken>address changed then it could be picking up issues from whoever had it before,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.860
<v Brian Okken>right? Kind of like you keep getting spam with that new phone number you got. Yeah,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:15.360
<v Brian Okken>But these, I don't know about you, but my IP address is pretty much rock solid stable unless something goes wrong with the internet or with power that it may change.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.820
<v Brian Okken>But other than that, it's the same for quite a while.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm slightly embarrassed to say I usually don't know my IP address.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.340
<v Michael Kennedy>And I actually don't quite get how, I mean, I get how IP addresses work.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.140
<v Michael Kennedy>But like for a house, is your whole house like the same IP address?

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know how that works.

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Also, can you use this if you're at a cafe to check to see if there's other bad actors there?

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.820
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I guess you probably could, actually.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.160
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Interesting.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, I'll have to check it out.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.340
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, and I know more because I have a lot of my stuff gated behind IP addresses, like the server.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.860
<v Brian Okken>You can't even SSH to the server unless your IP address is on a whitelist.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.560
<v Brian Okken>So periodically when it changes, I'm like, oh, what is my IP address again?

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.060
<v Brian Okken>So then I go copy.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.240
<v Brian Okken>I don't really pay too much attention, but because of that,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.000
<v Brian Okken>I kind of got to pay a little attention.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm like a very data in the cloud sort of person.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Brian Okken>Perfect.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.640
<v Brian Okken>All right.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.080
<v Brian Okken>Well, I'm very excited about this next topic that you have

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.400
<v Brian Okken>because I also saw and said, that is killer.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.060
<v Brian Okken>Love it.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.960
<v Michael Kennedy>It is killer.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.280
<v Michael Kennedy>So what we're talking about is TPROF.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.000
<v Michael Kennedy>This is from, or TPROF?

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.960
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it's TPROF.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Michael Kennedy>It's the targeting profiler from Adam Johnson.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Michael Kennedy>And we've got a link to the PyPA site.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.460
<v Michael Kennedy>But it just mostly says, yeah, it's a targeting profiler.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.240
<v Michael Kennedy>But we're also going to link to his article introducing it,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.099
<v Michael Kennedy>introducing TPROF, a targeting profiler.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.140
<v Michael Kennedy>So, yeah, so it almost speaks for itself.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:11.500
<v Michael Kennedy>What he's talking about is if you run a profiler on your program, it gives you everything.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.800
<v Michael Kennedy>And you do.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:26.940
<v Michael Kennedy>You want to do that at first to see all the hot spots, where are you spending your time, and that's what you use profilers for, to see where you maybe could optimize some of your code.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.680
<v Michael Kennedy>But once you've pinpointed what you want to try to fix, then you want to try to measure that.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:41.320
<v Michael Kennedy>And you kind of have to do, and his pain point was running it over the whole program again and again and again.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And you don't really need to.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.740
<v Michael Kennedy>So his is a targeting profiler.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.980
<v Michael Kennedy>And you give it exactly the function that you're caring about or the functions multiple.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Michael Kennedy>And it will report what the times are, like the min and max and stuff.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:01.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And then he went further and said, there's a lot of times where you're just going to want to do like a before and after function.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:11.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And it probably won't be before and after, but you can like my search routine old and my search routine new or something like that.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Michael Kennedy>And you can have those be targeted and run the results and compare those.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.400
<v Brian Okken>Nice. It's like a showdown, right?

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.420
<v Brian Okken>Instead of trying to remember the results, you just say, here's the old way, here's the new way.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.200
<v Brian Okken>how'd that turn out, right?

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.620
<v Michael Kennedy>And he's kind of got two ways to do it.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.020
<v Michael Kennedy>You can do like a, well, so you can do the,

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.440
<v Michael Kennedy>pass the functions that you want to look at

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Michael Kennedy>on the command line.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.400
<v Michael Kennedy>So you don't even have to actually change anything

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.560
<v Michael Kennedy>in your code to do this.

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:44.000
<v Michael Kennedy>You can just target a couple of functions

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.940
<v Michael Kennedy>and call those.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.460
<v Michael Kennedy>And then, but you can also do a dash X for a compare

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Michael Kennedy>and it'll do a delta time, like a percent faster

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.380
<v Michael Kennedy>or a percent slower, which is pretty cool.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Or you can not have to do the command line thing too much

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.700
<v Michael Kennedy>and just do as a context manager.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.840
<v Michael Kennedy>You can say which ones you're going to compare

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.180
<v Michael Kennedy>and run those before and after with tprof.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.840
<v Michael Kennedy>All those are, I probably use all of those

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.280
<v Michael Kennedy>at different times, but I'm really excited to try this

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.380
<v Michael Kennedy>to optimize some code that I've been working on.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.900
<v Brian Okken>So it's pretty neat.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.420
<v Brian Okken>Apparently, this is the new Python 3.12 profiling API, which is really nice.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.860
<v Brian Okken>So a little using the modern lower touch profiler as well.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:33.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:39.320
<v Michael Kennedy>So, of course, you have to run it with 3.12 or above.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Michael Kennedy>But that doesn't mean that the code that you're testing against is necessarily just 3.12 and above.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.820
<v Michael Kennedy>It's just when you're running it, it'll be 3.12.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Brian Okken>You know what?

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Brian Okken>3.12 is almost obsolete.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Brian Okken>I'm serious.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.440
<v Brian Okken>Like, how insane is that?

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:55.880
<v Brian Okken>What?

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.460
<v Brian Okken>I mean, 3.10 is the oldest that is even allowed.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Brian Okken>Like, 3.9 has gone into, like, we don't even do security patches anymore.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:05.980
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.380
<v Brian Okken>That's true.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Brian Okken>3.10 is on the shadow, and then, like, it's two years till I let things go on.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Brian Okken>So it's not that old.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.720
<v Brian Okken>I mean, it's not that big of a stretch.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.460
<v Michael Kennedy>We don't even mention 2.7 anymore, the legacy.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.520
<v Brian Okken>So good.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.760
<v Brian Okken>So good to be past those days, right?

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:31.600
<v Brian Okken>I would also like to point out that this is just so good for profiling any real application, like any real application.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:43.340
<v Brian Okken>Because so much of what happens if you just see profile my particular app is all the time spent loading modules,

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:49.000
<v Brian Okken>all the time connecting to the database and just all of that, you know, setting up the log and that all,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.980
<v Brian Okken>Like all the stuff that happens before you get to the one function,

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Brian Okken>you want to see what's going on, and then it stops.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.400
<v Brian Okken>And you're like, the thing only takes 50 milliseconds.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.060
<v Brian Okken>But I've got profiling for like two seconds.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Brian Okken>And what is going on?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Brian Okken>It's just so lost in the noise.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.780
<v Brian Okken>And then this one, you can just say, run it.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.800
<v Brian Okken>Just ignore all that junk.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.480
<v Brian Okken>When you get to this function, start.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.800
<v Brian Okken>When you're done with the function, stop.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.640
<v Brian Okken>You know what I mean?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and that's actually, oh, that part of it's overwhelming to me.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Every time I've had to reach, I don't have to, you know, it's like a lot of debugging tools.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.980
<v Michael Kennedy>You don't have to reach for them all the time.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.760
<v Michael Kennedy>But when you do, it's a little overwhelming to look at all that profiling output.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.020
<v Michael Kennedy>And I still haven't got my head around flame graphs, but, you know.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:35.880
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:36.820
<v Brian Okken>Catch them.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.760
<v Brian Okken>They're hot.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:44.360
<v Brian Okken>No, honestly, like the fact you just say, just profile this function and that actually happens on the CLI,

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Brian Okken>my profiling is back, baby.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Brian Okken>like it's just I'm like is it really worth trying to dig through all that overhead and junk and

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Brian Okken>decide like probably no but now maybe maybe it really is thanks yeah thank you adam and then

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:03.660
<v Brian Okken>one more thing is like a lot of times some things are slower the very very first time they run

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:11.599
<v Brian Okken>so it might be worth writing a function that actually like runs it a bunch of times or

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Brian Okken>runs it once before you get to it and then profile it.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.260
<v Brian Okken>You know what I mean?

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.900
<v Brian Okken>Because it might be the module loading

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Brian Okken>that actually overwhelms the compute,

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.660
<v Brian Okken>but that only happens once.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.840
<v Brian Okken>Do I see a compilation?

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.800
<v Michael Kennedy>The context manager one would be great for that then.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.060
<v Michael Kennedy>You could call both the new and the old function once

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.220
<v Michael Kennedy>and then do a loop and do like 100 times

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.820
<v Michael Kennedy>to the other two.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.860
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, that would be totally perfect.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.880
<v Brian Okken>That would be really, really good.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.740
<v Brian Okken>You know what we don't talk enough about, though, Brian?

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Brian Okken>Honestly.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:46.620
<v Brian Okken>I mean.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Brian Okken>What?

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:47.660
<v Brian Okken>Toads.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.160
<v Brian Okken>Let's talk about toads.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Michael Kennedy>I know.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Michael Kennedy>And we live in Oregon.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.620
<v Michael Kennedy>We got them all over the place.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.540
<v Brian Okken>We do.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.040
<v Brian Okken>We do got them all over the place.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Or frogs, at least.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know if we have toads.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:57.800
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.480
<v Brian Okken>You know what?

00:12:59.600 --> 00:12:59.820
<v Brian Okken>Rocket.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:00.140
<v Brian Okken>No.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.260
<v Brian Okken>I'm sorry.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.820
<v Brian Okken>My dog is going crazy over there.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.960
<v Brian Okken>We're going to maybe have to drag her out of here.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.760
<v Brian Okken>So with toad, this comes from Will McGugan.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.560
<v Brian Okken>And it's kind of his next big thing

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.240
<v Brian Okken>that he's been working on since Textual.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Brian Okken>And the idea is it's kind of like a UI for Claude Code type

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:23.460
<v Brian Okken>things.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.620
<v Brian Okken>It actually works with something called OpenHands.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.760
<v Brian Okken>It works with Claude Code.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.860
<v Brian Okken>It works with Gemini CLI, probably others

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.840
<v Brian Okken>that I don't know about.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Brian Okken>When I first saw this, I'm like, OK, well,

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.940
<v Brian Okken>I already have a terminal.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.880
<v Brian Okken>I can do this.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.980
<v Brian Okken>I'm not really entirely sure what I need this for.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.460
<v Brian Okken>But the more I looked into it, it looks really quite neat.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Brian Okken>So if you go through, it obviously renders pictures.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.480
<v Brian Okken>Apparently not there.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.220
<v Brian Okken>It renders pictures.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.520
<v Brian Okken>Like one of the pictures is the Mandelbrot set drawn.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.240
<v Brian Okken>Cool.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.540
<v Brian Okken>And it has really nice, basically better input.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.880
<v Brian Okken>One of the challenges with things like Claude Code and Friends

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Brian Okken>is you're just in the terminal.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:11.440
<v Brian Okken>So can you use the mouse to select part of your text and cut it?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.880
<v Brian Okken>No, it's the terminal, right?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.120
<v Brian Okken>The arrow keys work right and all those kinds of things.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.960
<v Brian Okken>So it has a really nice, I'll just put this little video in the background while it's going here.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.600
<v Brian Okken>If I can get it to play and it doesn't want to play.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Brian Okken>Well, it has a really nice input for that kind of behavior, right?

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.520
<v Brian Okken>has a nice little web server that runs.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.020
<v Brian Okken>Let's see.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.220
<v Brian Okken>I've got a few more.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.360
<v Brian Okken>It uses fuzzy search, so something you do all the time

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.300
<v Brian Okken>or should do all the time, and if you're not,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.540
<v Brian Okken>you're totally missing out, is adding files

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.160
<v Brian Okken>of specific context to what you're working on.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.800
<v Brian Okken>So you might say, hey, I'd like to work on the login page.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.820
<v Brian Okken>page, and here are the notes that I--

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.140
<v Brian Okken>use the notes that I took.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.420
<v Brian Okken>How well is it going to work?

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:09.940
<v Brian Okken>We don't know.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.940
<v Brian Okken>You could say, I'd like to work on @login.html,

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.940
<v Brian Okken>and please see @loginrequirements.md.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.320
<v Brian Okken>And that will actually pop up a select.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.960
<v Brian Okken>And so this uses really nice fuzzy search and UI

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.180
<v Brian Okken>dropdowns in the terminal.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.280
<v Brian Okken>It says better prompt input.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Brian Okken>It uses-- it has support for terminals within terminals.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.560
<v Brian Okken>So if you ask it to run a command that

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.480
<v Brian Okken>is like complex terminal output, it will actually embed that,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Brian Okken>which is really sweet.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.480
<v Brian Okken>So people should give this a look.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.460
<v Brian Okken>I think it's pretty nice.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.160
<v Brian Okken>PIP install, I believe.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.700
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm going to check it out.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.320
<v Brian Okken>No, curl.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.660
<v Brian Okken>Curl install it.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.320
<v Brian Okken>Get it?

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.380
<v Brian Okken>That's the new way, right?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.460
<v Brian Okken>UV is showing us the way, but you can also uv tool install it if you prefer.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.200
<v Brian Okken>And that's probably the way I would install it because I already have scripts

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.540
<v Brian Okken>that basically manage all of my uv tools, check for updates and so on.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:22.720
<v Brian Okken>So check out Toad if you're doing like CLI, cloud code-like things.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:23.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:24.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Cool.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:25.660
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Batra chain.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Batra chain.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.240
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:37.600
<v Michael Kennedy>The girl is pulling it from a URL called B-A-T-R-A-C-H-I-A-N.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.900
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, that's where he's got it.

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.660
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, that's him.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:44.620
<v Brian Okken>Nice.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:45.600
<v Brian Okken>Cool.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.120
<v Brian Okken>You've even got your animated Zoom.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.840
<v Brian Okken>Oh, yeah, it's got the codex as well,

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.940
<v Brian Okken>a Mr. Unified experience for your terminal.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.260
<v Brian Okken>Nice.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, so this is, I don't know how this relates back to Toad,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.880
<v Brian Okken>But it must in ways that I don't know.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:02.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Well done.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:03.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Well done, Will.

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:06.319
<v Michael Kennedy>It was the inkblot.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.079
<v Michael Kennedy>What do you see here?

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.819
<v Michael Kennedy>I see a toad.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:08.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.579
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, I want to talk about something that's sort of AI related as well.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:20.720
<v Michael Kennedy>So FastAPI just made, I'm linking to a merge request,

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:24.079
<v Michael Kennedy>and we'll link to the actual page too.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.300
<v Michael Kennedy>But in the contributing to FastAPI page,

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.960
<v Michael Kennedy>there was a new change to talk about contribution instructions

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.100
<v Michael Kennedy>about LLM-generated code and comments

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.680
<v Michael Kennedy>and automated tools for PRs.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.840
<v Michael Kennedy>So I'm guessing that all FastAPI at least,

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.560
<v Michael Kennedy>but probably all very popular projects,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.940
<v Michael Kennedy>are having a problem with people doing PRs

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.480
<v Michael Kennedy>that they really haven't spent that much time on the PR,

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.260
<v Michael Kennedy>but they want to get their name in or something.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:54.760
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:02.200
<v Michael Kennedy>but um but there's there's some really good highlight here and it's not so i'm bringing

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:09.440
<v Michael Kennedy>this up not just because of um uh because of fast api is awesome and it is but it's a just sort of

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.200
<v Michael Kennedy>an interesting thing that we're having these uh sort of discussions and this is a nice concise

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.240
<v Michael Kennedy>uh verbiage if you want to add some of this pros to your own project to say what is allowed and

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.660
<v Michael Kennedy>what's not um there's and it's so we'll link to the contributing guideline developing contributing

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.720
<v Michael Kennedy>And there's an automated code and AI section.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:39.060
<v Michael Kennedy>And the gist is you're encouraged to use AI tools to do things, you know, whatever tools you have at hand to do things efficiently.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.380
<v Michael Kennedy>But also know that there is human effort on the other end for the pull request.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:53.520
<v Michael Kennedy>And they just basically want to make sure that you're not doing less effort than they have to do to just check it.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.180
<v Michael Kennedy>So please put a person in the middle.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.420
<v Michael Kennedy>So there's things like they will automatically,

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:04.060
<v Michael Kennedy>they will close things that look like automated pull requests

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.860
<v Michael Kennedy>from bots and whatever.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.700
<v Michael Kennedy>And there is a section on human effort denial of service.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Using automated tools and AI to submit PRs or comments

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.160
<v Michael Kennedy>that we have to carefully review and handle

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.940
<v Michael Kennedy>would be an equivalent of a denial of service attack on our human effort.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.080
<v Michael Kennedy>It would be very little effort for a person submitting the PR

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.680
<v Michael Kennedy>that generates a large amount of effort on our side.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Please don't do that.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.760
<v Michael Kennedy>So I think this is completely fair.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.920
<v Michael Kennedy>And it said, we will block accounts that spam us

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.760
<v Michael Kennedy>with repeated automated PRs or comments.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Use tools wisely.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Michael Kennedy>And a nice, what is this Spider-Man quote?

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:57.020
<v Michael Kennedy>with great power i mean tools comes great responsibility so um i just think this was a

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.160
<v Michael Kennedy>it was good on their part to to throw this in of uh of yes use tools but

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:10.360
<v Michael Kennedy>know that there's a human on the other side having to deal with it so yeah keep it focused right like

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.800
<v Brian Okken>don't submit a 7 000 line pr and say i made it better you know like

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:22.280
<v Brian Okken>It was probably some small little part that need changed and stay on target, right?

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:34.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's actually, now that you bring that up, it is very easy now to say, oh, I want to refactor this function to be a new, like, even without AI, I want to refactor this function to be a new function name.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's going to change tons of code.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:46.360
<v Michael Kennedy>That's still okay to do if it's focused, even if it hits like hundreds of files, if it's just that one thing, like separate those up so that code reviewers can go,

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.800
<v Michael Kennedy>oh yeah, you just changed that function name, that's fine.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Michael Kennedy>But if you do that plus, oh, plus I formatted with black

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Michael Kennedy>and plus I optimize this one function,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.120
<v Michael Kennedy>that's terrible to combine those together.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.700
<v Brian Okken>And less it's true.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.320
<v Brian Okken>- Yeah, and AI, it's very common for it

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.840
<v Brian Okken>to just churn through that kind of stuff

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Brian Okken>and generate a bunch of changes.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.640
<v Brian Okken>The curl team actually has blocked all AI contributions,

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.080
<v Brian Okken>period, for the same reason.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.400
<v Brian Okken>It's like, this is out of control, we're not doing it.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:19.960
<v Michael Kennedy>I got a weird request for a private repository or like to,

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.700
<v Michael Kennedy>when I was starting the pytest course,

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.380
<v Michael Kennedy>I kicked around the idea of having a GitHub group or whatever,

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.420
<v Michael Kennedy>like whatever those are, organization for testing code.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.880
<v Michael Kennedy>I decided not to, but it's that organization still has some of the private code

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I used for the course.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:46.360
<v Michael Kennedy>And I had somebody request me to give it Claude access to my private notes.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Michael Kennedy>No, I'm not going to do that.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.240
<v Brian Okken>I'll share one really quick weird Claude plus GitHub thing while we're on the topic.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Brian Okken>Then we'll move on.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Brian Okken>I am working on this project that I was doing something with Claude code on,

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.220
<v Brian Okken>or this feature, and I created a GitHub issue with a lot of notes for myself about it on GitHub,

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.520
<v Brian Okken>but I didn't connect Claude code to it or anything.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.460
<v Brian Okken>and then I was like, hey, Claude, let's just brainstorm

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.420
<v Brian Okken>about what it would look like in this code base to add this feature.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.820
<v Brian Okken>And it takes a second and it goes, I see that you've considered this, this, and this.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:26.640
<v Brian Okken>And now that I've got that background, I think this, I'm like, how do you know that?

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.900
<v Brian Okken>What it had done is I had the GitHub, the GH CLI installed on my computer.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:37.140
<v Brian Okken>And so it used GH to go explore the GitHub repository and find the issue,

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.200
<v Brian Okken>like issue 1,274 or something.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.180
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, issue 1274 said you wanted to do it this way.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.400
<v Brian Okken>I'm like, okay, that is insane that it just got in there.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.860
<v Brian Okken>I didn't ask it to, you know what I mean?

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:50.860
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, anyway.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Do I want GH on my computer?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.060
<v Brian Okken>I'm like, how did it figure that out?

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.320
<v Brian Okken>It shouldn't have access to that information, but it's okay.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.700
<v Brian Okken>How about we move on?

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.540
<v Brian Okken>Extra time.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:03.540
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:05.560
<v Brian Okken>Do you have any extras?

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:06.440
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, sure.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.260
<v Brian Okken>I got a couple, and then we can flip over to you.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.620
<v Brian Okken>So first of all, remember, Henry Schreiner pointed out

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.780
<v Brian Okken>that you can use compiled bytecode as a flag to uv.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.860
<v Brian Okken>And it points out in the uv docs here

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.220
<v Brian Okken>that uv does not compile PY files to bytecode

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.500
<v Brian Okken>in the dunderpycache startup PYC file.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.240
<v Brian Okken>Instead, that is lazily done at module import.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.859
<v Brian Okken>And that really got my attention

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.000
<v Brian Okken>because all of the Docker deployments that we do.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.280
<v Brian Okken>For example, Python Bytes runs on Docker.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.000
<v Brian Okken>So when I deploy a new version of Python Bytes.fm, what happens?

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.320
<v Brian Okken>It compiles the code, installs the dependencies with uv,

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.320
<v Brian Okken>and then it starts, you know, there's other stuff, but effectively,

00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:01.620
<v Brian Okken>then it just starts Granian running Python Bytes, right, as a core to app.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.900
<v Brian Okken>And from the time that it actually starts starting

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.160
<v Brian Okken>until it's all the way started,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.540
<v Brian Okken>like the website is unavailable, right?

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.980
<v Brian Okken>Because it's not some super complicated Kubernetes thing.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.540
<v Brian Okken>It just restarts the Docker container.

00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:19.600
<v Brian Okken>And for me, for the extra simplicity

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.800
<v Brian Okken>of like having one to two seconds of downtime

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.860
<v Brian Okken>per couple of times a week is totally fine.

00:24:27.719 --> 00:24:30.620
<v Brian Okken>But what I realized when Henry said that,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.060
<v Brian Okken>and you talked about uv not compiling,

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:39.680
<v Brian Okken>these things, that that actually means it's got to every time I start the Docker container,

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:46.800
<v Brian Okken>literally every time it has to compile the PYC files for every library that it uses. And it uses

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.620
<v Brian Okken>like well over 50. There's a lot of libraries for these web apps, right? And I'm like, wow. Okay,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:59.820
<v Brian Okken>so there's no scenario where it will ever not have to generate those on App Start, right? Because I

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.220
<v Brian Okken>don't ever shut down the Docker container and start it again.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.580
<v Brian Okken>The only reason the Docker container will ever shut down

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.480
<v Brian Okken>is because it needs a new version of code or dependencies.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.660
<v Brian Okken>So it rebuilds the container from scratch using layers.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.320
<v Brian Okken>And then it will bring that back up.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:24.800
<v Brian Okken>So I added--compile-bytecode to all of the uv installs.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.700
<v Brian Okken>Because I don't care if the build time is one second slower,

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.140
<v Brian Okken>if that means the actual launch time, which involves downtime,

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.760
<v Brian Okken>is one second faster.

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:40.100
<v Michael Kennedy>OK, so does this precompile thing

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.300
<v Michael Kennedy>happen then at the time you're building the Docker image?

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.040
<v Brian Okken>Yes, which has nothing to do with the uptime or anything.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.080
<v Brian Okken>It's not until you say restart the Docker container

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.680
<v Brian Okken>with the new image that it actually shuts down the old one

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.360
<v Brian Okken>and starts the new one.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.840
<v Brian Okken>So I make the build time one second slower,

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.020
<v Brian Okken>but the launch time one second faster, which is awesome.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and it probably makes, like, what,

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.340
<v Michael Kennedy>the Docker image a little bit bigger?

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:04.260
<v Brian Okken>Probably.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:05.660
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, yeah, yeah, probably.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.940
<v Brian Okken>But it would have, you know,

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Brian Okken>I guess it does make the image a little bit bigger,

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.980
<v Brian Okken>but I'm not shipping it to Docker Hub and back,

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:12.480
<v Brian Okken>so I don't really care.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.340
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, even if you were, it's that, yeah,

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.660
<v Michael Kennedy>one second faster to do the flip over.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:20.720
<v Michael Kennedy>It's great.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.380
<v Brian Okken>I think it's, and all it is,

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:27.060
<v Brian Okken>Just include --compile dash bytecode on your uv and stuff.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:27.920
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, sweet.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.000
<v Brian Okken>So thanks, everyone, you and Henry and whoever else.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.760
<v Brian Okken>Okay, two things real quick.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:39.320
<v Brian Okken>I talked about the MCP server for Talk Python and how that works,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.800
<v Brian Okken>but I did a nice little write-up about it over on the Talk Python blog.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.820
<v Brian Okken>So I just want to point people to that proper write-up,

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:52.360
<v Brian Okken>which has some background on the MCP server and the LLMs.txt information.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.960
<v Brian Okken>there. And another thing, Brian, people sent me a message and said,

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:04.300
<v Brian Okken>so let me get this right. You just recall, recounted the story of Tailwind CSS getting

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:12.660
<v Brian Okken>destroyed by AI. And then you purposefully added AI stuff to talk Python? Are you insane?

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:20.839
<v Brian Okken>Well, okay, maybe, but I don't think so. So I also wrote a blog post on my personal blog about

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:27.880
<v Brian Okken>why I think hiding from AI, blocking AI crawlers

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.660
<v Brian Okken>is probably not going to serve you in the long term

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.420
<v Brian Okken>and why that I added these things.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.740
<v Brian Okken>So it sort of gave my background on why I thought that was worth doing.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.440
<v Brian Okken>So people are like, Michael's kind of got

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.060
<v Brian Okken>two contradicting thoughts in his mind at the same time.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:46.840
<v Brian Okken>Well, here's the background.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.380
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't think it's contradictory, though.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:56.460
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it would be like you having an AI-generated thing

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.520
<v Michael Kennedy>on all of the content of Talk Python training.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:01.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.480
<v Michael Kennedy>And you wouldn't do that because that's what you make money off of.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:07.340
<v Brian Okken>Exactly.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.360
<v Brian Okken>Basically, I'm saying if you have content you would like in Google,

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.420
<v Brian Okken>you probably want it in AI indexes as well.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.240
<v Brian Okken>If it's something you don't want publicly available on Google,

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.120
<v Brian Okken>then you probably don't want it here as well, right?

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.660
<v Brian Okken>But this is like assuming you want to show up in search results

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.160
<v Brian Okken>for regular search engines, you probably do at least.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.000
<v Brian Okken>And also just really quick while we're on it,

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.160
<v Brian Okken>like putting in the MCP sort of stuff here

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.780
<v Brian Okken>means it turns questions like, hey, what guests were on the show?

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.040
<v Brian Okken>Or what was this episode about?

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.760
<v Brian Okken>Or maybe I could find the transcripts for a page or whatever.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:54.660
<v Brian Okken>It turns that from scraping my website and hitting tons of code to database index single queries for a small fragment of text.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:03.000
<v Brian Okken>So if the AI is going to ask questions anyway, this is way less harm on my server, if you will.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, hopefully they do that instead of doing both, though.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I know.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.820
<v Michael Kennedy>The other thing is, so is this a process now?

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you have to keep this updated on a weekly basis?

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.400
<v Brian Okken>No, it's all just driven by the database.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:18.700
<v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.140
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, and if you look at my personal post version,

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:29.920
<v Brian Okken>you can actually see some pictures of how Claude.ai, the chatbot, is using.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.140
<v Brian Okken>So I'll ask it, like, what are the last five episodes?

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.640
<v Brian Okken>You can see it's actually calling the API endpoint, getting recent episodes.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.540
<v Brian Okken>Or if you ask it more, it'll search.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.000
<v Brian Okken>And then based on the search results, it'll get the details and so on.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:44.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:54.060
<v Michael Kennedy>One of my next projects in the near future is to try to build one of these for internal stuff so that internal tools can see internal APIs.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.040
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.080
<v Brian Okken>It's very neat, and it's not that hard.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:03.820
<v Brian Okken>Also, you don't need a whole framework like Fast MCP or one of these things.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.160
<v Brian Okken>It's just a couple of simple web requests.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.860
<v Brian Okken>It's not like implementing your own web sockets or something.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.660
<v Brian Okken>You can just add it to any website.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.240
<v Brian Okken>It's super easy.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:15.380
<v Brian Okken>Cool.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:16.260
<v Brian Okken>All right.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Any other extras?

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Nope.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Over to you.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:23.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's see.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:23.900
<v Michael Kennedy>What do I got?

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:24.880
<v Michael Kennedy>I got a few.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:26.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you remember Dig?

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I do.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Dig is back.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:37.680
<v Michael Kennedy>and i'm linking to a tech crunch article and i um there's a bunch of articles on it but um it just

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:44.800
<v Michael Kennedy>uh it's i did a quick skim basically they're trying to trying to trying to be what dig used

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:52.700
<v Michael Kennedy>to be but not not sucky um and also um uh some interesting people kevin rose from

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:59.739
<v Michael Kennedy>um and uh and one of the co-founders from from reddit are putting it together um interesting

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:06.980
<v Michael Kennedy>and uh yeah anyway i'm i'll be interested to watch to see if it becomes a uh something that

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:13.080
<v Michael Kennedy>we should care about but um anyway interesting article um also uh there's a python community

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:19.620
<v Michael Kennedy>in there just started there's 99 members it's 99 members of python in the world um no there's more

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.999
<v Michael Kennedy>but in the on the dig community and uh um is put together by somebody that meant that actually the

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:33.020
<v Michael Kennedy>same person that sent it to us and said hey so this wigging person uh sent it to us which is

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:37.960
<v Michael Kennedy>great and also talked about us python bites podcast yay so yeah thank you yeah it's awesome

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:45.660
<v Michael Kennedy>another interesting article i uh ran across was uh from i think i'm sorry marik marik

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:51.939
<v Michael Kennedy>why lightweight websites may one day save your life but basically just ode to lightweight

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:58.600
<v Michael Kennedy>websites. And this is a lot to do with if the intent is for people to be able to use your website,

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.740
<v Michael Kennedy>even if they're on a cell phone, even if they have like a bad connection,

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:09.380
<v Michael Kennedy>then lightweight websites are a must. That's just basically it. Think about your target audience.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.559
<v Michael Kennedy>If your target audience is on the move, make it light and fast. Obvious. Last shout out to

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.700
<v Michael Kennedy>to a article called

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:26.520
<v Michael Kennedy>How to Parameterize Exception Testing in pytest.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:33.040
<v Michael Kennedy>And I'm glad people are still writing articles about pytest.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:39.600
<v Michael Kennedy>And I'm going to let it slide that he did the capitalization wrong.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.000
<v Michael Kennedy>No capitals in pytest.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Michael Kennedy>It's fine.

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Brian Okken>You can fix it.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.420
<v Brian Okken>If you just right-click on that and say inspect,

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.420
<v Brian Okken>you can fix his website.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.220
<v Brian Okken>You didn't know if you could edit other people's sites,

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.880
<v Michael Kennedy>You just pay. Really?

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.580
<v Brian Okken>Well, for you, but if you reload or anyone else, it doesn't change.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Michael Kennedy>The trick here, which is cool, is he's parameterizing whether or not something raises an exception.

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:11.040
<v Michael Kennedy>And he's using a thing from context lib called null context and importing it and changing its name to does not raise.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:18.480
<v Michael Kennedy>And this is brilliant because this is very clear code to say, yeah, these cases, that shouldn't raise an exception.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:23.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Other cases should be a zero division error or a type error or whatever.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Obviously, you're not going to write a test for test division exceptions.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.240
<v Michael Kennedy>But to test your own code, just make sure that it's raising the right exceptions.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:32.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.600
<v Michael Kennedy>And throwing in a couple of cases for when it doesn't raise.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.760
<v Michael Kennedy>This is good, clean code and short article.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:39.440
<v Michael Kennedy>So I like it.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.160
<v Brian Okken>It's a very clean code.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.400
<v Brian Okken>I would have not seen that coming.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.460
<v Brian Okken>That's pretty good.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:44.340
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.040
<v Brian Okken>That's very, very good.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, that's it.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:49.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Do we have something funny?

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:57.720
<v Brian Okken>This last thing here, this joke is really here basically for you, Brian.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.440
<v Brian Okken>This was sent in by Pat Decker, I believe.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.380
<v Brian Okken>And I think it's good.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:05.460
<v Brian Okken>I think you'll appreciate this coming from a testing perspective, okay?

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:06.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.679
<v Brian Okken>So this was on Reddit.

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:14.300
<v Brian Okken>And the idea here is two developers talking,

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.399
<v Brian Okken>or maybe project manager, I don't know,

00:34:17.399 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Brian Okken>says, your new date picker widget has crashed.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:20.520
<v Brian Okken>Really?

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:21.220
<v Brian Okken>That's impossible.

00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:24.520
<v Brian Okken>I've tested it with negative numbers, special characters,

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.120
<v Brian Okken>null.

00:34:25.419 --> 00:34:26.340
<v Brian Okken>What have you put in it?

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.899
<v Brian Okken>A date?

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:30.460
<v Brian Okken>A date?

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:30.919
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:31.659
<v Brian Okken>Whoops.

00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:34.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Forgot the base case.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.979
<v Brian Okken>So busy testing all the edge cases and the area conditions

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.899
<v Michael Kennedy>it forgot to see if it even worked yeah um yeah that's a weird thing i think that there's so many

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:52.040
<v Michael Kennedy>people like think that testing is just about like the complicated edge cases but you got to get the

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:57.960
<v Michael Kennedy>the happy path first and make sure those work also yeah yeah absolutely that's funny

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:04.339
<v Michael Kennedy>pretty good one pretty good did you you've heard that tester walks into the bar right

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.200
<v Michael Kennedy>I think so, but give me your variant

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Bad memory, but

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:16.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Tester walks into a bar

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.180
<v Michael Kennedy>and orders a half a beer

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.000
<v Michael Kennedy>and one and a half beers and a negative beer

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Michael Kennedy>and a million beers to see what happens

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Michael Kennedy>and everything works fine

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:32.659
<v Brian Okken>I thought the bar caught on fire

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.260
<v Michael Kennedy>actual customer comes into the bar

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.540
<v Michael Kennedy>and orders one beer and bar catches

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.460
<v Michael Kennedy>on fire. There you go.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.760
<v Brian Okken>It's beautiful.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Brian Okken>It's a beautiful thing.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.040
<v Brian Okken>It's a

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.660
<v Brian Okken>it's like a fable that tells

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.580
<v Brian Okken>the moral story of

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:51.860
<v Brian Okken>testing.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.180
<v Michael Kennedy>And then my dad joke version, of course,

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.040
<v Michael Kennedy>the guy walks into a bar and says,

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Michael Kennedy>ow.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.300
<v Brian Okken>All right.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Brian Okken>it does hurt different kind of bar

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Michael Kennedy>sorry

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.620
<v Michael Kennedy>spoiled your joke but

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.720
<v Michael Kennedy>alright another fun episode

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.940
<v Michael Kennedy>talk to you guys next week

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:14.800
<v Michael Kennedy>bye y'all
