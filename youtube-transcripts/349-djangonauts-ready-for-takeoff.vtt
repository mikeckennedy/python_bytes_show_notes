00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
Hey, welcome everybody on the stream and good to talk to you again, Michael.


00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.120
Yeah, good to see you.


00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.120
Ready to jump in?


00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.120
Let's go.


00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.120
I guess I'll take that as a yes.


00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.600
Anyway, hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines


00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.160
directly to your earbuds.


00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.200
This is episode 349, recorded August 21st, 2023.


00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.900
And I am Brian Okken.


00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.300
And I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.500
And we have a lot of exciting stuff to cover this week.


00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.260
But before we do, I'd like to thank our Patreon supporters


00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.480
and ourselves for keeping this thing going,


00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.460
even without sponsors.


00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.380
But if you or your company would like to sponsor Python Bytes,


00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.340
just talk to us.


00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.460
So anyway, Michael, do you want to kick us off


00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.700
with the first story?


00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.420
Let's kick it off.


00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.800
Let's kick it off with some open source


00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.160
that's not exactly Python.


00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.320
But when I talked about this on Mastodon,


00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.040
you know what, Mastodon hasn't even changed its name


00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.440
this week, so that's pretty cool.


00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.120
(laughing)


00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.120
I talked about it in Mastodon,


00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.040
there seemed to be quite a bit of excitement


00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.880
and interest in this.


00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.040
So I figured, you know what,


00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.560
let's make this a topic for Python Bytes.


00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.960
'Cause there's two cool open source things.


00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.680
So surely you've heard of Instapaper.


00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.320
That's the OG, I want to read something later


00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.520
without ads, without distractions.


00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.440
You know, a lot of times it's not even ads.


00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.400
It's just like, wow, the fonts are so small on this website


00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.960
or the layout is so bad, you know?


00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080
- Yeah, I kind of forgot about Instapaper, but yeah.


00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.920
- Yeah, Instapaper was the OG, right?


00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.760
- Yeah.


00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.740
- And then Pocket is probably the most well-known version


00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.680
of that and, you know, Pocket's kind of cool.


00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.080
It was either, I believe it was acquired by,


00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.320
not created by Mozilla, but, you know,


00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.080
supporting Pocket kind of supports Mozilla,


00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.120
which kind of supports Firefox, which is good,


00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.840
but Google mostly supports Firefox, so there's that.


00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.260
So Pocket's pretty good,


00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.240
but there's this new project on YOLO,


00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.080
let's say new to Michael, called Omnivore,


00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.700
and is the free open-source


00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.680
read-it-later app for serious readers.


00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.760
- Okay. - Okay?


00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.140
So this thing is super, super nice.


00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.720
The integrations with, at least I've only tested it on iOS,


00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.440
but the integration with iOS are incredible.


00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.480
So it's really easy to go from something like Reader,


00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.280
right, Reader, which I've talked about before


00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.800
in the RSS world, but you know,


00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.520
you pick your RSS reader of choice,


00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.120
go through your articles, you hit share,


00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.120
and boom, it just goes straight into Omnivore,


00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.280
which is pretty cool.


00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.520
And then it has a really nice way to categorize, tag,


00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.080
all that kind of stuff, and then read it.


00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.480
So Brett Cannon, when I posted this, asked,


00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.920
well, how do you find it compared to Pocket and other stuff?


00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.240
Does it strip out too many things?


00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.200
Henik jumped in and said, oh, this is way better.


00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.160
It seems to err a little bit on the side


00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.680
and leaving potentially a little bit too much stuff in,


00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.200
but at the same time not removing quotes


00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.960
or code sections or things like that.


00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.000
So really, really nice.


00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It's distraction-free, privacy-focused, open source.


00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.740
You can even self-host it if you'd like.


00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.620
So for some reason you want,


00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.660
you're like, I'm gonna read stuff


00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.340
and I wanna make sure that it's completely private,


00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.620
then you can set it up and run it on your own.


00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.100
- Oh, that's pretty cool.


00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.280
- That's pretty cool, right?


00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.740
And one other thing that's quite neat about it,


00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.140
let me kind of pull through here a bit.


00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.740
So one of the things you can do,


00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.860
I don't know if it even shows it,


00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.220
but it obviously syncs where you've read.


00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.560
So you can go down and like if you've read 23%


00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.060
into an article, like a long, you know,


00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.860
30 minute read time article,


00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.020
and you switch to another device or to the web,


00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.860
it'll say, you know, here's how far you are,


00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.180
resume from there.


00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.420
The other thing it does is it has text to speech,


00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.340
which, you know, that's,


00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.660
it sounds like a robot's reading to you sometime,


00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.420
But they have a, like a high end text to speech option where there's not


00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.260
very many voices to choose from, but it sounds almost like a person


00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.300
reading the articles to you.


00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.540
Oh, wow.


00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.340
And so that is, that's super nice.


00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.380
And it'll show you, you can have it like highlight the words


00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.860
as you, as it's reading along.


00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.580
So if you, you got an article to read, but really also got the yard to mow,


00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.020
you know, seriously, put it in the background and just go, it's actually,


00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.500
actually super, super neat.


00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.980
And what else?


00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.380
I think that's probably it.


00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.460
You can take highlights and stuff as you would expect,


00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.140
but it's really good for when you've got to do a lot of research on a project.


00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.700
I think it's really good for us, honestly.


00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.020
We read a lot of articles, and you want to take notes,


00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.420
highlight a section, add a note about why that's relevant and stuff.


00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.620
So when we go back to one of these long articles,


00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.260
and we're like, hey, I want to tell Brian about it, or vice versa.


00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.300
You're like, what was the part of this that actually started?


00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.820
Here it is.


00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.860
You just bump through it.


00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.660
So really, really neat.


00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.580
And then it said, you also sync it with other stuff,


00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.820
like your second brain things.


00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.080
I'm like, wait, what is it talking about?


00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.060
It says you can connect it to things like LogSec.


00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.580
LogSec is another open source thing


00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.620
that's kind of like Notion, but running locally.


00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.620
Think runs locally.


00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.420
Anyway, so here's something else that I discovered


00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.080
along the way that's also pretty excellent.


00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.160
So you can do whiteboards with YouTube videos


00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.840
that connect over to different parts.


00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.920
It's kind of funky, but I haven't used that much.


00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.440
But Omnivore, strong recommendation for this.


00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.240
People should definitely, definitely check it out.


00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.480
That's pretty cool.


00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.120
I was thinking about that text-to-speech thing.


00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.000
I would have loved that when I was in college


00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.040
and I had to read a bunch of junk.


00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.780
Oh, gosh, I know.


00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.240
And I'm on the bus or something.


00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.720
That would have been great.


00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.840
Yeah, or you're in a car, but you--


00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.680
At least for me, I can't really read in the car.


00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.360
I can read a little bit, but then I'm like,


00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.080
you know, just one wrong turn or one bump,


00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.720
and I'm like, you know what?


00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.560
Kind of woozy.


00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.160
I don't want to read in the car anymore.


00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.520
But this, you could totally do.


00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.720
I'm a big fan.


00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.320
I've started reading a lot more in the last week


00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.960
since I've been playing with this.


00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.520
- Nice, okay, cool.


00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.040
- And Pat on the audience points out that Edge,


00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.520
the browser, has good voices when you use read aloud.


00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.080
So, pretty cool.


00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.600
- Edge, what's that?


00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.120
- I think it's some kind of browser.


00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.620
- Okay. (laughs)


00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.460
- Just kidding.


00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.280
You know it's Chromium.


00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.640
If you say the word browser and it's not Firefox,


00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.040
it's really just Chromium.


00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.240
- Yeah, isn't Vivaldi based on Chromium?


00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.600
- If Vivaldi is, Brave is, they all are, yeah.


00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.920
- But, well, Firefox isn't, is it?


00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.160
- No, Firefox is the standout.


00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.340
It's the holdout.


00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.480
Which is like the main reason I love them, so.


00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.300
- What I kind of, is Google like supporting them


00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.940
so that they don't look like a monopoly?


00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.780
Just to make sure--


00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.620
- That's a pretty strong theory, isn't it?


00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.980
- Okay, yeah.


00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.180
- I mean, I'm not saying that, but he said that.


00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.340
(laughing)


00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.480
I think 80 to 90% of Mozilla's revenue comes from Google,


00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.140
which I think also leads to a little bit


00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.820
of perverse incentives, right?


00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.000
Like Firefox would be better if it could be more assertive


00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.140
in ad blocking and more assertive in privacy.


00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.500
I know it kinda has it, but not really.


00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.820
Like it could go way more in like Vivaldi or Brave does,


00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.700
except it's almost entirely single customer


00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.020
is an ad company.


00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.020
So how much, yeah, it's a little weird setup,


00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.100
but it does keep Firefox alive, so there's that.


00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.780
Over to you, what's next?


00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.060
- Well, I'd like to talk about Django a little bit,


00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.300
and actually people learning about Django.


00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.300
So I learned about this place called DjangoNaut.space.


00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.340
It's where contributors launch.


00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.340
So kind of a fun, kind of a fun drop or a homepage.


00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.680
But I mean, if you click on anything,


00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.060
you go to just like a docs thing, but so the,


00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.080
but that's all right.


00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.420
The Django-NOT program is kind of neat.


00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.120
It's a program to help people learn Django,


00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.720
like really dig into it.


00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.660
So it says, "This program places an emphasis


00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.080
"on group learning, sustainability, and longevity.


00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.800
"Django-nauts are members of the community


00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.460
"who wish to level up their current Django code contributions


00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.840
"and potentially take on leadership roles


00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.560
"in Django in the future."


00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.680
So this is pretty cool.


00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.460
It's a self-paced, semi-structured learning environment


00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.640
with group mentoring, and it's in three-month chunks.


00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.740
So, and they have like different cohorts


00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.040
and then there's like different documentation


00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.120
on if you wanna be a Django knot,


00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.280
if you wanna be a navigator,


00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.160
which is people leading other Djangonauts


00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.920
and then a captain and stuff like that.


00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.400
And this is actually just kind of a neat,


00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.400
I'd love to talk to somebody that has been involved in this


00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.640
or maybe it's new, I'm not sure.


00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.240
It doesn't look like it's been around for much


00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.480
for very long, so I'm not sure


00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.720
if they already have cohorts gone through or not,


00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.640
but I'd love to hear more about how it's going.


00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.960
'Cause it's kind of a model for an open source project


00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.200
seems neat of the people that kind of want to get


00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.320
more involved, but really don't know what to do


00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.120
or how to get further, maybe like having a guided thing.


00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.160
That's awesome.


00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.320
So the other thing, one of the things I think


00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.040
that's really cool about this is the small group setting.


00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.000
So this is a said cohorts are no more than four janganots


00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.500
per one navigator and no more than eight Djangonauts


00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.340
in a group.


00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.640
So you might have like two navigators per group,


00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.700
which is kind of neat.


00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.760
Three months.


00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.800
And then one of the things that they have access


00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.580
to a private discord server,


00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.040
and then programs receive support from captains.


00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.700
So I'm not, I haven't dug in too much.


00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.340
I'm not sure what a captain does.


00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.780
They help, oh, the captains help organize the program


00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.160
and reduce the admin burden of navigators.


00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.260
Neat.


00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.700
One of the goals here is of course to do peer mentoring


00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.260
and to get people leveled up a lot.


00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.740
But one of the things that I think is really cool here


00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.480
is even if you think you sign on,


00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.340
I can't find where it's in the docs right here,


00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.580
but somewhere it said, basically you sign up,


00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.500
you think you're gonna do it,


00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.500
but life happens and you need to not work on it so much.


00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.000
Do that.


00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.060
I mean, that's more important.


00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.140
So I love the humanity in there of saying,


00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.340
personal health is always above things like this.


00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.260
So it's neat.


00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.940
- Django does community like no other web framework, right?


00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.140
- Yeah. - Seriously.


00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.140
This is a fantastic idea.


00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.740
- Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.


00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.100
The welcome summary,


00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.960
welcome in summary for the Django is pretty cool.


00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.900
Oh, here it is.


00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.320
The program will have a focus on sustainability and longevity.


00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.380
Remember that while we want you to be successful, your health and happiness comes above all


00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.380
else.


00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.380
I just love it.


00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.160
It seems like a cool program.


00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.700
This is great.


00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.700
So comment from the chat.


00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.140
Kids today have it so easy.


00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.980
This makes open source contributions look like a cruise.


00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.900
I think that we just need to, we need to make it easier for the next generation to come


00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.380
in and help take over.


00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.380
So I think it's great.


00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.380
Yup.


00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:01.900
I used to have to do my pull requests uphill both ways.


00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.860
I used to have to mail zip files to people.


00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.860
Exactly.


00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.860
Anyway.


00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:12.700
Get all sneaker net.


00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.700
So all right.


00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.860
This is a great, this is a great thing for people to sign up to.


00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.620
And I guess, presumably, you just go there,


00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.660
it tells you how to sign up and register


00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.740
to possibly be part of it.


00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.980
- Yeah, so let's see.


00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.780
If I click sign up, oh yeah, it takes me to a sign up form.


00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.840
You fill out your--


00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.980
- Oh, you can even sign up as a navigator or a captain


00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.820
if you wanna help out.


00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.700
That's great. - Yeah.


00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.740
Or an other.


00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.260
I'm gonna try to sign up as a cheerleader.


00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.700
- Hey, you can't label me, man.


00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.540
You can't label me.


00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.700
I'm just gonna be here.


00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.300
- Other, but you have to label yourself.


00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.300
If you-- - That's okay.


00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.300
pick other, you have to pick something.


00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.540
(laughing)


00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.380
- Yeah.


00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.200
- Yeah.


00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.040
- Anyway.


00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.100
(sighing)


00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.340
All right, well Michael.


00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.160
- This is on to another one here.


00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:05.540
This one, it's from me, actually,


00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.580
something I created this week I wanna give a shout out to


00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.380
'cause I think it's just gonna help people a ton.


00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.220
- Okay.


00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.100
- And it's gonna lead over to maybe some more Django stuff


00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.020
And then later we'll come back to a Google form.


00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.020
Let's start with this.


00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.700
So I'll set the stage.


00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:30.500
So if you're working on a website, especially the web design aspect of a website, what you


00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.700
often do is you'll go over to your CSS file, you'll make some changes, you'll have to reload


00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.700
your page.


00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:43.660
You go over to the browser, control or command R or F5, whatever your system does.


00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.860
You reload it, you'll look at it.


00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.900
Okay, great.


00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.620
Maybe sometimes you need it on mobile.


00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.220
So you'll have like a, one of those device,


00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.900
you know, sort of device sized changers for your browser,


00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.260
or you could open up a real, you know,


00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.460
real iPhone or an iPhone simulator pointed at it.


00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.940
Maybe you have both of those side by sides.


00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.180
You've got to refresh one, refresh the other,


00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.380
go back to your CSS.


00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.500
Now you go over your HTML, you add some classes.


00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.220
Go back, see how it looks, refresh it, right?


00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.660
What would be cool is if you could just have on a second monitor or on a large


00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.260
monitor off to the side, your browser.


00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.160
And as you type, when you hit save, regardless of whether you're editing


00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.660
CSS, JavaScript, HTML, whatever, the page just refreshes and shows you the new view.


00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.940
That'd be awesome.


00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.140
Right?


00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.620
Yeah.


00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:38.100
So I created a JavaScript script that you include only in development


00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.820
time, so don't forget that you put it on top of your page.


00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.900
It does exactly that.


00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.660
So you can have an iOS simulator running,


00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.940
you can have like Brave, let's say, running over there,


00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.300
then you're over to the side, you're working on your editor,


00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.260
and as you hit save, any file you want, right?


00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.860
HTML, templates, whether it's CSS, JavaScript,


00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.440
just reloads, even images.


00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.220
- Cool. - Without touching it.


00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.500
Isn't that cool?


00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.880
- Okay, so I've got my editor set up


00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.320
to just save all the time.


00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.300
So it's gonna save junk.


00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.300
Does it just like, what happens if I've got junk saved?


00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.380
- Well, so if you're typing in the HTML,


00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.020
it'll probably go a little bit wonky, right?


00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.820
If it's Python though, it depends on what you wanna do.


00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.660
So for me, what I found is that I'm not needing it


00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.820
to reload almost constantly when I'm doing logic


00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.820
of the website, like sometimes I want it to,


00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.980
but not all the time.


00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.980
Whereas when I'm actually messing with the CSS and I'm actually messing with--


00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.980
Oh yeah, then you wanted to do it all the time.


00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.980
Then you want to do it all the time, right?


00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:55.980
So the way it works if you don't take any action is it will reload if the contents of the page change.


00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:02.980
So if you don't restart your Python web setup, even as you type, it's not going to--


00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.980
Yeah, okay.


00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.020
>> Presumably, you wouldn't have it set up because


00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.660
like every keystroke would restart it and that would be pretty annoying.


00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.300
>> Well, that's what I was worried about.


00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:20.300
>> Yeah. So there's a few other projects like Alex.


00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.940
First of all, I just want to give Alex Revere


00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.460
a shout out for helping me modernize the script.


00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.780
He says, "Hey, that's cool. You want a more modern version of it?"


00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.900
I'm like, "Yes, please.


00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.820
My JavaScript is not that good."


00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.540
Then Adam Chains pointed out that he created


00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:40.700
Django browser reload, which does something somewhat like this for Django, where it looks


00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:46.300
and it says, you know, if my Django code has changed and the server has been restarted


00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:52.700
and reloaded, if it's, he says it does static files, although I haven't, I don't know that


00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:58.860
it's necessarily showing, passing through enough information to really reliably do that,


00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.140
like from caching it might still load a stale version of something.


00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.780
But anyway, if you're doing this as like a web hook thing,


00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.460
so you install something inside of your website on the server,


00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.580
and then this script and those like coordinate,


00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:17.140
and I specifically decided I don't want that.


00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.020
This would work on node,


00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.260
this would work on pyramid.


00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.100
The example I'm playing with now is FastAPI,


00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.500
Tailwind, all those things.


00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.180
So it doesn't matter what's on the server.


00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.100
And so that's a trade-off, because it's


00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.540
a little bit more chatty checking back with a server.


00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.940
I find that just--


00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.700
I include a script.


00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.200
This happens.


00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.100
I don't include the script.


00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.140
There's no difference.


00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.940
That's nice to me.


00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.580
So yeah, like I said, you just include a script


00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.460
and make sure that you don't do it in production.


00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.100
It checks by default every second,


00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.640
but you can change that to whatever.


00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.400
open up your dev console and toggle it on and off.


00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.800
So I need you to not mess with it,


00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.960
because I'm going to set a breakpoint.


00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.360
And if you keep requesting this page over and over,


00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.240
you're going to make me crazy and screw up the debugging session.


00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.200
So it works even indirectly.


00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.680
So I'm doing Tailwind.


00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.480
So I added a source CSS file.


00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.800
Tailwind watches that, builds a new CSS file.


00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.440
That CSS file is included in the HTML.


00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.520
The HTML is smart enough to put a little version hash identifier


00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.040
on the CSS, any time it changes,


00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.080
that triggers a change to the HTML, which reloads.


00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.620
So like, same thing for images,


00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.380
same things for JavaScript.


00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.560
So any time there's like a static resource change,


00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.020
as long as you do something like this, it'll pick it up.


00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.280
So if you're doing web development,


00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.060
especially while you're doing the design side,


00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.580
you know, consider grabbing this little script.


00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.520
I don't know how big it is, it's small.


00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.960
It is, let's go, pull it up.


00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.440
I don't know how many lines it is,


00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.100
probably it's like two and a half pages.


00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.400
One of those pages is comments.


00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.540
So that's no big deal.


00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.180
So you can just start in there and try it if you like.


00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.600
It's really nice. Even works over the network if


00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.620
you can get to the server with Ngrok or something like that.


00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.300
>> Yeah, cool.


00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.700
>> Yeah. So it works outside of Python as well,


00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.600
but I built for Python.


00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.740
It's working on FastAPI when I built it.


00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.460
>> Nice.


00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.300
>> All right. Over to you. What's next?


00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.300
Well, we just this is a hot off the presses, at least for us.


00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:34.300
My Matthew Fikert had let us know this morning just this morning.


00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:40.300
Hey, seems like the day has finally come for Excel users to rejoice and use Python in Excel.


00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.300
So what is he talking about?


00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:48.300
There's an announcement from Anaconda that Python and Excel next level data analysis for all.


00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.300
So what does this look like?


00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.460
It says you can write Python code directly in a Microsoft Excel grid.


00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.460
No Python install required.


00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.960
So I don't know much about this, haven't played with it, but it looks fun.


00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.960
It like, all you need is equal pi, equal like py.


00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.660
Oh, there's a little video.


00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:07.960
Cool.


00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.660
So you just say pi and then you can just type in some code.


00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:20.160
I don't know how much coding I want to do right in a Python or in an Excel cell.


00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.880
I guess, but, but I don't know.


00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.720
It sounds kind of neat.


00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:29.520
even it says you can use matplotlib and Seaborn and stuff like this.


00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.080
So I'm not sure how this works.


00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.120
Is it just built into Excel now?


00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.680
I don't know.


00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.600
anyway, I'm excited about it.


00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.400
So I guess I should have researched it a little bit more before


00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.160
talking about it, but neat.


00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.040
Yeah.


00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.000
People can check it out.


00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.600
I, I don't know.


00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.980
I have heard rumors of Python coming to Excel,


00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.040
and this looks like it's coming from Anaconda.


00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:55.500
>> Yeah.


00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:01.360
>> I'm not sure if this is the same thing or if this is something different.


00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.440
>> It says, "Experience the power of Python in Excel for yourself.


00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.560
Windows users can sign up here."


00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.400
>> Click on that. Where does that take you?


00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.440
>> Microsoft.


00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.400
>> Yeah, there you go.


00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.120
I'm interested.


00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.860
So it's part of the 365 Insider program


00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.380
right now to use this feature.


00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.780
So kind of neat.


00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.620
Oh, neat.


00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.660
A little insert.


00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.780
Wow, start using Python.


00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.060
Insert Python formula.


00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.940
Insert a formula.


00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.900
Yeah, I got to do some more research on this


00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.620
before I can say for sure.


00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.020
But you know--


00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.820
I think--


00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.140
If we can save the world from doing VBA, let's do it.


00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:45.860
Yeah.


00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.300
But I think as far as getting this right,


00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.300
I think it's pretty cool to have Anaconda and Microsoft working


00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.500
together to make this work.


00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.580
Those are the right partners to look into this.


00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.540
So yeah.


00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.180
Anyway, I wonder if I--


00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.900
I don't think I'm part of this beta channel thing.


00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.100
So I don't think I can try it.


00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.500
But I'd like to.


00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.500
Anyway, so yeah, I'm not part of the beta program either.


00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.180
I'm not that excited about Office,


00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.500
but I'm excited that this is in here.


00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.580
This is really cool.


00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.420
- Yeah, I am having to use, do more and more spreadsheets


00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.500
as my management, the sort of things increase,


00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.460
so does Excel.


00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.720
It's just part of it.


00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.460
Anyway.


00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.100
- Yeah, there's also some other


00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:46.820
There's a lot of companies and projects out there that have in a Google Doc like hosted


00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.060
spreadsheets that are purely Python based.


00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.860
I talked to, I can't remember the name, I don't want to talk to so many companies at


00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.860
the startup road.


00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:59.420
I don't want to misrepresent them, say, you know, cross one over with the other.


00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.260
But that looked really, really cool as well.


00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.180
And it was only Python.


00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.140
So I don't know, there's a lot of stuff happening


00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.180
around this right now and it's pretty exciting.


00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.160
- Yeah, I guess just a step in the right direction.


00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.000
So that's good.


00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.460
- It was like five years ago,


00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.740
this was the single biggest user voice,


00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.660
single most upvoted user voice thing


00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.500
in the Microsoft request for features and ideas.


00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.980
And it just got no reply.


00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.420
Like they just ignored it.


00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.380
It was crickets below it, right?


00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:39.140
And so it's interesting that it finally got some traction.


00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.980
- Yeah.


00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.500
Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.


00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.300
So maybe we'll see.


00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:50.540
If anybody out there has played with it or knows anything,


00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.820
let me know, it'd be great.


00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.700
- Yeah, or throw a comment at the bottom of YouTube


00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.900
live stream for folks.


00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.740
Yeah.


00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.280
All right.


00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.940
Well, those are our items.


00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.620
do you have any extras for us?


00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.220
I have two things that are extra.


00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.380
Let's talk about them.


00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:16.020
PyCon Sweden, the call for proposals is out and it will be in 78 days, 12 hours,


00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.460
29 minutes, 16 seconds on November 9th and 10th.


00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:25.900
I don't know if I can attend online or in person.


00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.500
It looks like it will be at the Hilton Seducen.


00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.900
So I'm guessing that that's not online.


00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.500
So people can check that out there.


00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.100
That sounds like it'd be pretty awesome.


00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.420
If I was, I would go to it.


00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.460
Yeah, I would too.


00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.560
Yeah.


00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.700
But it's quite the flight from here.


00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.700
So I've never been to Sweden.


00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.660
anything else?


00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.460
I have been to Norway, been to Amsterdam, but not there.


00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.340
And one more thing.


00:24:52.940 --> 00:25:04.620
So I'm looking to do a Talk Python episode around mobile apps and Python.


00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:10.980
And this got started as a listener's like, hey, I'd really love to hear about how you


00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:18.660
built-- how is Python serving as the back end for your Flutter redesign for your mobile


00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.660
apps, right?


00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.740
all Python APIs, but it's something else on the front end.


00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.900
They're like, how did you decide to not use something Python


00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.700
for the front end?


00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.780
Or how did you decide on what you used?


00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.580
And a couple other people had some thoughts as well.


00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.340
So I think it might be really fun to do an episode where


00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:40.060
people who have created or work with--


00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.700
either they're the back end dev or the front end dev


00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.660
or across the board--


00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.920
created mobile apps that are actual apps in the app store,


00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.480
not just like, oh, I tried this framework,


00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.700
but if you have an app in the app store,


00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:59.580
and it has Python involved deeply in some way, right?


00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.280
Maybe the APIs are in Python,


00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.660
or there's some other way in which Python is involved.


00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.200
Maybe you're somehow embedding Python into the app,


00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.900
or even, you know, maybe it's a Kivy app


00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.060
or something like that.


00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.020
If you're interested in being on Talk Python


00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.620
in a panel to kind of talk about what are people doing


00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.220
with Python and mobile these days?


00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.380
I think that would be a lot of fun.


00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.460
I'd love to have you on that show.


00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.900
So the link for this is in the podcast player show notes.


00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.740
I will not read it out, but it says


00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.780
be on Talk Python around mobile apps.


00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.700
The link is tremendously long.


00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.980
So go click that in the show notes or the episode page


00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.580
and just give us your name, what's your app about,


00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.820
like how it's built and like maybe a couple


00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.660
of the really short things.


00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.160
So I'd love to put it together an episode like that,


00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.540
but it's really hard to like know who to invite


00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.180
because it's not entirely obvious


00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.080
looking in from the outside, you know?


00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.020
- Yeah.


00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.640
- Yeah, so call, it's kind of a call for proposals


00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.380
to talk Python, I suppose.


00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.540
And the second appearance of a Google form.


00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.100
Flet, Blaise says Flet.


00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.580
Yeah, Flet is pretty excellent.


00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.220
Flet is, I had the Flet folks on Talk Python


00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:19.220
And Flutter is basically a Python wrapper around Flutter.


00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:25.060
I don't know that they have app store support yet.


00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.900
Maybe they do.


00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.860
- Is Flutter the past tense of Flutter?


00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.300
I am fluttering, I did Flutter.


00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.840
- Yes, exactly.


00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.960
I have something about PyCon 2024 on there.


00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.060
But anyway, Flut is really interesting.


00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.740
I did talk to-- I can't remember the guy's name-- over


00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.540
on Talk Python.


00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:53.340
But I remember it was not quite ready for the app stores,


00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.380
but that was a while ago.


00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.140
So if it's made it further on, sure,


00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.100
Flut would be an awesome part of that discussion.


00:27:59.100 --> 00:27:59.860
Neat.


00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.860
I think I might check it out.


00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.020
I can't wait.


00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.140
Can't wait.


00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.180
Yeah, thanks.


00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:12.700
OK, so I've been so busy lately because I'm


00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.860
I'm working on this pytest course and I find,


00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.940
we announced it last week,


00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.900
but I finally like yesterday morning or something,


00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.820
I finally put it up on my blog.


00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:22.660
Pytest.


00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.260
So python test.com courses,


00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.260
you can finally find it.


00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.780
You can also find the one that I have up on Talk Python Training.


00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.060
There's a link to that and it's still a great course.


00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:31.500
Some,


00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.340
some people ask me,


00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.060
was that like different?


00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:34.860
It is different,


00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:35.700
but it's,


00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.520
it's a,


00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.100
the Talk Python Training one is like a,


00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.400
um,


00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.060
is a,


00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.520
is a good like starter one to like just get,


00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.200
get you going on pytest and it's still awesome.


00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.540
And it's not outdated or anything.


00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.800
The new one is just, it's like the full book,


00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.080
but I'm really trying to keep every,


00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.320
it's not just the full book.


00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.020
It's a whole bunch of extra stuff too,


00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.960
but it's not, I just wanted to mention,


00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.580
it's up on pythontest.com/courses now.


00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.580
So you don't have to find the link because it links to,


00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.420
it's a teachable site. So it links to that one. But the,


00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.100
because I hadn't really announced it really everywhere. I've extended the,


00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.900
last week we said there was a 20% discount.


00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.980
I've extended that 20% discount till the end of the month.


00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.900
So it'll be in the show notes. It's just Python bites, all one word,


00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.780
and it's 20% discount. So,


00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.380
and a whole bunch of people have signed up so far,


00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.880
or enough to make me believe it's a good idea to do this.


00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.000
and I really appreciate the support and the encouragement.


00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.360
I'm really having fun with the fixtures chapter


00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.640
because fixtures are a thing that is hard to get your head


00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.640
around, and I'm really putting a lot of extra effort,


00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.000
putting some drawings in and stuff.


00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.160
So it's going good.


00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.440
I guess that's my extra so far, is just this is going well.


00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.260
- Yeah, great.


00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.100
Glad to hear it.


00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.920
It's exciting to see people interacting


00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.760
with the stuff you build.


00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.480
As I remember when I did a Kickstarter


00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.720
for the first course that I did,


00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.720
I had an early access aspect to it and it was fun.


00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.840
- Yeah, and I think I'm gonna try to do,


00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.120
I'm not gonna promise this,


00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.280
but I'm gonna try to do some open hours


00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.940
or office hours things associated with this also.


00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.720
I just don't have any time this week,


00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.020
so I'm not sure when I'll try to fit that in,


00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.400
but yeah, it'll be good.


00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.560
All right. - Cool.


00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.360
- How about something funny?


00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.720
- How about two somethings funny?


00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.120
- Yeah, do you wanna start with mine or yours?


00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.800
- Okay, somebody, I can't remember where I saw this,


00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.380
but I just think it's hilarious.


00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.640
I was looking for password, secure password generators,


00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.100
and I've got one on my phone,


00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:49.440
but I wanted one like a web accessible one


00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.840
that I could just look up.


00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:55.240
Kenny Loggins, it's Kennylog-in.com.


00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.000
And it's a password generator based on Kenny Loggins songs.


00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.080
(laughing)


00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.320
- Something about the highway to the danger zone


00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.680
and all those things, go on.


00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.520
- So you can pick--


00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.360
The danger zone is weak. Oh no.


00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.920
The danger zone is weak. Yeah, because it's a danger zone.


00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.080
So you can just click how secure you want it,


00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.640
and then you hit generate.


00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.400
And then it generates a, so head up like a king?


00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.880
I don't know, with some symbols in there.


00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.280
It's a pretty secure password for a weak one.


00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.120
Okay.


00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.400
Watching the river run.


00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.360
Nowhere to hide. No way to hide.


00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.840
And then, okay, so all right.


00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.040
I'm all right is all right, like security.


00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.500
And I guess they're just a little bit longer.


00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.200
Anyway, and then strong passwords, this is it.


00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.040
- There we go.


00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.240
- Yeah, those are,


00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.040
but there's like mixed capitalizations and stuff.


00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.560
These would be hard to remember.


00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.560
- That's actually a really good password.


00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.080
That's a totally valid one.


00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.640
- These are all pretty good.


00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.280
It's just, I thought it was really funny


00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.800
to have a themed password generator.


00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.640
It's awesome.


00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.120
(laughing)


00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.680
- It's me and F14 with Maverick in the sky back there


00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.080
leaving a contrail of the password.


00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.740
- And I don't know if it's a generational thing,


00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.540
but I can't even hear the phrase danger zone


00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.960
without it playing in my head.


00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.800
- I know.


00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.640
(laughing)


00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.620
I know, it's pretty good stuff.


00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.460
All right.


00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.280
- Okay, what do you got?


00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.700
- Speaking of the theme here, the password game.


00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.220
Do you wanna play it?


00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.060
- Sure.


00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.640
- @neil.fun/password-game.


00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.780
It says choose a password.


00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.580
Okay, I like the letter A.


00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.140
I'll typically go with that.


00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.660
So it's gotta be five characters.


00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.660
So there we go.


00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.060
Then it says, all right, cool.


00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.060
You pass a couple of things.


00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.760
That's include a number 'cause I type five,


00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.800
A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,


00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.420
A, five, five, five, five.


00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.140
It says it must include an uppercase A,


00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.540
it must include a special character.


00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.140
Bang, what else would you put?


00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.200
Your digits must add 25,


00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.660
so I gotta put another five in there.


00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.500
It could go at the end though.


00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.380
It doesn't have to be in order.


00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.440
It must include, yeah, so May.


00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.960
It must include a sponsor in here.


00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.840
So Pepsi, one of their sponsors, right?


00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.960
So it shows their sponsors.


00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.960
You got to use it.


00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.280
Whatever Roman numerals should multiply to five.


00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.800
This is all additive under the rules.


00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.160
Roman numerals in your--


00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.560
let's see, what is five in a Roman numeral?


00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.240
Do you know?


00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.000
V, right?


00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.760
Right, yeah.


00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.520
V and then VII.


00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.960
Oh, come on.


00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.800
That's-- it's five times seven.


00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.400
Whatever.


00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.560
I can't do Roman numeral multiplicative math.


00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.120
So I'm done.


00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.440
I can't create an account apparently, but we are


00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.440
Roman.


00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.080
Let's look it up.


00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.360
Roman 35.


00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.520
It has to multiply.


00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.400
It has to be two numbers that multiply


00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.960
in your password should multiply the 35.


00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.920
So like seven and it's like seven and five.


00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.080
Yeah.


00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.720
That's what I thought.


00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:53.560
I thought I did VII and V or is that maybe like, I can't get rid of the M.


00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.040
Oh yeah.


00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.400
It says there's a problem with the M cause that's may I got to do a lowercase.


00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.040
There we go.


00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.000
Thank you, Pat.


00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Right.


00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
No, thank you, Mike.


00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.800
So I had may capitalized because it's a formal


00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.680
noun, but it was being treated as a regular one.


00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.000
Must include this captcha.


00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Okay.


00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
You got to type it.


00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Yeah.


00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Let's go, keep going.


00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.840
Five, four, and six, and.


00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.560
But now my digits don't add up anymore and there


00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.000
were digits, there were digits in the captcha.


00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.400
I must include today's word only.


00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.400
Okay.


00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.400
I'm done.


00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.400
I'm done.


00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.080
- Done, I'm out, I'm out.


00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:31.920
- This is good.


00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.020
- Yeah.


00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.860
- Nice.


00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.200
- I personally just use a proper password manager


00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.480
and let it guess.


00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.320
- Yeah, or--


00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.140
- I don't come up with one.


00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:41.980
- Yeah.


00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.840
- Or Kenny Longins.


00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.940
- Kenny Longins, it's always there for you.


00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.180
(laughing)


00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:50.280
- Oh, look--


00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.480
- Talk to me, Goose, talk to me, come on.


00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.960
- Oh, look at the bottom.


00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.480
Look at all the old computers and stuff at the bottom.


00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.320
You got a Commodore.


00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.140
- Oh, I love it.


00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:02.140
like an Atari 2600 joystick.


00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.900
- Well, this was a great episode.


00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.900
Nice funny passwords at the end.


00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.100
- Indeed.


00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.700
- Thanks a lot again.


00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.820
And we'll talk next week.


00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.660
- Yeah, thanks.


00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.480
See you later.


00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.320
Thanks everyone.


00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:25.320
