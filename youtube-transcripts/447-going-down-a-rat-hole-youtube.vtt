00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:02.120
Hey, everybody. Hey, Michael.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.300
Hello.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.620
Wonderful to be on this September 1st and do another podcast.

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.540
So, you ready?

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:11.720
I am so ready. Let's do it.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.460
All right. Hello and welcome to...

Try again.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.840
Where are we again? Is it the weekend?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.880
I mean, we're messing this up. Come on, Brian. Let's do it.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.080
It's a holiday.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.160
It is.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.780

All right, Michael, what are we starting with today?

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.080
You know, I'm afraid.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.180
I'm really afraid, Brian.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.240
I'm sorry, but I might be taking us down a rat hole.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.500
I really might.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.320
Oh, no.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.780
I want to talk about Rattle, this tool.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.960
So Rattle is a â€“ you probably have heard of Ngrok.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.680
right? Yeah. We've talked about it. Yeah, we've talked about it before and it's super useful.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.680
One of the things that is a real big challenge a lot of times is I need to let somebody or

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:16.620
something access an API. Let me give you two really big examples that are useful for this.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.319
One is webhooks. You want to do e-commerce or, but it doesn't really matter. Anything that has

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.720
to do with a webhook where you're on the receiving end, you're creating the webhook.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.420
That's a public website or service that's going to call your webhook.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.640
It needs a public page to access that.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.440
Well, do you want to like try to open up all the different firewalls on your machine and

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.660
your NAT router and then map an IP address and then give that to that thing?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.480
No, just don't do that.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:00.400
But you need somewhere where you can type in a URL and say, here's my URL for the web hook when a signup happens or a thing, whatever, right?

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.420
Whatever the web hook's triggering.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.260
Yeah.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.960
So you need a public thing.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:19.240
So with ingrock and Rathole and other tools, what you can do is you can say, create me based on this domain, basically an SSH tunnel or something to that equivalent that goes back into my machine.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.440
So that then you can share that URL and basically say, I want that port to map over to my web app.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:35.040
And you can literally run PyCharm, set a breakpoint, go to the external service, make it do a thing.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.180
And then boom, you're debugging through and you're checking it out.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.220
It's really, really nice.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.220
So Incroc is great, but people may have noticed I'm on this self-hosting rattle itself, if you will.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.320
So I don't know.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.540
There's just something about Ngrok.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.380
They've changed their services a bunch,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.680
and I'm not super psyched about it.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.160
So I'm like, well, what else is out there?

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.340
And Chad and I had a little conversation about it,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.920
and we decided that this is one of the really nice high-parity features,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.920
also written in Rust, more high-performance

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.420
than some of the other ones like FRP and Ngrok, it calls out.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.740
Okay.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.260
So what I did is I set this up onto my machine,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.720
onto my server, the same one that runs Python bytes,

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.440
and just said, they just run the background.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.140
And I've set up the certificates

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.300
so that I can just type rat hole with a port number.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.580
You know, on my terminal, I just open up

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.600
and say rat hole like 3000, or let's say rat hole 5000.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.600
And then I have a port, port map, URL map,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.460
automatically over to like say any Flask app that I run.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.720
How cool is that?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.320
And it's completely self-hosted.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.540
And here's the thing.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.200
You might think, oh, self-hosted, all the stuff

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.880
you've got to deal with.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.960
It's a single Rust binary that runs in Docker.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.620
And let me see.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.280
I'll give you up to the date stats if I can find them,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.080
if it's not going to take too long.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.200
Last time I checked, it was about three megabytes of memory usage.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.240
What is the rat hole doing right now?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.060
Oh my god, the rat hole is out of control.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.140
It's up to 11 megabytes of memory usage.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.100
on a 16 gigabyte machine.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.100
I think it's going to be okay.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.340
Isn't that cool though?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.780
So it's just got like a Docker container

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.880
that I didn't even have to do any Docker stuff.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.560
I just set up like a little compose file

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.560
to map all the settings over

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.740
so that I don't have to deal with like passing them

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.900
every time I run it, you know,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.820
and just set it up as an auto start daemon.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.920
But yeah, I just set that up and off it goes.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.300
Cool.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.680
No, so when you're not using it, do you turn it off,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.040
or is it just always sort of running?

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.020
If it took a lot of memory or resources or something,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.840
I would turn it off, but it's 11 megabytes.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.240
Okay.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.920
And so it's really low.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.100
Let me give you a sense of other stuff that's running on the server.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.380
So right now we have MongoDB, which is using 1.3 gigabytes.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.880
We have Talk Python, which is using 927 megabytes, so a gigabyte.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.140
What's Python bytes is running at 590 megabytes.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:31.860
So, you know, like 11 out of these is like it doesn't even show up on the radar, right?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.000
Like you couldn't even notice if it's running or not.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.760
And so because of that, no, I just leave it running.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.000
Okay.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.059
And then like, but on your, okay, so it's running something on your server

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.480
and then something on your laptop also?

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.240
Yeah, so there's a command that you can run locally.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.960
And I think I don't have it set up on my streaming computer.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.180
I have it on my dev one.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.960
So I can't look at it real quick,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.240
but I'm pretty sure I just set it up to run the Docker image,

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.820
just sharing ports in the right way.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.220
So I just do a Docker run command to say,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.560
share that port to this port when I do the map command.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.860
And so I don't even really have it installed.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.140
But yeah, it's just a super small binary that runs.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.420
Okay.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.640
This sounds really neat.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.320
I like it.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.440
Yeah, it's a tiny bit of a pain to set up,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.280
but it's not too bad.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.060
All right.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.400
Well, I want to shift gears completely.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.880
I guess something else that sometimes is a pain, maybe.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.540
I'm trying to do a transition here.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.280
Let's talk about pre-commit.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.340
So I know we've talked about pre-commit,

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.280
but I don't think we've brought it up lately.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.420
And one of the things is I used to use it a ton,

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.580
and then I moved a lot of my tooling to CI

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.540
and don't run it as much anymore.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.780
However, I'm going back to using it a lot.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.600
So pre-commit, just as a reminder, it's a tool.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.640
Well, there's this notion of pre-commit,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.360
which is a pre-commit hook for Git,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.200
so that whenever you commit something,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.060
you can assign pre-commit hooks.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.180
There's a project called pre-commit,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:15.220
which is something that's written in Python,

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:23.120
but it allows you to easily set up a whole bunch of these pre-commit GitHub hooks.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.880
So Python project and the hook thing.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.140
Okay, so why am I bringing that in?

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.080
And you can do things like hook up linters,

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.400
and you can run tests and stuff,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.640
but I generally don't do that as a pre-commit hook.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.840
I'll do linters and other stuff like that.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.599
I don't think I would ever set up tests as a pre-commit hook.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.960
Because whatever you want to, I mean, I guess you'd say disable the hooks to check in the fix for the hook.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.880
And they're slow.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:52.980
And there's just a lot to it.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.500
But yeah, I agree with the stuff.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:55.480
Okay.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:55.820
Yeah.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:04.940
So one of the things is pre-commit doesn't by default have a official way to use uv.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.600
It doesn't natively support uv.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.780
And I, like a lot of people, are using uv to install stuff because it's just so fast.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.020
Instead of pip install, I do a uv pip install.

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:25.520
So what we're talking about is an article from Adam Johnson talking about pre-commit install with uv.

00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:32.260
And as he puts it, the installation guide for pre-commit isn't obvious.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.580
It's not terrible, but it's not obvious how to get things set up.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:42.340
But he's recommending using uv tool install pre-commit with pre-commit uv.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.840
So this is another project called pre-commit-UV.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.400
And this is a couple of things.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:53.080
This is both an extra thing for pre-commit.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.960
But yeah, I guess that's it.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.220
It's a plug-in for pre-commit.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:01.820
But so what you're getting with this is you're installed.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:08.080
if you do uv tool install you're installing pre-commit uh with uv but then you're also

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:14.260
all the extra things so these extra tools like hooks for linters and all this sort of stuff

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:21.280
that gets installed with pre-commit with pip normally but this extra pre-commit uv will allow

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:26.160
it so that all of your tools are installed if they're python based tools get installed with uv

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.600
as well. So essentially just speeding up this whole tool chain. And if you switch around with

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:39.480
a bunch of projects, it makes sense to be able to update that stuff quickly and install it quickly.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:47.520
So there we go. I love it. uv for the win. I'm actually talking with Charlie Marsh tomorrow,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:56.120
but talking about pyx, the server side equivalent of uv. So that's cool. I'll be looking forward to

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:56.500
of that one.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.080
Another thing that is pretty awesome

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.360
is our sponsor, DigitalOcean.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:05.580
Absolutely.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.360
Let me tell you about DigitalOcean.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.220
Definitely a big fan of theirs.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.740

There's 300 services.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.260
How do I put them together?

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.800
It's nice and simple and powerful.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.020

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.480
What does affordable mean?

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.520
VMs start at $4 a month.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.380
$4.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.040
This might be relevant to my next topic, actually, Brian.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.580
And GPUs start under $1 an hour.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:53.040

It's a clickable chapter URL as you're hearing the segment.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.620
And it's at the top of the episode page at pythonbytes.fm.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.960
Thank you to DigitalOcean for supporting Python Bytes.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:30.900
Love it.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.980
Definitely love it.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:41.820
Also, I love that Python 3.14 is going to come out here pretty soon.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.220
I guess soon in the relative sense.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.100
We had a couple months left, I guess.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.720
It's almost Christmas for Python.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:50.660
Python Christmas.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.300
So I can't remember the timing.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.440
We've done this a few years in a row on the yearly,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.520
but I still don't remember.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.860
But anyway, I'm already starting to use 3.14,

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.420
and I'm excited about it.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.340
But one of the new things that's coming up with Python,

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.020
with the new one version,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.160
is Funktools Placeholder.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.360
And honestly, I saw something about it, and I was like, huh?

00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:19.540
And so let's go look at it.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.540
Is this when you just, I don't really want to write a function.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.740
I'll just put a little functools placeholder on it.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:26.700
No.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.180
I thought of it as kind of a stand-in for the dot, dot, dot, or pass,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.600
or whatever, when you just write a function.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.940
And then I read it more, and I'm like, oh, no, this is something else.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:37.100
Tell us about it.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.420
So I am a fan of functools partial.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.620
And again, it's a little obscure.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.440
So, okay, a little rabbit hole or rat hole here.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.840
So partial is a cool way to create a new function

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.820
by partially binding some parameters of another function.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.180
So let's say you've got a function that takes like six parameters

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.780
and you want to have everybody use it,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.220
but fill in the same thing for the four of the parameters.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.840
You can fill those in with partial and return a function that only takes two parameters.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:15.440
And then your users can, or the users of your API can use a cleaner interface with just a couple.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.520
Now, it's so cool.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:30.720
However, it's got some limitations that sometimes positional parameters, it works great for keywords, but for positional parameters, that's hard to decide which one to fill it in.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.400
So it doesn't work on all functions.

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:34.680
Enter placeholder.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.720
So placeholder is the ability to just say, this is where I want it to go.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:48.000
And if I've got a partial, like if I want to pass print, like bind the print function,

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:56.900
I want the first two to be placeholder, and I want the last one to be world so that I can pass in hello, dear, and have that come out.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.040
Okay, that seems a little trivial.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.800
So I was still trying to get a good example.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:09.120
And the good example came from Rodrigo from MathsPP.com.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:16.300
And his example, which is perfect, is to remove punctuation with a function.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.580
And he's got a little example.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:30.979
I've got his Bluesky post to use placeholder and partial to use translate and make trans to fill in this partial thing

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.760
to create a partial function that removes punctuation.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.880
And then you just have a function that you say,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.080
hey, remove the punctuation from Hello World.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.140
And it takes out the comma and the exclamation point.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.680
Something like that is great

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.380
because this whole removing punctuation thing,

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.260
that comes up.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.180
Or removing, you know, I've got,

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:53.360
I'm doing Markdown episodes for my podcast.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.900
I'm converting to Markdown.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.460
But the Hugo doesn't like colons in your title.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.760
So you got to remove the colons.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.400
that sort of thing.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.340
This is great.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.980
And then he also has an article to go with it,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.720
how to use Functools placeholder,

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:09.540
where he kind of walks through basically

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:12.880
what I just talked about is partial is great,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.120
but it doesn't always work.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.920
So placeholder comes to the rescue.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:20.180
So awesome write up about the new placeholder functionality.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.660
So thanks, Rodrigo.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:23.060
Interesting.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:23.439
Yeah.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.459
Thanks for helping me understand that a little better.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.640
I don't use Functools.partial really very much.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.360
So placeholder, which enhances that, doesn't give me a lot of clarity on it.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.840
Oh, I use it a lot.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:42.220
I mean, not a lot, a lot, but there's a lot of times where a built-in function does almost

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.080
everything I need, except for that I need to pass in a bunch of preset stuff.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.500
And I want to expose that as an API.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.720
And you can wrap it, but you can also just do a partial.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.180
It's cool.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.080
Yeah.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.160
All right.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.340
All right.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.440
This was going to be a little extra.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.060
Just a tiny thing I threw at the end.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.120
- Okay.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.860
- And then it grew and it grew and it grew

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.100
and it became more and more.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.940
So let me, so here's the headline.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.040
I converted the other night,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:29.640
160 old blog posts from wordpress.com

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.880
Oh, okay, good.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.280
Okay.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.220
And this is something that has been absolutely driving me nuts for years.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.360
I've had all these posts over on blog.michaelckennedy.net,

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.600
which is the domain I happened to be able to get at the time.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.880
And they were on WordPress with this custom theme and so on.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.280
And I was just done with WordPress.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:54.920
Every time I went there, it was just like an antidote against writing.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.980
Like I just don't want to write here.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:57.800
Like why am I doing it?

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.080
Like, I would much rather write markdown and just have simple and clean code like my current website.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.600
We've talked a lot about using Hugo.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.500
Like, you use Hugo.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.120
I use Hugo.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.980
My mkennedy.code site is Hugo.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:10.300
All right?

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:16.560
But how do I get stuff from WordPress.com over to Hugo?

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.160
Well, guess what?

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.180
There's an export feature in WordPress.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.920
But if you have the paid WordPress account,

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.280
which is what you need to have your own domain

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.620
and not your username.wordpress.com,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.420
there's different tiers.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.000
Well, you have to pay the $200 version

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.380
to get the export feature turned on.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:40.480
What?

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.440
Yes.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.180
That's like multiple levels up.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.760
I'm like, oh, these guys are holding my stuff hostage.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.300
Screw them.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.580
I'm just going to just put my last blog post over there

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.060
we've moved to this place.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.640
Please join me there.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.220
You know what I mean?

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:55.980
Yeah.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.200
I'm like, but then I got a renewal for 50 bucks or 48 bucks.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.260
I really don't want to just keep paying for the rest of my life,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.380
$48 to this thing, you know?

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.040
So I'm like, but it's just too much work to move it over.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:11.220
Right.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.220
Without an export, I could have paid that as well,

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:18.540
but then I'd still have to migrate it from HTML and WordPress export format

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.740
to, to markdown.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.520
So I'm like, I don't really, but then I'm like, you know what?

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.580
Let me just fire up cursor and just say cursor over there.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:26.340
I want this stuff.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800
I want it over here into Hugo.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.740
And I showed it my, I like opened the Hugo page in cursor or the Hugo site in

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.580
cursor and I said, here's the URL, go get it.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.300
And I said, I'm on it.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.600
And within like five minutes, it had all the posts move over.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:40.560
I'm like, this is amazing.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.400
But it only based it off the RSS feed, which is totally reasonable.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:54.360
But the WordPress site limits the amount of content in the RSS feed to 50, not all my posts.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.880
I'm like, oh, where are they?

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:57.400
Rats.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.500
I got some of them, but not all of them.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:09.060
And so then I just said, hey, go back after it and give me, just start scraping the thing, right?

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.140
And so it just started web scraping the other pieces.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.020
And I told it to download all the images, all those kind of things.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:16.820
And it did it.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.760
It took a couple iterations, like it downloaded the comments.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.040
I'm like, no, I don't want the comments.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.420
I'm sorry.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.500
I should have told you no comments.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.840
But eventually, it took it out.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:31.180
And so now if you go to posts, I've got like 200 posts over here going back to 2006.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.700
But like here, let me see if I can find one like this.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.160
Let's just do something that I'll call.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.820
This is definitely going to come up.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.220
Let's search this.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:46.500
Okay.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.240
and I also put the domain I put the URL path so normally for all my real my real

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.160
posts I wrote on Hugo they're like /post/whatever but I put all the

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:04.000
archived ones in /post/r/whatever so that I can just look at oh that's an

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.720
archive post if for whatever reason okay now but if we go over here and search

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.760
you can see somewhere in here I'm sure that oh maybe it's if I search for that

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:24.940
and Kenny, oh gosh that's really bad. I'm about to search for something else. But if I find one

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.320
of these you'll see that this one's definitely gonna come up surely this is there's no way that

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:38.440
I can't remember why I wrote this article. Doesn't really matter. There we go. So notice it's a blog

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.080
michaelckennedy.net 2011-01-19.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.000
You know, the date.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.940
This is like WordPress style and then the name.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:50.540
But if I hit it, boom, instantly mapped over.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.040
So I even gave people in the show notes

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.300
the Nginx configuration to rewrite all of those things.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.720
So now I'm just hosting my old domain

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.800
and I just have a really complicated

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.500
regular expression route match.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.520
that then pulls off that little last piece

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.240
and then sticks it on slash post slash R slash slug.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.460
Okay.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.160
A little different technique, but okay.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:19.860
Yeah.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:20.420
Okay.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.100
I'm interested to hear what you did,

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.380
but I got these all over there.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.160
They're all integrated into the search engine.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.520
So, like, if you hit NuGet or whatever, boom,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.540
get all these old things.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.760
I really don't care super tons about,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.720
but, you know, I wrote it.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.160
I don't want it to go away, right?

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.660
so a couple other noteworthy things

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.740
like I did not put this in

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.000
let me pull this up for a minute

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.600
there's

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:51.600
an article on Ars Technica

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.560
that just came out

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.580
this is one of the things that got me going

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:55.760
just like a couple days ago

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.080
it says blogging service type pad is shutting down

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.660
taking all content

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.500
from all users

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:03.880
from all time away with it

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.180
wow

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.480
There were a bunch of artists that I followed that used TypeAd for a long time.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:12.960
Yeah.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.000
And that's not good, is it?

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.320
If that was you.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.060
And so this points out, like, if you don't have your own domain,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.220
if I was, I don't really remember what my username was,

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.180
mkennedy.wordpress.com.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.180
I don't think that's what it was.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.440
But whatever it is, if that was what your domain was,

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.680
your content is gone and you have no choice whatsoever

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.060
if the server shuts down.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.280
forever, right?

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.820
Because you can't remap that domain.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.700
You don't own WordPress.com or typepad.com.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:43.520
Right.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.520
And I'm just, you know, looking around.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.000
There's some other places that might want to,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.320
oh, hold on, that didn't copy.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.180
There's some other places

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.520
that might want to take that to heart.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.840
For example, the PSF.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.160
Blogspot, I know.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.100
It's pyfound.blogspot.com.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.780
I know we have some people

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.400
who are full-time employees

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.660
making an amazing impact at the PSF.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.600
We have Luca Schlinger,

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.160
developer in residence,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.740
South Michael Larson,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.120
Mike Fiedler.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.880
There's an opportunity for somebody to go,

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.900
let's get our own custom domain here

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.420
and just leave it on Blogspot.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.480
But if for some reason,

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.220
Blogspot shuts down just like TypePad did,

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.420
it's going to be quite the bad time.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.320
So anyway,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:43.060
yeah what else do I have to add to this um nothing I don't have anything to add I just think

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:49.700
if you feel like your stuff has been out there trapped and been hostage you can not only get it

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:56.100
out but you can really carefully decide like I want it to appear my new setup exactly like this

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:03.780
like I want it under slash r for archived and also if you go to my rss feed the older posts don't

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.580
show up in RSS, but the newer ones do.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.940
Because I don't want people to just go, whoa, where did 160

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.900
new posts come from, and why are they 10 years

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:10.200
old?

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:10.900
You know what I mean?

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.660
So I think there's a lot of flexibility here.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.300
And it used to be like it was not worth it.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.940
But if you just fire up an agentic AI and let it go on it,

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:21.980
it might be worth it.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:22.920
Because it's not that.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.240
I think I wrote down in the notes, it took me three to four

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:25.960
hours to do this.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:32.240
And to me, that felt like, OK, my content has been held hostage

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:37.860
by wordpress.com and i finally you know i sent in like seal team six and we got it out without

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:44.340
actually paying the ransom sort of it's kind of how i feel about it anyway what did you do for

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:52.180
yours because you moved yours around as well right yeah um so i let me um i'll pop over and show you

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.220
are we into extras now i guess we'll just we are into extras i'm done with this topic anyway how's

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:07.960
that okay well um i'll i'll show you at least um this uh this little bit so over at python test.com

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:15.660
so not that one um i have a under the extras i got test and code archive so i took i'm i did an

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:22.400
archive of all of all of testing code 200 and i'm missing episode one so it's 237 episodes

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:29.460
off by one error i kind of like that anyway um so uh in each of these is of course there it's

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:38.200
a markdown file um and uh the how to how to get all this so this is this is like um the same

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:46.960
similar similar url if i were the old testing code is still up and if i go to to that episode

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.260
that so long it's saying episodes so long and thanks for all the fish that's there and then over

00:27:52.480 --> 00:28:04.180
it um uh at the archive it's this sort of sort of the same url um for for that episodes but if i

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:11.300
want to redirect it um like if somebody just types in 237 or 238 that's supposed to work also so i've

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.740
I've got it set up to do that.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.020
I think 238 works.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:23.040
And also, even if they just go to the top level of that,

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.320
I think that works.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.660
And that's done with aliases.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.880
So I didn't do it.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.620
I did it with Markdown or Hugo aliases.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.320
I didn't do it with something else.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.500
And then eventually, probably next week,

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.060
I'm going to redirect the top-level testing code

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.240
to the archive page.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:47.740
Yeah.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.660
What are the archive pages?

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.400
This top-level pythontest.com slash testing code.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:54.260
Yeah, perfect.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.400
And then anything after that will just redirect to wherever.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.400
So that's how I'm doing that.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:01.940
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.620
I didn't do the people thing yet, and I don't know if I will.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.540
So I had like all of the different people had their own little page.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.760
But there's not much there other than social links and stuff.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.400
So I might just do that.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.380
So anyway.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.060
Yeah, that's what it worked.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.220
But I also had, I almost had it working,

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.500
but I had a hard time finding all of these original links

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.940
because the feed XML that I downloaded was incorrect.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:44.360
And I popped open Copilot with using Claude Sonnet 4 or something like that

00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:48.980
and said, hey, I'm trying to import this.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.020
Can I get you write a Python script to grab all the links?

00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:00.440
And it said, oh, I'm trying to, but the XML is corrupted.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.720
But it worked around it and did it anyway with just parsing the file,

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:11.780
which was kind of ugly.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.160
But I'm like, hey, I just need to get this done in like five minutes.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.260
Yeah.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.220
You don't ever need to keep that code.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.200
Once it's done, it's done.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:18.880
Yeah.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.640
A lot of people will say things like, oh, I can't believe you would use AI for this.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.140
You know those things make up stuff and whatever.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.840
And it's like when it wrote the program,

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.120
it's either going to migrate it over successfully or not.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.540
You can look at the article and see is the content there

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.380
Is it all out of whack or does it look fine?

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.540
And if it's fine, who cares?

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.520
There's no tech debt.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.140
There's none of that because I'm never going to run that again.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.640
I literally remapped the DNS and it's gone.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.280
I deleted my paid account and it's gone.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:52.840
And I needed to update like 237 Markdown files.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.320
And I just, I'm probably going to,

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.960
if I have to make modifications to them later, I'll do it one off.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.260
Like I'll just do a search and replace for everything.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.720
And which that's what I did also.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.800
So I had these like link to the episode archive and also the feed URL.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.840
I'm like, oh, I should have added those in.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.320
Well, I just did a search and replace on all the files and did that.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.380
I didn't ask Claude to do that for me.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.940
But so there's all sorts of fun stuff.

00:31:19.639 --> 00:31:24.440
And thanks to DigitalOcean, the new episodes are hosted.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.400
Sorry about that.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.760
The new episodes are hosted on DigitalOcean Spaces.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.740
Oh, is that where you put them?

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.600
Yeah, I have a ton of stuff hosted on DigitalOcean Spaces.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.120
And anytime you see something like blobs.pythonbytes.fm,

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.220
that's DigitalOcean Spaces as well.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:45.100
So that went down from like, what, 20 bucks a month,

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.940
which isn't terrible that I was paying before,

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.040
down to a whopping $5 a month with DigitalOcean Spaces.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.540
So that's great.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:53.960
And you have the freedom.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.900
Now it's in Hugo.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.880
You can do whatever you want.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.060
Exactly.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:58.140
All right.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.900
So that was one of my extras was,

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.020
hey, the testing code is finally archived over.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.060
Yeah, I'm glad you decided to keep that around.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.540
That's a ton of work, and having that around for historical reasons is good.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.240
And I probably am going to do, to get off Transistor altogether,

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.140
Python people.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.460
I got to do pythonpeople.fm, but I don't remember how many.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:19.800
Oops.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:21.980
Python people.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.160
It's like, what, 14 episodes.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.340
I could do that by hand if I had to.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.700
so that's not going to be bad

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.520
okay the other extra that I wanted to talk about

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.320
was just a really fun thing

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:37.420
that Seth Larson brought up

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.980
so Seth Larson put a

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.460
post up for SMS

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:44.480
URLs and he said did you know

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.320
that you can like the mail to

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.300
URL you can do SMS

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.400
and if

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.580
I'm not going to click on this because it won't do anything

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:52.860
on my

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.200
laptop I don't think

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.419
it's also Hollywood

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:06.240
it no yeah um but if you do it on your phone um it'll just it'll open up an sm like a it'll open

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:13.520
up your sms app your uh text messaging app and fill it in with hello world which is cool so this

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:20.280
whole fill in thing why is this neat well that so this is it's fun anyway it's just fun for one but

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:26.540
also um uh wouldn't it be cool if you could just type in one of the things you can do with urls is

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.260
you can create QR codes.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.380
So Seth also wrote this draft and SMS message

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:35.900
from any computer keyboard

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:37.440
because you can just go to a computer

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.120
and type stuff in here

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.960
and it generates a QR code.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.080
And the fun thing is,

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:43.760
is as you're typing,

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.020
the QR changes.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.320
That is wild.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.900
I love it.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:48.220
Yeah.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.060
Watch this.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.200
So if you take like a bunch of lorem ipsum

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.660
and drop it in there,

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:54.920
you get like this.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:03.480
look at that dense qr code oh gosh you need a high-res print out of that

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.600
yeah but then so what you do is you just point your so you you don't even have to have sms you

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:14.120
could anywhere you can be at a work computer and even just type this in it doesn't save it

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:22.919
anywhere and then you just um uh snap the qr code with your phone and it opens up your um your text

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:32.139
messages so um it's pretty fun yeah uh i just thought that was neat also uh i still use lauram

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:42.300
ipsum all the time so shout out to lauramipsum.com for stuff anyway yeah i prefer the um the hipster

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:52.060
ipsum hipster ipsum have you seen it oh i don't know hipster ipsum me um yeah hit it give that give

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.879
that a little bit of a read.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.659
Oh, yeah.

00:34:55.899 --> 00:34:57.860
I'm baby post-ironic green juice

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.200
Put a bird on it, mutt.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.520
Put a bird on it, man.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.160
Bun. Oh, this is good.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.480
Yeah. I'll have to do this.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.880
I don't know. I just get tired

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.600
of looking at Lauren Mipson all the time. I'm like,

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.680
let's just throw some

00:35:18.539 --> 00:35:19.260
cupping kinfolk.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.620
Butcher next level plus one waistcoat

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.500
Venmo same Franzen

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:27.560
microdosing

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:30.940
Farmed a table

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.400
microdosing

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.040
Vaporware

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.640
Yeah this is good

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:37.900
It's pretty good yeah but same basic ideas

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.660
8-bit literally

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:41.620
Yeah

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.640
Nice

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.000
No that's my extras

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.139
But we've got one big extra

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.680
oh yeah we do this is the big one

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.600
so the

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.920
Python the documentary

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.440
an origin story is out

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.360
and it's a one hour 24

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:01.480
minute

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.380
highly produced very entertaining

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:05.920
documentary

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.240
with

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.420
many friends of the show people have been on

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.200
your other shows Brian

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.900
like your Python people a lot of them

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.240
are here right

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.120
yeah

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.020
Same for Talk Python as well.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.340
And I am really looking forward to watching this.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.100
It came out a couple days ago, and I'm like, oh, I could watch it.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.380
But I actually think what would be really fun,

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.780
I would love to just hear your first impression of this.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.420
I think it would be fun to do a group watch through

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.140
and set up some kind of chat, like a Discord chat or something,

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.980
for whoever wants to watch it all together and hasn't seen it yet.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.820
I think that would be kind of cool and just have a chat going in parallel

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.780
to watching it, something like that.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.440
So kind of like people do with keynotes every now and then and so on.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:54.240
So I don't know.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.320
I'm contemplating the logistics of that.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.060
If I can come up with a good idea on the next day or two, then I'll do that.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.120
Otherwise, I'll just watch it.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.380
Well, I mean, when it first came out, they did like a chat thing.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.100
Yeah, it came out as a premiere, I believe, and you can see the chat replay.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:15.800
But how many people who would want to watch this actually watched it during its premiere?

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:16.980
You know, probably not that many.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.160
yeah so i just got rid of my inflatable screen too we could have done it in like a cul-de-sac

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:28.100
or something oh you had one of those big oh that's awesome yeah during the pandemic we had like this

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.760
what 20 foot 23 foot screen or something like that um so yeah that's actually a really good idea

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:42.220
we didn't have that well you suck i guess i don't know actually um we have a covered outdoor area

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:48.100
in the back now and I ended up, long story, ended up with an extra 50 inch flat screen TV

00:37:50.279 --> 00:37:53.860
and bought it for my dad and it turns out he didn't need it anymore. So I got it back. I'm

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.080
like, what am I going to do this? I'm like, we're sticking this outside. So we've got a little,

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.780
little area, but it's not a 20 foot screen. Like that's, that's the next level business right there.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.560
I don't remember how big it was. It was probably that big, big inflatable thing.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:11.500
It's bigger than a regular TV. That's awesome. Anyway, if I recommend people watch this,

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.720
We talked about the trailer when it came out, and it was really good, wasn't it?

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:15.760
Yeah.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.420
So I was hoping to get this watched before we recorded.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.060
Did you happen to watch any of this?

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:21.580
No.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:22.420
I'm trying.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.840
I'm just like, I'm delaying it because I want to try to figure out something fun for a group.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.020
That'd be fun.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:28.380
Cool.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.060
Now I don't feel bad about not watching it yet.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.520
I watched like a few minutes, and I was like, oh, it's an hour and a half.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.400
I'm going to have to set aside some time to do this.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.860
And looking up, I think I've got like,

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:42.040
you probably have all of these interviews on Talk Python.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.960
I think I've got half of the people shown on the opening screen.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.640
Yeah, there's maybe eight or nine people.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.840
I think almost everyone.

00:38:53.479 --> 00:38:56.300
I think there's one person I don't necessarily recognize

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.040
through the little thin slice.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.200
But yeah, I would say other than that,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.100
yeah, everyone's been on the show.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:00.900
That's cool.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:01.540
Cool.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:03.860
Well, cool.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.800
Can't wait to watch it.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:05.420
All right.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.360
Are you ready to laugh?

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:07.320
Yeah.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.580
Let the hilarity ensue.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:08.940
We'll see.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.020
I can't remember what I came up with.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:10.620
Oh, yeah.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.660
So this one is like a Jedi.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:14.380
Think.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.960
I want to just put you in the mindset before we get to it.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.380
Okay, Brian?

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:19.240
Okay.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.300
You're on Tatooine.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.000
You've been told of this Obi-Wan Kenobi who you must find.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:31.660
You know the old wizard man out past the cantina.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:42.780
So it says, the joke is, it has Obi-Wan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and it says, when you read some incredibly bad code thinking, what moron wrote this?

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.000
But halfway through, it starts to become familiar.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.100
Well, of course I know him.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:47.820
He is me.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:49.480
Yeah.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.080
Do you know this Obi-Wan?

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.260
Yes, of course I know him.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.020
Do you know the bad wizard who wrote the bad code?

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:57.940
Of course I know him.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:58.640
He is me.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:00.480
Yeah.

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:02.720
Actually, yeah.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:09.380
it's usually that i really love it when it's not me but it's usually me i'm the problem pull up

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:18.120
get blamed because you're like i'm gonna oh no oh no yeah i really like that yeah it's it's

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:24.500
addictive but i i like have i have blame on every line turned on vs code so that whatever whatever

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:31.600
i'm working on i'm like who did this oh yeah yeah yeah it's kind of nice it's kind of nice but i'm

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.540
It's also just the last person that touched that line as well.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.460
So sometimes it's me, even if I didn't write the logic.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:39.300
Right.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.740
It could be something so simple as you ran Ruff format

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.000
and then committed the change.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:43.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.140
Now it's yours, yeah.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.200
All right.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.560
Anyway, of course I know him.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.100
He is me.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.140
Of course I know him.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.000
All right.
