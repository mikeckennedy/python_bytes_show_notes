<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, finally.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, exactly. It's been bumped and bumped.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Brian puts that together every week and sends it out.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.600
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's got more than just a rehashing of the show notes.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Michael Kennedy>It's got a bunch of extra info.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.080
<v Michael Kennedy>So that's always fun.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Brian, one of the reasons, there are many reasons that we are on an alternate schedule this week.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Michael Kennedy>I had a very, very dark time fall upon House Kennedy.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.119
<v Michael Kennedy>There were people, I live where there are tons of tall trees.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.860
<v Michael Kennedy>In Oregon, there are tall trees, but I live especially where there are many tall trees, like right along the street.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Michael Kennedy>And so that we don't get the power taken out by these trees.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Michael Kennedy>In the winter, the power company goes along and trims back the trees.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, the geniuses at the top of that thing cut through the fiber optic cable that provided power to my house.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And I have one bar of LTE level of cell coverage at my house.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Michael Kennedy>So when that happened Sunday night or Sunday afternoon, and then we're supposed to record Monday morning, it was like, mm-mm.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.180
<v Brian Okken>That ain't happening.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Michael Kennedy>It ain't happening.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Michael Kennedy>So sorry, folks.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Michael Kennedy>That's a part of the reason why we're a little bit off schedule.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Michael Kennedy>But light has shone upon us again.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Michael Kennedy>The fiber is flowing.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.240
<v Brian Okken>And then, of course, we were going to do noon today.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.760
<v Brian Okken>And then I had a contractor that was supposed to be here at 3.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.540
<v Brian Okken>Showed up at quarter to noon.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Brian Okken>So we had to push back.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Michael Kennedy>There it is.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.620
<v Brian Okken>There it is.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, what have you got to push down to everyone listening?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Brian Okken>Well, I'm excited because one of the things we get to talk about that we wouldn't have been able to talk about if we were recording on Monday is that two days ago on Tuesday, Python 3.14 got released.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Brian Okken>And I wish I had some party poppers or something.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.780
<v Brian Okken>Pop, pop, pop.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.960
<v Brian Okken>Because I'm totally stoked about this.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.800
<v Brian Okken>I know.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.380
<v Brian Okken>So I don't know if other people are really excited, but there's some really cool stuff in 3.14 or the Py release.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Brian Okken>Py? P-I? I don't know.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Brian Okken>3.14.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Brian Okken>Are they going to do like for the bug fix releases instead of going like 3.4.0?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.180
<v Brian Okken>It's 3.14.0 right now, and then it'll go dot 1.2.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.080
<v Brian Okken>But I think it should go dot 1 and then 1.5 and then 1.5.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.460
<v Brian Okken>That'd be fun.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Brian Okken>Yes.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Come on.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's do it.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Michael Kennedy>It's still incrementing.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's do it.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Brian Okken>It's still, yeah, bigger.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.500
<v Brian Okken>Anyway.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.700
<v Michael Kennedy>We're guaranteed to not run out.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.360
<v Michael Kennedy>It's an irrational number that goes on forever.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.180
<v Michael Kennedy>It's going to be fine.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I think it would break some people to have a really long version.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.080
<v Brian Okken>Cutting into our logo.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Brian Okken>Okay, so I'm going to link to what's new in the release.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.140
<v Brian Okken>And there is a ton of stuff in here.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Brian Okken>So please check it out.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.120
<v Brian Okken>I think there's some great stuff.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.640
<v Brian Okken>I wanted to highlight a handful of things that I'm pretty excited about.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Brian Okken>Template string literals, and I have to admit, I still don't quite get it.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.240
<v Brian Okken>I'm going to have to do a project that actually uses template string literals, the new template strings.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Brian Okken>The prefix T instead of F, so t-strings, we call them t-strings?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.800
<v Brian Okken>I don't know.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes, we're calling t-strings.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.860
<v Michael Kennedy>I had Paul Everett and some other folks who I'm sorry, I'm forgetting on Talk Python last year to talk about it when it was proposed.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, t-strings.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.920
<v Brian Okken>Okay. I guess just go back and listen to that episode.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, excited to try this.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Brian Okken>And I think I am excited to see what people build on top of this as well.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.460
<v Brian Okken>Possibly we can have some cool stuff built on top of two strings.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.280
<v Brian Okken>What else?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.920
<v Brian Okken>This is pretty cool, actually.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Brian Okken>Seems kind of minor, but PEP758 is allow, accept, and accept star expressions without brackets.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.380
<v Brian Okken>So what's the deal here?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Brian Okken>Well, if you had multiple exceptions that you were catching, like in the example, they have timeout error and connection refused error.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.460
<v Brian Okken>Those had to be in brackets, but now they can just be just like there.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.360
<v Brian Okken>They're just, you don't have to have brackets.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.540
<v Brian Okken>It's a minor thing, but it saves typing.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Brian Okken>I love it.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.080
<v Brian Okken>Improved error messages, always better.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.740
<v Brian Okken>Like if you typed while with two Ls or something, more highlighting of where you have a syntax error.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.340
<v Brian Okken>Perfect.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.700
<v Brian Okken>More better tracebacks are always helpful.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.960
<v Brian Okken>What else?

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.160
<v Brian Okken>So one of the things that came in is some, oh, default interactive shell.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.940
<v Brian Okken>So the default, there's a couple of improvements to the shell.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:31.200
<v Brian Okken>So when you just, the rebel, when you type like Python or Python-I, whatever, the interactive thing, it's in color now.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Brian Okken>And one of the things is it's in color, and also it does syntax highlighting.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Brian Okken>So that's pretty cool.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.040
<v Brian Okken>I thought I had a screenshot.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.660
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Brian Okken>So fun to have colors in the REPL.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Brian Okken>I know there were other non-standard REPLs that did this, so I'm glad that the standard one does.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.460
<v Brian Okken>That's pretty cool.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.660
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, that's great.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.860
<v Brian Okken>What else we got?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.240
<v Brian Okken>I thought I had a couple other things.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.000
<v Brian Okken>The default and directive shell.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Brian Okken>In the improved modules, I'm actually pretty excited about the arg parse stuff.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:17.500
<v Brian Okken>The arg parse, if you're writing a command line interface tool like a CLI tool that takes arguments, you can use click or typer.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.520
<v Brian Okken>But the built-in one is arg parse, which I've been using more and more for small projects.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.400
<v Michael Kennedy>So have I.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Michael Kennedy>If it doesn't have a dependency, but you wanted to take arguments, just use arg parse.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:08:15.420
<v Brian Okken>so then uh a couple things the if name equals main or not so if you if you say python dash m and then your module your project um that didn't quite work right before or it was like i don't know i didn't i i didn't try it with our parts but apparently that's better now so that's cool couple the other thing that i'm pretty excited about is this uh suggest on error so This is a thing where you basically, if you type in a, it's not on by default, but if you turn it on and you pass an argument to your command line interface thing and you mistype it, it can say that isn't here, but did you mean?

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.180
<v Brian Okken>And I love that sort of feature, so that's pretty cool.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.020
<v Brian Okken>And then colored help text.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Brian Okken>That's pretty neat.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.440
<v Brian Okken>And what do I have?

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.940
<v Brian Okken>Oh, last thing I thought was just fun.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Brian Okken>there's a whole bunch of stuff check it out but the date, the calendar do you ever use this? Occasionally

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:42.039
<v Michael Kennedy>use the calendar module? I've never used the calendar. I know what it does but I've never used it. Okay so if you do

00:08:42.320 --> 00:09:31.120
<v Brian Okken>python-m calendar and then it has some flags and stuff you can use too. It just prints out the calendar but now with this release it highlights the current date so you can say like calendar 2025 10 for October 2025 and it highlights that it's the 9th today and if you do the if you just do the whole year it'll show you the whole year and it does the 9th so this is pretty handy if you just have a ripple around to if you're like when is the if somebody says hey can you meet on the 15th when is the 15th is it Tuesday whatever you pull this up so yeah that's pretty cool lots of great stuff check out the what's new and upgrade As an aside, I was going to get ready for today, but I didn't get a chance because of all the contractor stuff.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.920
<v Brian Okken>I'm going to get up.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:44.360
<v Brian Okken>Probably by the time you listen to this, I'll have an article up on Python test for all the changes you need to make sure you make to test your project for 3.14.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.160
<v Brian Okken>It's the normal stuff, but I figured I'd just write it down, and I'll do a post about that.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, looking forward to it.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.220
<v Michael Kennedy>I have a few follow-ups, a few rough edges.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:56.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.820
<v Michael Kennedy>I have one smooth, nice edge, and then a couple rough edges.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So the smooth edge is that Charlie Marsh announced that uv and rough both shipped Python 3.14 support the day 3.14 came out, which is pretty cool.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:23.920
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you uv, VE, and V, and you don't have anything installed, or if you specify 314, you'll get the 314.0 release, which is awesome.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.100
<v Michael Kennedy>But remember that you have to actually update the uv binary.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.020
<v Michael Kennedy>It doesn't look at a web service or something.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.660
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you've got an old uv that's not 0.9, it doesn't know about the new one.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.440
<v Brian Okken>So uv self-update, if you have it globally installed.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Which is how I do it, indeed.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, so that's the smooth edge.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.620
<v Michael Kennedy>The rough edge is for Python Bytes,

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.560
<v Brian Okken>I use uv loop for the async I/O operations on Python Bytes.fm.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, I thought, what the heck, let me just swap out the virtual environment locally and see what happens today.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Just try it out.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:10:59.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Why not?

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.220
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll be able to say we're using 3.14.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:01.960
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll just roll it out.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.980
<v Michael Kennedy>And then guess what?

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.420
<v Michael Kennedy>It didn't like it.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.000
<v Michael Kennedy>It crashed, and it literally wouldn't load the website.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Because apparently, uv does not support 3.14-- uv loop, rather.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.660
<v Brian Okken>Sorry, not uv, uv loop.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:17.760
<v Brian Okken>There are different things.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.160
<v Michael Kennedy>So uv loop is a way to speed up the asyncio event loop for async and await.

00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:26.060
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's been fine for a long time.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.880
<v Michael Kennedy>It was updated like three weeks ago, but it's not updated for this.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.360
<v Michael Kennedy>So I just took it out and said, you know what?

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.120
<v Michael Kennedy>We're just going to fall back.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Like Python's got a lot faster since I added that way, way back when.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Michael Kennedy>And so just run on the standard old asyncio event loop.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, it's a good thing you checked.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Brian Okken>But everybody that's got a project out there that other people are depending on.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:52.360
<v Brian Okken>Most of the Python versions that we roll to, there's no problems, but occasionally something you're doing might be an issue.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.020
<v Brian Okken>So please test and roll out new versions.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Michael Kennedy>I have another sharp edge for you.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.580
<v Michael Kennedy>I have no idea if this is true in VS Code, though it may be, but honestly, I haven't tried it.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:01.840
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Michael Kennedy>But in Cursor, I can tell you that you cannot debug something in Python 3.14.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:15.380
<v Michael Kennedy>You hit run, it says, cannot find underscore underscore handle crash or something along those lines, at least the projects that I tried.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.300
<v Michael Kennedy>So a few people got some updating to do.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.480
<v Brian Okken>Brian, here's the thing, though.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Wasn't this stuff available for like six months?

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.700
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, it's been available for a while.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.480
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, I'll give the uv loop guys a pass, right?

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Like that's not a main thing they're working on and like whatever.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe it needs testing.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.580
<v Michael Kennedy>But I mean, a product such like Cursor, they update that thing like daily.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.280
<v Michael Kennedy>There should probably have been somebody that tested that.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:50.100
<v Brian Okken>Also, before we move on, one of the things that I think projects should do, it's questionable whether you should bump your version.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Brian Okken>So if you've got a project that other people are depending on, and it just runs fine.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.620
<v Brian Okken>You run it locally, you test it on 3.14, and it works fine.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Brian Okken>Maybe you even turn on testing in CI at 3.14, but you didn't have to make any changes should you do another version.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:17.540
<v Brian Okken>And I think at least even a minor version bump so that you can add the Trove classifier to say this one runs on the new version.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:18.800
<v Brian Okken>I think it's worth it.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Brian Okken>It's also, I look, other people look, and if a project hasn't had a release in a few years or a couple years, I don't know that anybody's looking at it.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.700
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, it might be dead.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:38.600
<v Brian Okken>So I think once a year when we roll out new versions, that might be a time to bump your version just to let people know it's still alive and it's fine.

00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I agree with that.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.540
<v Michael Kennedy>That sounds cool.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.060
<v Michael Kennedy>All right, let's go back and talk about, you know, checking your libraries for versions that work.

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:51.320
<v Michael Kennedy>So I bring you here.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.240
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll zoom out a little so it looks a little better.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.680
<v Michael Kennedy>The Python compatibility checker for free threaded Python.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.020
<v Michael Kennedy>So this is a heat map of-- hover over it.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.060
<v Michael Kennedy>What do I get if I click that?

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:06.840
<v Michael Kennedy>It doesn't do anything.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.320
<v Michael Kennedy>You can click it.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.800
<v Michael Kennedy>But it's a heat map of the most popular libraries.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.460
<v Michael Kennedy>If I scroll down here somewhere, you can see it's got the most installed ones.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Michael Kennedy>So Boto3, Karset Normalizer, Yorlub3, Request, BotoCore, et cetera.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:30.000
<v Michael Kennedy>And most importantly, it tells you, is that thing thread safe in the sense that can I use it with Python T instead of Python?

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.380
<v Michael Kennedy>a free-threaded version of Python.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:40.040
<v Michael Kennedy>And I don't know, it's more blue than red, but there's still a lot of red out there.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.040
<v Brian Okken>- Yeah.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.680
<v Michael Kennedy>- There's failed, there's no data.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:15:02.580
<v Michael Kennedy>So I put this out there as a way for, if you're involved in the top couple thousand packages, maybe give this a look, see what they're testing, give Python 3.13, 3.14T a test, like work it into your test mix.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.280
<v Michael Kennedy>And if you don't want to support it, fine.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Like just be explicit about it.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:17.400
<v Michael Kennedy>But if there's just a super minor little threading issue or some condition or whatever, you know, it'd be cool if it would support it.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:22.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Like that's the primary reason that the 2 to 3 thing was so rough.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Michael Kennedy>It was like, not that we all couldn't decide I just start writing Python 3 style code.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:32.120
<v Michael Kennedy>It was like, well, the library I need to do this depends on a library that doesn't work in 3.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Michael Kennedy>And we've got a similar story for free threading here, although I suspect it's less.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, I present to you ft-checker.com, and you can see if the things that you care about support free threaded Python.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Tina, how many things are they checking?

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.760
<v Brian Okken>Oh, 500 things, top 500.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, I think I can scroll in.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Let me look.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.340
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it's the top 1,000.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:57.740
<v Brian Okken>Top 1,000.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:58.580
<v Brian Okken>Almost.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Like top 987.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe they couldn't get information about some of them.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.040
<v Brian Okken>Top 1,000.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:06.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Cool.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:06.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Cool.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.360
<v Michael Kennedy>And what else is cool?

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:10.720
<v Brian Okken>Thank you to DigitalOcean for supporting Python Bytes and for having an awesome service.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.240
<v Brian Okken>Absolutely.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.800
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, they do really good stuff.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Brian Okken>I just recently moved a bunch of stuff to, what do they call it, DigitalOcean Spaces

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.500
<v Michael Kennedy>to save some, store some things.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I was working at DigitalOcean Spaces 30 minutes before we started, like I said.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:26.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Very cool.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Good stuff.

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:32.100
<v Michael Kennedy>So was I using AI?

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:32.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Was I not, Brian?

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.580
<v Michael Kennedy>That's the question.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.400
<v Michael Kennedy>There's a big new model out there.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Michael Kennedy>So I want to give a shout out to Claude Sonnet 4.5.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.680
<v Michael Kennedy>I think this is worth checking out.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Michael Kennedy>If you're using something that lets you choose a model, there are many of them now, as we'll see.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Choosing Sonnet 4.5 is quite good.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.580
<v Michael Kennedy>So have you been playing with this yet?

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.340
<v Michael Kennedy>It only came out like a couple of days ago, or maybe a week ago.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.860
<v Michael Kennedy>It came out basically the day we recorded last.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.500
<v Brian Okken>I have not had a chance to play with it.

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:11.860
<v Michael Kennedy>So faster than the older Clods, a little bit better.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I say it's even better than the Opus one, which was like setting money on fire if you tried to use that thing.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.020
<v Michael Kennedy>It was like 100 times more expensive or something.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Michael Kennedy>It was out of control.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.060
<v Michael Kennedy>So let's see.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I took a few notes of some of the things that I thought were kind of noteworthy of it.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.780
<v Michael Kennedy>So apparently it ranks as the top programming model, which is pretty cool.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.280
<v Michael Kennedy>And we live in such weird times.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:43.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Our programming tool has reduced concerning behaviors like sycophancy, deception, power seeking, and a tendency to encourage delusional thinking.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Hey, I guess it's good if your programming tool doesn't do that.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Isn't that right?

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.379
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, would you want your programming tool to be sycophant?

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:52.480
<v Michael Kennedy>No.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Come on, not really.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.940
<v Michael Kennedy>A little sycophancy is good, but not too much.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.960
<v Brian Okken>Michael, if you don't want it to be, then that's a good thing.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.020
<v Michael Kennedy>That's right.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Michael Kennedy>You're absolutely right.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:03.160
<v Michael Kennedy>No.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I didn't think of that.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:06.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Good job.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Gosh, I was confused.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Michael Kennedy>I've been a bad bot.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Michael Kennedy>They've also, as part of this, released the Cloud Agent SDK, which is what they use to build Claude Code.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:25.700
<v Michael Kennedy>So that's pretty cool if you want to bring that into your own platform and do it.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:36.740
<v Michael Kennedy>And speaking of which, JetBrains, their AI platform, now allows you to use Cloud Sonic 4.5 as well, built right into PyCharm.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Michael Kennedy>That's pretty sweet.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:46.980
<v Michael Kennedy>And of course, Klein.bot supports it, because that one lets you just put in your key, and you get your thing.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Michael Kennedy>That plugs into both PyCharm and VS Code and Cursor and all the things.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.580
<v Michael Kennedy>On Cursor, you can pick it.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.000
<v Michael Kennedy>And Claude Code, obviously, you can pick it, because it's from them.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Here you can even see at the top, new Cloud Sonic 4.5 is live in Klein.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.680
<v Michael Kennedy>So anyway, I encourage people to check it out.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I've been doing some significant work with it.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Michael Kennedy>I actually did two PRs to Python by Set.fm.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.740
<v Michael Kennedy>One is like 4,300 lines.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.800
<v Michael Kennedy>And one is 3,000 lines just in the last day.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Michael Kennedy>And they came out incredibly.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.400
<v Michael Kennedy>I haven't had time to show you, Brian.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.280
<v Brian Okken>But after this, I can show you and see what you think.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.060
<v Brian Okken>It's pretty neat.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.480
<v Brian Okken>Did the first one change all the quotes to double quotes?

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.740
<v Brian Okken>And the second one changed all the double quotes to single quotes?

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.740
<v Michael Kennedy>That's a good question.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:34.720
<v Michael Kennedy>No, actually, I have a bunch of rules that tell it it has to run ruff format and rough check before and after it does everything.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.240
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's always sort of staying in sync with the way that I want.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.740
<v Michael Kennedy>It won't cycle back and forth like that.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.620
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I'm curious about, what was it, the Hacktober?

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, yeah, that's going to be different, isn't it?

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.140
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, with all the AI tools.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Although, to be fair, I don't know if it's going to be better or worse because I know some of those Hacktober fests, I would get the dumbest things like, oh, if you submit a PR to an open source project, guess what? You get a star. And I would get this like, I'm correcting this bit of grammar in your readme. I'm not even sure that's the correct grammar. And no, I'm not taking a PR that you put like a semicolon or instead of a colon here because you want a Hacktoberfest thing.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:20.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Get away from me, people.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.040
<v Brian Okken>And I kind of am jealous about some of the popularity of projects.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.040
<v Brian Okken>A lot of the projects I work on are not that popular, which is fine.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.660
<v Brian Okken>But also, in October, I'm not that upset about it.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.360
<v Brian Okken>Because I just heard from, for example, David Lord already said that he's gotten a bunch of stuff.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.880
<v Brian Okken>I bet he has.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:41.980
<v Brian Okken>A bunch of stuff.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:44.360
<v Brian Okken>Anyway.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Before we move on from this, follow up on the 3.14 thing from Jared.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm really looking forward to Python 3.14's REPL letting you tab complete import statements.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.480
<v Brian Okken>Oh my gosh, please.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.140
<v Brian Okken>I didn't notice that.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:56.840
<v Brian Okken>That's great.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.360
<v Brian Okken>Let it happen.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:07.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm so tired of like, I hit up arrow and it like goes line by line through a loop or there's no autocomplete or I'll type part of a thing and come back and it's like, no, you didn't type anything.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.820
<v Michael Kennedy>We're just going to cycle through what you did.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, no.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.200
<v Michael Kennedy>So all those improvements are very welcome.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.060
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:13.940
<v Brian Okken>Indeed.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:14.900
<v Brian Okken>Cool.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:24.180
<v Brian Okken>Well, as grateful as I am for Python 3.14, I'm looking forward to 3.15.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Brian, don't be lazy.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Work with the stuff that you got.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:28.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Come on.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.080
<v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:36.580
<v Brian Okken>Well, in Python 3.15, one of the things that's coming is explicit lazy imports.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.100
<v Brian Okken>And, boy, this is an inside baseball kind of thing.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.900
<v Brian Okken>But that's what this podcast is all about, isn't it?

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.200
<v Brian Okken>I'm here for it.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Michael Kennedy>I am so here for this idea.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Brian Okken>I am too.

00:23:50.419 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Brian Okken>PEP 810, explicit lazy imports.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.580
<v Brian Okken>So the idea is actually, it's just common.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.560
<v Brian Okken>We put imports at the top of the file, right?

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:06.540
<v Brian Okken>But if you do that, then everything that imports it imports all your imports also.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.980
<v Brian Okken>And you don't actually have to do that.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.020
<v Brian Okken>You can put, anyway, we'll get back to that.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:18.580
<v Brian Okken>You can put them in a function or something and they'll get imported for the entire module the first time they're used.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.420
<v Brian Okken>That's the way we do lazy imports now.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.980
<v Brian Okken>In the future, it'll do that automatically if you just throw a lazy in front of it.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Brian Okken>So it'll work with lazy import.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:42.040
<v Brian Okken>You can say lazy import JSON and JSON won't get imported until the first time or you can do lazy import JSON from or lazy from JSON import dumps or something.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.760
<v Brian Okken>You can do the from thing as well.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.460
<v Brian Okken>So either way, it won't load it until it's needed.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.600
<v Brian Okken>And this is a minor little syntax thing that's going to save a lot.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.520
<v Brian Okken>I love this.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.180
<v Michael Kennedy>So do you have any thoughts on this?

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.860
<v Michael Kennedy>I am here for it.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:08.140
<v Michael Kennedy>So it drives me crazy that just because I want to allow my code to use a library, it has to process all of that all the time.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:16.440
<v Michael Kennedy>And if there's some kind of weird edge case, like it depends upon some configuration, but the configuration environment variable is not set.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.620
<v Michael Kennedy>It'll crash during import.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Like there's all these weird cases.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And I talked a little while ago about, I think I said Michael learns a lesson, right?

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:32.540
<v Michael Kennedy>I had something that was a little utility built inside of Talk Python's code base or the course's code base or whatever.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:34.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And I'm like, oh, I'll just reuse these few little utility things.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:42.220
<v Michael Kennedy>And because of that, just the import statements to load up all of that code made it take several seconds to start.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.480
<v Michael Kennedy>put it in its own file and copied a few utilities over, and it took like 100 mil.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.400
<v Michael Kennedy>It was like 10 times faster.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.300
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's exactly because of this.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Michael Kennedy>It didn't use any of that stuff or hardly any of that stuff.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:26:00.000
<v Michael Kennedy>It just pulled it in because it's got to get the library from a sub package, so off it goes.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.520
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.640
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, where I get hit a lot is, and actually we have a side.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.620
<v Brian Okken>Maybe I jumped the gun on this from Hugo.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.080
<v Brian Okken>Lazy Imports, I forgot.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.280
<v Brian Okken>This is a draft.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.200
<v Brian Okken>And it's not approved yet.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.680
<v Brian Okken>It's a draft.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.380
<v Brian Okken>So maybe it comes in at 3.15.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.840
<v Brian Okken>Brian, if you right-click and say Inspect Element,

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.940
<v Michael Kennedy>and then you can just edit the status, it'll be fine.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:23.940
<v Brian Okken>It's a wiki, right?

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:24.740
<v Brian Okken>I can just change it?

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.020
<v Brian Okken>Just for you.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.180
<v Brian Okken>So PEP 810 is still in draft and under discussion.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Brian Okken>It's not submitted to the Steering Council yet.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.220
<v Brian Okken>So thanks, Hugo.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.960
<v Brian Okken>But I guess there's my vote.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.820
<v Brian Okken>I hope it gets in.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.040
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:37.620
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.100
<v Brian Okken>And I hope this is in as well.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:40.840
<v Brian Okken>Thanks, Hugo.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:27:08.820
<v Brian Okken>um one of the but uh another another article i should probably write is how to do this with testing because um i i do this with testing a lot i'll throw it's common to have a test module that like has to import quite a few things to test things or report things or draw a graph or what all sorts of stuff you can do um but if what py test does is it it imports all of your test code before it starts running.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:16.700
<v Brian Okken>And even if you want to, so if you're going to just run one test file, like one test within your file, it'll do all the imports.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.980
<v Brian Okken>So it is nice to like separate your heavy imports.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:28.720
<v Brian Okken>And there's ways to measure to figure out which ones your heavy imports are and move those into a lazy method or lazy import.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.720
<v Brian Okken>But anyway, hopefully it'll come in.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.780
<v Michael Kennedy>I hope so too.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm here for this idea.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:42.940
<v Michael Kennedy>By the way, I'll also see you, Dino Veland, and Brittany Reynoso and some of the folks from the Cinder team at Meta.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think some of these ideas originally came out from Cinder, I don't know 100% for sure, but that'd be pretty cool to see some of that work coming over, right?

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.800
<v Michael Kennedy>That's where Free Threaded Python came from as well.

00:27:56.019 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, all right.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.620
<v Michael Kennedy>- Right, from Sam Gross.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome, okay.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.460
<v Michael Kennedy>That's it for all of our stuff.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.120
<v Michael Kennedy>How extra are you feeling?

00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:05.660
<v Brian Okken>- Are we done?

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:06.620
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm done.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:07.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.400
<v Brian Okken>I have extras, though.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:11.680
<v Brian Okken>Why don't you go first, though?

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.160
<v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:18.440
<v Brian Okken>This was sent in to us from Patrick of the band Friends in Real Life.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.800
<v Brian Okken>He just said that, and I don't know how to do the fancy thing where you'll have to listen to the song.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.120
<v Brian Okken>They made a music video.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:29.620
<v Brian Okken>I'll just play it.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:30.780
<v Brian Okken>They made a music video.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.580
<v Brian Okken>It prints out.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.380
<v Brian Okken>While the music's going on, prints, all the stuff.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.580
<v Brian Okken>And it's really fun.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.040
<v Brian Okken>Near the end, it starts going fast.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.140
<v Brian Okken>And I love the end.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.700
<v Brian Okken>I'm just going to fast forward to the end part because it's like super fun.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.940
<v Brian Okken>It just starts taking off.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.000
<v Brian Okken>We'll click ahead.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.140
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, just starts flying.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.040
<v Brian Okken>It's so fun.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.740
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, he said he wrote it with Python.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.120
<v Brian Okken>And there's the code that he wrote.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.020
<v Brian Okken>And there's even test code, which is kind of cool.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.300
<v Brian Okken>And it'd be fun to do it.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.080
<v Brian Okken>I'll do a PR against something that's already done.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.340
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, it's just a fun extra thing, right?

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.800
<v Brian Okken>Making a music video with Python.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.480
<v Brian Okken>Love it.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and it's built with a rich and stuff.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.120
<v Michael Kennedy>It's a good song.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.760
<v Michael Kennedy>I enjoy it.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.660
<v Michael Kennedy>It's got a little movable typography, kinematic text or whatever.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.300
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, it's very fun.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.920
<v Brian Okken>The other thing I wanted to do, just a short one.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.340
<v Brian Okken>I was trying to write this article about testing.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.160
<v Brian Okken>Testing is 3.14.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:48.400
<v Brian Okken>And I went through a project and I realized that I needed to change one of my, I needed to get a new token from test PyPI.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:56.040
<v Brian Okken>My pypi.org is fine, but the test one, it like has different credentials.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.200
<v Brian Okken>You have to log into it too.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.520
<v Brian Okken>And I like lost my primary email login.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.720
<v Brian Okken>So, yeah.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.260
<v Brian Okken>I'll have to fix that.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, boy.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:13.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it kind of does bug me that there's different logins and stuff.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.200
<v Brian Okken>I like that it's a separate one, but I don't get why it's a different login.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.720
<v Brian Okken>It should just be the same credentials, I think.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, exactly.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.260
<v Brian Okken>There's probably a good reason for it.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:24.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:25.800
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Your extras, please, sir.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes, indeed.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Michael Kennedy>My extras are coming.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:38.920
<v Michael Kennedy>So, I don't know, did I tell you about how frustrated I got with my old blog?

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:48.540
<v Michael Kennedy>So, I had this blog over at WordPress.com, and I'd had it since 2006, and I'd written about 160 articles.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:31:00.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Many of them are kind of like, yeah, they're not really in stuff that I care that much about anymore, but, I mean, that's 10 years of writing or, no, 15 years of writing before I moved to my newer website.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.440
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't really want to throw that away.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:56.540
<v Michael Kennedy>but to have your own domain you have to pay WordPress.com and I'm just like you know what I it's on my own domain I have to leave it there if I take it off that's even worse but every year I was paying $48 remember the joke we had it was like a person sweating over which of the two buttons to press and one said pay $12. The other one said, admit the dream is over. It's kind of like that. It's like, I'm never going to write again for this, but I don't want it to go away. So I'm like, well, what am I going to do? So I actually, I'd been thinking about this for a year or two, and I tried to like download it with web scraping and just the way that WordPress works. And just, it was always like really messed up. So it occurred to me, I'm sitting there like, I bet you that Claude, Sonnet 4.0 by the way at the time, I bet Claude could get it.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.280
<v Michael Kennedy>So I just tell it, hey Claude, here's a WordPress website.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:05.760
<v Michael Kennedy>I want to take all of this and convert it to Markdown in Hugo format and then put it into my Hugo website.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.180
<v Michael Kennedy>And I just turned it loose on it.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.380
<v Michael Kennedy>And it said, great, looks like the RSS feed is what we want.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Pulled down the RSS feed, generated me a bunch of posts.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:15.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, that's really cool.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:25.940
<v Michael Kennedy>So then I got it to give me the regular expression I put into Nginx so that I could completely keep all of my SEO.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:36.520
<v Michael Kennedy>So if there's somebody that's got a link to a blog post 15 years ago and they click it, it'll still 301 permanent redirect exactly to my Hugo site.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:46.140
<v Michael Kennedy>And I did a little slash R for archived for all the posts that are, so I can look at the URL and go, oh, that's an old imported one, or no, that's one that I wrote from scratch in Hugo.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.220
<v Michael Kennedy>And I'm like, yeah, that's it, we're done.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.500
<v Michael Kennedy>That took like an hour.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.880
<v Michael Kennedy>And then I realized WordPress is just amazing.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.260
<v Michael Kennedy>It like only returns 50 articles out of the 160.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Crap, so back, all right, now your job is to go parse it.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:12.940
<v Michael Kennedy>And so basically I wrote up this article called Goodbye WordPress, Thanks AI, where I talked about how I got it to just go and parse all that.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.320
<v Michael Kennedy>And now all the articles are there.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Michael Kennedy>You can go find the posts.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:24.460
<v Michael Kennedy>If you go to all the posts and you just hold it down, you're back into some seriously old stuff.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Michael Kennedy>But if I go back a little bit of ways, right?

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:35.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, let me see something like here, add hotkeys to your website, wrote in 2012.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.020
<v Michael Kennedy>I still use that today, by the way.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:43.420
<v Michael Kennedy>It even has chords like KGI, goes like go to inbox sort of thing.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.560
<v Michael Kennedy>I've got to pick up an icon there.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:54.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And it even downloaded most of the images and other content.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.740
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know if I got any here, but I'm clicking around.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:13.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, I just want to encourage people, like if you're feeling stuck or you've got some project, you're like, "Man, that would take me weeks." And yeah, $48 a year sucks, but a week's worth of my work sucks more, so I'm just going to bite the bullet and pay it.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.240
<v Michael Kennedy>go to one of these Agenda AI's and give it a good description and see what it'll do.

00:34:17.419 --> 00:34:20.639
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe you can just escape. Anyway, goodbye WordPress. Thanks AI.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:29.080
<v Brian Okken>So what you're saying is you went back in time and had AI write your blog from 10 years ago?

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:43.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes, actually, in a sense, I sort of did. I had it write the markdown version. So now everything has front matter and it's all markdown and all that kind of stuff. So anyway, that was a really cool experience. And it's been like years, it's been bothering me, but I'm just like, nope, it's Not worth a week?

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.100
<v Michael Kennedy>No, Michael, no.

00:34:46.619 --> 00:34:50.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Whatever you think this is worth, just pay the $48 and move on, right?

00:34:50.899 --> 00:34:58.180
<v Michael Kennedy>But it was like a warm summer night a few weeks ago and just sitting down like, I'm gonna just turn the AI loose on and see if you can get, and it did incredibly well.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, so encouragement there.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.540
<v Michael Kennedy>I did a big release on my content types library.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I talked about this a while ago.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:19.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I talked about content types And the idea is you can give it a file or a URL or an extension, and it will tell you things like, oh, that's an MP3.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:29.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And, well, for the MP3, well, what kind of mime type or content type do I put into, like, a web response, right?

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.540
<v Michael Kennedy>It's super easy if it's just JPEG, right?

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Image JPEG.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, is there the E in there?

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Is it JPEG or is it JPEG?

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Ah, man, I don't remember.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.740
<v Michael Kennedy>But it gets more complicated.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.560
<v Michael Kennedy>What if it's a Parquet data science file?

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:47.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, that's application.vnds.apache.parquet.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Or like, oh my goodness.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.480
<v Michael Kennedy>So I had this before, and it had like 200 types or whatever.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Now it has 360, and I put way more in there.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:03.220
<v Michael Kennedy>So the release notes say all the different types that it added, 137 new types across different categories and so on.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.720
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you're parsing files and going, I need a content type, or given an extension, what is it?

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Or given a content type, what extension is that?

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.300
<v Michael Kennedy>all those kind of things.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:12.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Here you go.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:13.860
<v Michael Kennedy>- Cool.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.280
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yes, I know there's something built into Python in the standard library.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not the same thing.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:20.460
<v Michael Kennedy>This is better.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:29.740
<v Michael Kennedy>The one built into Python varies by machine of what responses it gives you, which is just weird 'cause it doesn't actually have its own data.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.380
<v Michael Kennedy>It looks into the OS registry for what your current OS thinks a MIME type of a thing is.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:35.860
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.480
<v Michael Kennedy>There's other ones that require access to files.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So anyway, there's I talked about it before, but lots of updates to that.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Here's one of my PRs, Brian.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.360
<v Michael Kennedy>I thought I wanted to look for something and I can't remember what it was.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, yes, I can remember what it was.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.960
<v Michael Kennedy>There's this project called Dev Docs.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And I talked to Hugo Bowen Anderson about this on the podcast.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.920
<v Michael Kennedy>And I'm like, there's this app, I don't remember what it is.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.600
<v Michael Kennedy>And then I'm like, let me search around.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.460
<v Michael Kennedy>I was searching and I went to search on Python bytes.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.840
<v Michael Kennedy>So I did a major improvement on the search engine here.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:15.040
<v Michael Kennedy>This is a part of one of those big PRs.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:28.020
<v Michael Kennedy>And for example, if I search for pytest, it would just say episode name, episode name, episode name, episode name, and there's 330 episodes out of 450 or whatever.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.060
<v Michael Kennedy>It's almost every episode is that.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:38.660
<v Michael Kennedy>You're like, God, but there was a thing that was actually, like where the topic was pytest, not where the word pytest was used.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Because we search all the spoken text, right?

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Michael Kennedy>So now we have a little button we can press, like a toggle, like an iOS toggle, that shows you only show me the stuff where it actually appears.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:57.340
<v Michael Kennedy>And notice every episode now has the core topics, your topic, my topic, listed out separately.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.620
<v Brian Okken>This is awesome.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:00.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Thank you.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.000
<v Michael Kennedy>The search word that appears is highlighted in yellow.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Now watch this.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:05.940
<v Michael Kennedy>So see this Python language summit?

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:12.340
<v Michael Kennedy>If I click that, it jumps over and highlights that part of the show notes for that part of the content.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.700
<v Brian Okken>So cool.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.020
<v Michael Kennedy>How epic is this?

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.340
<v Michael Kennedy>So what I was looking for was dev docs.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:20.800
<v Michael Kennedy>There it is.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:23.760
<v Michael Kennedy>You can see now really quickly, you don't have to go through all the episodes.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:33.460
<v Michael Kennedy>You can see, boom, it's the second one from 276, and it's the second topic covered, and it points that out right there, and I can jump right to it.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.720
<v Brian Okken>That's very cool.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:38.540
<v Michael Kennedy>So that's one of my extras.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Guys, please use the search.

00:38:41.539 --> 00:38:44.340
<v Michael Kennedy>If you're looking for something, I put a ton of effort in the search engine.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.020
<v Michael Kennedy>It's really fast.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.580
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not perfect, but it's pretty darn good.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.160
<v Michael Kennedy>It's better than most sites search.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:49.820
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll tell you that.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:51.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:38:52.799 --> 00:39:00.500
<v Brian Okken>Well, I really like that it pops out the topics because sometimes I'm like, we talked about it, but it wasn't a topic.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.520
<v Brian Okken>So I am going to have to look more.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Brian Okken>But there's also the ones where it was a topic, and I'm pretty sure it was listed.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:15.140
<v Brian Okken>Just having the name that it showed up at some point we talked about, it isn't enough.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.180
<v Brian Okken>But having this is great.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:17.920
<v Brian Okken>I love it.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:18.140
<v Brian Okken>Awesome.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:18.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Thank you.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:19.960
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:21.780
<v Michael Kennedy>One more thing.

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:26.120
<v Michael Kennedy>My book is officially, officially out and available for purchase.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:27.680
<v Brian Okken>Very cool.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Thank you.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:34.180
<v Michael Kennedy>232 pages available on Amazon.com and on Gumroad, whichever you pick.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.740
<v Brian Okken>You said your book, but what is the book name?

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:42.740
<v Michael Kennedy>The book is Talk Python in Production, A Cloud Agnostic Guide to Building, Scaling, and Managing Your Own Python Infrastructure.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:49.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, right now it's only on an e-book, but I'm working on a paperback as well.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.340
<v Michael Kennedy>And how is it doing?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.680
<v Michael Kennedy>It is number one in application development and number two in software engineering.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.460
<v Michael Kennedy>That's pretty epic.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:57.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Wow.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:58.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.560
<v Michael Kennedy>and i have not really even promoted i've even sent an email for people who said they were interested

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:08.520
<v Brian Okken>in stuff like that so oh you should totally uh plug it on the podcast yeah i've i've talked about

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:27.360
<v Michael Kennedy>and talked by then this is the first time i talked about it here um i do want to just say it got posted on hacker news and got really popular there and the first question was how much of this book is written with ai i bet all of it zero of it zero this book is written with ai I put a ton of work into it.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.220
<v Michael Kennedy>It took me nine months.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.360
<v Michael Kennedy>It may or may not be amazing, but at least it's human, right?

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.820
<v Michael Kennedy>So there you go.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, that's all out, and people can check it out.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.260
<v Brian Okken>Books are a weird thing, right?

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:45.460
<v Brian Okken>I still love books, yet it takes forever to write a book.

00:40:46.579 --> 00:40:48.340
<v Brian Okken>And maybe other people are really bad.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.560
<v Brian Okken>I mean, nine months is not bad.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.980
<v Brian Okken>I spent a year and a half on both editions of mine so far.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.840
<v Brian Okken>I would not spend a year and a half again.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.040
<v Brian Okken>And then you sell it for like $20.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.260
<v Brian Okken>It's a lot of value for $20.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:02.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I think so.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:03.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, $19.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.200
<v Michael Kennedy>You can get it on Amazon or you can get it on Gumroad.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.840
<v Michael Kennedy>They're both DRM-free.

00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:13.160
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you don't care, I don't know what to – it's so weird.

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:20.660
<v Michael Kennedy>I get three times more money for the same amount that you all pay if you get it on Gumroad.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.160
<v Michael Kennedy>But if you guys bought it on Amazon, it boosts the rankings, which may help it.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.600
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know what to tell people to do.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Get it wherever you want. It's DRM free. Enjoy it.

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:31.920
<v Michael Kennedy>That's it for all my extras.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.920
<v Michael Kennedy>I think we're done then.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:36.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, we need something funny.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.320
<v Michael Kennedy>We do need something funny.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.320
<v Michael Kennedy>I think this is a little bit in the testing space, so it might resonate with you, Brian.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not exactly in the testing space, but it's pretty darn close.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Here's the estimation.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.400
<v Michael Kennedy>How long will it take you to do this project?

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.120
<v Michael Kennedy>So there's different views here.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.560
<v Michael Kennedy>The noob says, that'll take a day.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:09.080
<v Michael Kennedy>The junior, I estimate it'll take three days because she knows that the noob tried it for one day, and that was before they asked for the docs and the error handling.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.160
<v Michael Kennedy>That was the happy case in one day.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.780
<v Michael Kennedy>But you're not done in one day.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.620
<v Michael Kennedy>No, the senior dev says, that's an M-sized story.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.480
<v Michael Kennedy>It just makes me squirm a little bit hearing that.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Are you ready how the principal...

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.280
<v Brian Okken>Oh, T-shirt sizes, right.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.700
<v Michael Kennedy>The t-shirt size is extra small, small, medium.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:33.020
<v Michael Kennedy>But you ready for the pro, the principal engineer, the senior engineer one?

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.680
<v Brian Okken>You guys give estimates?

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:35.720
<v Michael Kennedy>What is this?

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.240
<v Brian Okken>There's a laughing mouse.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.560
<v Brian Okken>JC in the comment says,

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.260
<v Michael Kennedy>if you're doing sprint planning and t-shirt sizes, you're going to be miserable at your company.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:52.880
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:56.680
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm not even sure if there's anything good in here or relevant, but I think that's it for the comments.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.760
<v Michael Kennedy>But I thought it was funny.

00:42:58.939 --> 00:43:02.580
<v Brian Okken>So you're a solopreneur, sort of, right?

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes, yeah, pretty much.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:07.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, I have people help with stuff, but pretty much, let's go with yes.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you do sprint estimates?

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:14.320
<v Michael Kennedy>What a good question.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.920
<v Michael Kennedy>No, not really.

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:20.880
<v Michael Kennedy>I just kind of like maybe small or huge.

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.280
<v Michael Kennedy>is that going to be something I can just do soon?

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Or is that like a really long project that's not worth doing?

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.260
<v Michael Kennedy>That's the only estimate I do.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.500
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like I really don't do sprint estimates.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:35.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I have started keeping a changelog for myself though on stuff.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:36.680
<v Brian Okken>That's good.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:46.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and like sort of doing a release every week or two on certain projects so that I can go and if I go to Git, I can just look at the history of the changelog.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, yeah, that was in this like timeframe or whatever.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.260
<v Michael Kennedy>That's been kind of helpful.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.180
<v Michael Kennedy>So that's the closest I got to formalities.

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:56.840
<v Michael Kennedy>I have a release log for stuff that nobody sees.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.160
<v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.820
<v Brian Okken>I've gone to Kanban.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.600
<v Brian Okken>I'm on a weird project, but stuff.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.280
<v Brian Okken>But I've been doing Kanban board where there's like a big backlog.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.280
<v Brian Okken>And then I try to have like only two to three things in the up next queue.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.900
<v Brian Okken>And then just hit it like that.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.360
<v Michael Kennedy>That's a good idea.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:20.360
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I like that a lot.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:25.840
<v Brian Okken>And then I can look at the list of done things and when they got done and stuff.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:39.280
<v Brian Okken>But when I get pressed on estimates, I push back because I'm mostly working on stuff that it's hard to estimate.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.760
<v Brian Okken>And it's like, well, you need to practice, then you'll get better at it.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.140
<v Brian Okken>But for what?

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.800
<v Brian Okken>I could spend time to estimate, but I think I'd rather spend time actually getting stuff done.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:45:03.620
<v Brian Okken>and then when I do estimate I'll be like yeah it'll take like a month and and I get back well that's too long okay well what answer do you want exactly I I do think there's an interesting

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:32.440
<v Michael Kennedy>analogy to like architecture like I can get a really accurate plan and how long it takes to build this bridge and it's only within 20 margin of error or whatever but bridges that bridge has been built over and over and over across different roads and streams and stuff the reason you build software is because it hasn't been built before if it just existed as a package you would just use it if it exists as a product you'd probably just use it like most of the time you're trying you're like inventing a little bit of what you're doing yeah and so it's like

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:45.620
<v Brian Okken>yeah and it might be a long estimate like yeah there might be some people that do like a lot of stuff that they've kind of done before but i've followed a career path where i'm trying to do things that I haven't done before.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.360
<v Brian Okken>And I'm probably the best person to accomplish that.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.160
<v Brian Okken>So there's not a lot of pushback.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.320
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, yeah. The one thing I would add is

00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:00.360
<v Michael Kennedy>if you do have to do estimates, do them holistically and include cleaning up tech debt.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:06.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Include writing the tests that you need to write. Include making the code look good.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.400
<v Michael Kennedy>It's tempting to go, well, when could I get the first thing working?

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.900
<v Brian Okken>That's probably three days.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.420
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, tell them it takes five.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.540
<v Michael Kennedy>If it's three days, tell them it's five.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Michael Kennedy>So you get that time to do the cleanup and you don't accumulate a worse and worse product over time.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, and also the I can come back and clean it up.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.680
<v Brian Okken>You will get that time will fill up and you won't be able to do that.

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:29.380
<v Brian Okken>So, yeah.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, our time is up, Brian.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:36.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:38.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Our time is up.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.180
