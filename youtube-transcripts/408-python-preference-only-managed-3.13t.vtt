WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.220
Hey, Brian.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.400
How are we doing?

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.500
I'm great.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.900
Ready to kick off this week's show?

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.620
Yeah.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.380
Yeah, let's do it.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.040
All right.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.760
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.340
where we deliver Python news and headlines

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.180
directly to your earbuds.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.180
This is episode 408,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.380
recorded Monday, November 4th, 2024.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.320
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.420
And I'm Brian Arkin.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.440
And this episode is brought to you

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.200
by Scout APM.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.000
You can get Python and Django

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.300
application performance monitoring

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.020
and Codeium, a free AI code completion

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.860
and chat tool.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.720
That's pretty awesome.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.540
So be sure to check them out.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.580
We'll tell you more about both of them later.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.400
Links are in the show notes.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.440
You can connect with us on the socials.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.920
Best place probably is Fostadon or Mastodon.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.960
Sometimes people confuse us like,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.100
oh, you have to be on Fostadon.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.440
No, anywhere in Mastodon,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.280
anywhere on that social network,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.900
it's totally fine.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.700
Doesn't matter where you are.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.580
we'd be happy to chat with you there.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.800
You can sometimes find us on X,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.840
sometimes on LinkedIn,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.000
but, you know,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.940
Mastodon maybe.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.440
Watch the show live at pythonbytes.fm

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.300
slash live.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.160
Be part of the audience.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.860
Usually, Brian,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.380
usually at 10 a.m. on Mondays Pacific time,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.540
but not today.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.120
A little earlier.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.420
And finally,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.960
if you want a artisanal handcrafted digest

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.600
of everything that we talked about

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.080
written by hand for you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.420
by Brian Okken,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.440
just join our newsletter list.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.720
Go to Python by Side of M.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.160
click on newsletter.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.340
We won't share your stuff.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.340
Just for us to talk with you.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.180
And,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.820
with that,

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.080
Brian,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.060
I believe

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.120
we are ready to kick it off.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.840
It's both earlier

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.440
and slightly less early

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.180
than you expected.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.080
Yes.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.520
Right?

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.440
It's 7.30

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.660
for our time in the morning.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.200
But actually,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.400
is that 8.30?

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.260
I don't know.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.520
Like,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.040
time is weird.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.540
It's been warped.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.000
Yeah.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.300
Time's on hold right now

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.220
until the end of tomorrow.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.120
But we'll see.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.660
No,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.460
but time change.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.280
But we're not going to talk

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.900
about time change.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.080
We're going to talk about

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.580
GitHub Action Security.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.180
So,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.800
I ran across,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.560
let's pop this up.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.560
I ran across

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.640
Ned Batchelder's

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.800
GitHub Action Security

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.940
Zizmor.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.420
Z-I-Z-M-O-R.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.140
So,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.620
it's not Ned's tool,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.920
but he came across it.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.120
So,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.380
we'll talk a little bit

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.920
about what it does.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.100
So,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.560
it is,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.900
I'm going to pop over.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.860
It is,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.040
Zizmor is,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.320
it says it's

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.060
a tool for finding

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.220
security issues

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.860
with GitHub

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.240
Action Setups.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.320
So,

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.480
what are we talking about here?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.580
Really,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.620
there's,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.880
Action Workflows

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.540
are something

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.780
that I don't

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.540
actually look at

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.060
very often.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.640
I update

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.280
when I think

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.840
I need to,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.920
but I haven't done

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.740
a security audit

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.180
of them.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.400
So,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400
I think it's a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.960
decent idea

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.720
to think about that.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.640
And,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.000
and this article

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.540
from Ned

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.280
says he,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.480
he went through

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.520
a lot of,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.720
a lot of projects

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.640
and did find

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.280
some issues.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.380
so,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.500
so,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.500
so,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.500
so,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.780
I think he said

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.020
he found

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.560
some issues.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.180
But he has,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.960
he has a,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.380
I mean,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.900
Ned supports

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.000
a lot of projects.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.380
So,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.240
there was a bit

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.600
of work.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.120
So,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.560
in his,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.160
in his article,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.160
he also includes

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.460
a script

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.000
that he wrote

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.760
to go through

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.440
all of his

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.360
repositories

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.240
and to,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.780
to audits

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.140
on them

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.600
for their

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.080
workflows.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.760
So,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.260
what do you do?

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.460
So,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.700
this,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.180
this is more

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.900
tool.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.420
It's,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.880
it's not a pip install.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.620
It is,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.940
it is something

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.140
you can do cargo install

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.780
or brew install,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.300
I think.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.540
Yeah,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.360
or you can get it

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.960
from source,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.340
but,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.280
but hopefully

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.840
one of those

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.680
will work for you

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.200
to,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.980
to install it.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.500
And then,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.320
and then you just

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.460
point it at your

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.920
YAML,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.500
your workflow

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.240
YAML files

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.760
and it does

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.420
an evaluation.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.200
And then it does,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.940
it,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.500
it's looking,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.980
it's,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.340
this is still

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.140
sort of in,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.560
I think they

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.720
said that it was

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.540
in alpha

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.860
or,

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.840
it says it's beta.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.300
So,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.580
it's in beta,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.400
they're still working

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.760
on it,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.660
but there's,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.100
there's some things

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.800
that they're looking

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.120
for,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.560
like,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.900
like abandoned

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.960
projects and

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.900
things like that.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.220
So,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.580
I think this is a

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.320
kind of a cool thing.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.960
I don't really pay

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.700
too much attention

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.060
to,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.500
I sort of,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.820
I have to admit,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.700
I copy,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.960
I find another

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.440
project,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.400
a Python project

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.000
that's doing

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.680
something similar

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.460
that I want to do

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.400
and I kind of copy

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.960
what they're doing

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.420
in their,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.860
their GitHub action

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.280
workflow.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.760
So,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.700
like something like

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.360
this is pretty good.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.440
There is an audit

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.080
rules page

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.780
so you can see

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.860
what kind of things

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.860
it's looking for.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.260
and there's not much

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.660
here yet

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.260
but I think

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.780
they'll add more.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.200
So,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.020
anyway,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.860
that's a new tool.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.880
Yeah,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.340
looks great.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.000
Looks very good.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.960
I think we want

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.700
to stick with GitHub

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.480
here.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.940
So,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.000
I want to tell you

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.440
about some

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.760
pretty exciting news

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.920
but also

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.060
not just exciting news,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.740
a pretty

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.240
powerful look

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.820
into the open

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.460
source world.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.100
So,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.480
the headline here,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.900
I ran across this

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.960
and got a few

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.240
plus ones

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.860
from listeners

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.880
including Pat Decker.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.100
So,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.680
thank you Pat

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.680
for sending this in.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.140
This is the Octoverse

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.480
report,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.380
aka GitHub.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.320
AI leads Python

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.200
to the top

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.960
language

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.060
as the number

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.580
of global

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.880
developers surge.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.920
So,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.620
we previously

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.720
said Python

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.120
is the number

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.660
one language

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.700
according to

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.300
Stack Overflow

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.880
questions,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.560
right?

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.460
This is,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.300
Python is the number

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.540
of,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.340
this is the number

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.860
one language

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.520
as of

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.840
usage

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.780
on

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.560
GitHub

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.660
which is

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.120
I'd say

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.980
more meaningful

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:46.360
maybe.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.140
I,

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.080
I don't know,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.560
what does it mean

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.340
to be

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.080
number one

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.060
of a language?

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.080
Is that lines of code?

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.580
Is that numbers

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.440
of repositories?

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.980
Is that numbers

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.440
of users?

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.280
There's many metrics

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.000
that could be used,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.240
right?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.820
Yeah,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.280
I don't know.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.120
Yeah,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.380
I don't know.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.880
This article is,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.600
you know,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.580
when I first saw it

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.800
I thought,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.940
oh,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.420
this would just be

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.140
like a little headline

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.460
or something.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.040
This is a 25 minute

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.220
read according to

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.100
Pocket.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.800
So,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.960
this is a serious

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.900
beast.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.400
And so,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.860
I want to jump

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.420
over to Pocket

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.420
and why am I

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.860
using Pocket

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.520
in an omnivore?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.960
Well,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.000
hang in for the

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.100
extras at the end.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.960
So,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.640
let's see

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.400
a couple of things

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.540
here.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.820
So,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.820
first of all,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.460
this is for GitHub.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.700
We have 518 million

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.720
total projects

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.600
on GitHub.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.580
Wow.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.840
With 25%

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.880
year over year growth,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.440
that's pretty crazy.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.460
Over a billion

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.400
contributions

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.040
to public

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.820
and open source

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.000
projects.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.440
That's not

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.000
private ones.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.520
I think something

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.460
like 75%

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.760
or 80%

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.360
of contributions

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.960
are to private

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.340
repos.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.420
But of the

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.840
public and

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.200
open source

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.480
ones,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.140
that's a lot.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.860
That's a lot.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.340
And,

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.240
Python overtakes

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.900
JavaScript as the

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.400
number one language,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.420
which is pretty

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.940
interesting.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.160
So,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.060
highlighted a couple

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.540
things here

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.260
because there's

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.780
just too much

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.200
here for me

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.920
to keep

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.400
in my head.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.960
A rapidly

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.840
growing number

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.460
of developers

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.940
worldwide,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.500
especially in

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.780
Africa,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.320
Latin America,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.800
and Asia.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.220
This suggests

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.600
AI isn't just

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.300
helping more people

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.320
learn to write code

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.980
or build software

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.480
faster.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.180
It's also attracting

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.880
and helping more

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.540
people become

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.140
developers.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.640
First-time open

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.320
source contributions

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.480
continue to show

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.520
wide-scale interest

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.380
in AI projects.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.280
Importantly,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.540
we aren't seeing

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.880
signs that AI

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.040
has hurt open source

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.960
with low-quality

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.520
contributions.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.800
Again,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.420
what metric,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.620
but interesting,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.820
right?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.260
That is interesting,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.640
yeah.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.780
And the headline,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.480
at least for us,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.300
is Python is now

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.760
the most used

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.500
language on GitHub

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.040
as global open source

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.840
activity continues

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840
to extend beyond

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.760
traditional software

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.200
development.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.680
I've long thought

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.700
that that's the

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.980
magic of Python

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.040
is it's not just,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.080
wow, this is a

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.600
cool front-end

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.000
framework.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.140
Or, wow,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.840
this is a cool

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.560
server-like

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.140
language that many

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.660
people coming

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.700
from other areas

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.440
that are not

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.360
traditional developers

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.580
really dive into it,

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:00.740
right?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.140
Yeah.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.300
So we saw Python

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.080
emerge for the first

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.640
time as the most

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.240
used language.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.140
The rise of Python

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:06.920
usage correlates

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.820
with large communities

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.640
of people joining

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.580
open source community

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.560
from across the

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.760
STEM world rather

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.480
than traditional

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.160
community of

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.800
software developers,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.160
right?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.100
No big surprise

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.360
there.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.280
They also talk

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.480
about where people

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.880
are, where their

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.660
developers are in

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.000
the world.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.660
there's three places

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.700
that notably stand

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:25.960
out.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.100
And again, what is

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.680
the metric here?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.380
I wish they were a

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:30.900
little more clear.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.740
But if you look at

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.100
their, excuse me, if

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.580
you look at their

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.360
heat map thing, then

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.860
that would be the

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.240
United States by far

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.140
closely behind would

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.080
be India and then

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.500
China.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.280
And then after that,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.200
it tails off fast.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.580
But is that divided by,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.420
is that per capita,

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:51.740
right?

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.080
Like just maybe there's

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.660
more people in China

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.480
than, or in India or

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:56.920
America.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.100
But if you look at

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.760
this, they've got some

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.420
cool projections into,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.800
I think this is, they

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.860
have over time, but

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.200
they also have

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.640
projections into the

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.880
future, kind of like

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.460
Stack Overflow

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.300
Trends did when they

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:09.740
came out with their

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.180
big article.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:10.860
So that's pretty

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.180
interesting.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:12.980
And you can sort of

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.000
see where your place

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.480
lands.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.620
I think there's, there's

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.240
a lot of interesting

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.900
things here.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.340
Yeah, projecting into

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:19.760
the future.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.980
They're projecting that

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:21.820
India is going to take

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.720
over the United States

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.060
and the U.S. is going

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.820
to fall to number two.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.480
But also, like,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.460
Indonesia jumps up

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.140
three places.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.260
All right, a lot of

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.100
interesting stuff there.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.500
Let's jump over and

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.960
grab a few more of

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.180
them.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.020
Oh, no, go away thing.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:50.000
This thing is so hard

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.320
to navigate.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:50.940
It's so big.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.180
Okay.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.520
So there continues to be

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.620
an increase in first-time

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.160
contributors.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.260
We saw 1.4 million new

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.380
developers globally join

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.400
the open source community.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.420
And, yeah, notably, we

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.640
didn't see, again, this is

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.400
one of their metrics that

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.220
was actually they called

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:06.400
out.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.960
Notably, we did not see a

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.060
rise in rejected pull

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.400
requests.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.820
So, anyway, there is a

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.680
bunch to see here.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.840
I think one more I'd like

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.180
to hit on is the rise of

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:15.920
Jupyter Notebooks.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.100
If you look at their graph

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.360
of Jupyter Notebooks on

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.840
GitHub, it is the most

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.540
Silicon Valley hockey stick

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.200
dream you've ever seen,

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:30.460
right?

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.380
There's a little glitch.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.620
Something in 2020.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.800
I don't know what

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.500
happened in 2020.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.900
Nobody remembers that

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.160
anyway.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.800
but, no, just kidding.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.140
Maybe a little

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:39.400
pandemic.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.740
Other than the pandemic,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.160
like, this thing is just

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.500
blasting off.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.160
So this is really

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.220
interesting to see.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.280
Yeah.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.140
Yeah.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.040
And AI is maybe following

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.120
a similar thing, just

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.440
ever so slightly behind.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.080
Anyway, this is a deep

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.240
article that has lots of

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.580
insights across many, many

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.340
aspects.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.340
So that's my big item of

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.520
the week, and I think

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.220
people should check it

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:02.360
out.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.020
It's pretty interesting.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.520
Yeah.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.620
That's interesting.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.880
A comment from Liz from

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.340
the audience.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.920
My brother is a front-end

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.020
dev and started learning

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.100
Python last week because

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.080
he's feeling the need to

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.180
become full stack.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.180
So job security stuff, some

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.680
of the JavaScript people are

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.180
learning Python also, maybe.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.080
Yeah.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.020
Thanks for sharing, Liz.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:23.400
Awesome.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.160
Cool.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.800
Now, let's talk about one

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.900
of our sponsors before we

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.380
move on, huh?

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.120
All right.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.220
Let me tell you real quick

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.300
about Scout APM.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.040
They're big supporters of

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.020
Python Bytes, so we

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.080
appreciate that very much.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.260
So if you are tired of

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.100
spending hours trying to

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.220
find the root cause of

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.240
issues impacting your

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.240
performance, then you owe

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.580
it to yourself to check out

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.040
Scout APM.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.880
They're a leading Python

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.120
application performance

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.800
monitoring tool, APM, that

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.060
helps you identify and solve

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.520
performance abnormalities

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.620
faster and easier.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.860
Scout APM ties bottlenecks

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.260
such as memory leaks, slow

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.460
database queries, background

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.860
jobs, and the dreaded N

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.200
plus one queries that you

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.180
can end up if you do lazy

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.180
loading in your ORM, and

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.640
then you say, oh, no, why

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.340
is it so slow?

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.040
Why are you doing 200

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.240
database queries for what

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.700
should be one?

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.300
So you can find out things

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:17.700
like that.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.260
And it links it back

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.280
directly to source code.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440
So you can spend less

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.880
time in the debugger and

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.400
tailing logs and just

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.740
finding the problems and

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.140
moving on.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.960
And you'll love it because

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.440
it's built for developers by

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:29.860
developers.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.100
It makes it easy to get

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.520
set up.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.780
Seriously, you can do it in

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.040
less than four minutes.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.860
So that's awesome.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.340
And the best part is the

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.920
pricing is straightforward.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.620
You only pay for the data

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.220
that you use with no hidden

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.920
overage fees or per seat

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.460
pricing.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.960
And I just learned this,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.560
Brian, they also have they

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.500
provide the pro version for

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.780
free to all open source

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.280
projects.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.540
So if you're an open source

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.900
maintainer and you want to

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.440
have Scout APM for that

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.780
project, just shoot them a

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.720
message or something on their

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.620
pricing page about that.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.100
So you can start your free

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.540
trial and get instant

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.520
insights today.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.700
Visit by them by set of him

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.780
slash Scout.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.000
The link is in your podcast

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
player show notes as well.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.420
And please use that link.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.720
Don't just search for them

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.060
because otherwise they don't

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.920
think you came from us.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.900
And then they'd stop

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.520
supporting the show.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.780
So please use our link

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.080
pythonbytes.fm/scout.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.000
Check them out.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.980
It really supports the show.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.460
Sure does.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.160
Brian, over to you.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.300
Sorry.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.140
Yeah, I want to talk about

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.660
Python 313 again.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.500
We talked about Python 313

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.100
quite a bit on the show so

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:35.340
far.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.960
and we even talked about

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.220
14 last week.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.840
But there's an article that I

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.020
ran across from Bytecode

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.120
saying Python 313, what

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.460
didn't make the headlines?

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.540
And there's a few things I

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.940
want to call out that I

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.060
actually missed also.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.120
So I'm glad that they wrote

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:51.500
this up.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.460
So there's we had a whole

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.340
bunch of nice new additions

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.280
to the REPL.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.440
So like multi-line code

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.060
code block or multi-line code

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.940
editing and and some colors

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.360
and stuff.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.440
But a lot of those have

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.180
trickled down to PDB now.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.060
So I I didn't really possibly

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.380
I didn't notice this too much

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.040
because I usually debug within

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.540
VS Code or PyCharm.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.720
but sometimes I do use PDB.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.140
There's it's I'm glad it's around.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.840
It's a nice Python.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.960
PDB is the Python debugger if

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.500
you're unfamiliar.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.380
But what did PDB get?

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.440
It got multi-line editing, which

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.600
is just cool.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.520
It got code completion just like

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.040
the REPL.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.100
What's some other things?

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.000
Break accepts dotted paths.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.300
I really know what that means.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:42.960
Huh.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.720
So you can easily add breakpoints

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.960
to any lib dynamically.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.060
Oh, that makes sense.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.720
Is it maybe like dot dots slash

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.820
this or dot dot, you know,

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.200
kind of the relative imports?

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:54.940
Yeah.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.800
Probably.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.660
Anyway, mostly the first two I'm

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.560
really pretty excited about.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.860
Code completion and multi-line

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:01.940
editing within PDB.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.580
That's a great, great addition.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.480
So cool to have those those go

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.520
into PDB as well.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.480
Some and yeah.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.780
What else do I want to highlight?

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.880
There's a few other things in

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.780
here that I thought were pretty

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.080
cool.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:22.080
There's Pathlib had some a lot of

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.240
performance optimizations, which

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:24.820
is great.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.340
Because I love I use Pathlib all

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.080
the time now.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.700
So if it's a little bit faster.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.120
Great.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:32.520
Awesome.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.760
I like that.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.100
And shutil, shellutil.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:36.980
Yeah.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.680
Yeah.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.920
Do you use shellutil much?

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.960
Yeah, a little bit.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.560
Not a ton.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.020
But when I want it, it's like

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:42.740
very welcome.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.800
Yeah.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.720
The shutil or shutil.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.620
I never know how to pronounce

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:49.880
that.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.700
It's probably shutil.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.320
Anyway.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.860
Yeah.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.680
What did we say about that?

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.880
The shutil module providing

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.980
high-level file system operations

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.700
such as recursive delete and copy

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.940
has seen tweaks.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.560
Many, many bugs were fixed and

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.680
options were added.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.600
You can choose how to handle

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.220
sim links.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.100
Oh, that's cool.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.300
Ooh.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.560
Yeah.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:15.580
Yeah.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.660
I'm going to have to check that out.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.400
That's great.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.840
And then one of the things about

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.740
virtual environments, which I did

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.640
not know, scroll to the end.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.400
So I've been enjoying this with,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.360
I've been, when creating virtual

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.420
environments with UV,

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.140
V,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.400
MV, it creates a little dot get

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.080
ignore so that the entire thing gets,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.920
your virtual environment directory

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.520
gets ignored.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.320
But,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:39.660
uh,

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.940
Python dash M V and V does that.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.480
Now the built-in virtual environment,

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:43.980
um,

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.300
tool.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:44.680
Nice.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.600
Adds that as well.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.560
Speaking of that though,

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.940
this is kind of a tangent,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.220
but I just learned,

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.120
I can't,

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.480
I can't,

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:51.940
I think I,

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.680
I can't remember where I learned it

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:53.860
from.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:54.460
Somebody on,

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:54.760
uh,

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.120
on Mastodon,

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.880
um,

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.880
I think it may have been Jeff

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.200
Triplett,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.100
but I'm not sure.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:16:59.940
Um,

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.340
said that,

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.000
uh,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.480
one of the things I've noticed when I

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.160
use a virtual environment created by

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.940
UV is that it doesn't install pip.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.880
So pip's not there.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.460
So you use uv pip instead,

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.140
but you can have it install pip there.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.780
You could just,

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:14.080
um,

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:14.900
Oh,

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.580
what is it?

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:15.780
You,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.360
you add a flag --seed.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.040
I believe it is.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.700
Dash dash seed.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.220
That's it.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.460
I'm glad I didn't write it down.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.000
So,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.760
um,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.920
if you miss a pip from a uv virtual

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.360
environment,

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:26.820
add,

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.380
add it with --seed.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.620
So anyway,

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.460
um,

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:30.840
cool.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.860
I'm glad that,

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.200
um,

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.000
glad this article,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.400
Ooh,

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.260
uh,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.240
re functions such as find all split search

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:37.920
and sub,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.460
um,

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.120
can now be interpreted.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.380
Hmm.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.080
Uh,

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:43.920
was,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.080
which performed short repeated matches can now

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.640
be interpreted by the user.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:48.580
interrupted,

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.140
uh,

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.200
interrupted by user.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.180
I read that wrong.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.080
Um,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.520
so some of these could go off,

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:53.860
um,

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.200
go off and do things that,

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.660
uh,

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.560
that are evil and stop,

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.340
uh,

00:17:59.340 --> 00:17:59.540
your,

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.440
your code.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.160
And now you can control C it.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.660
That's good.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.700
So these are,

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.080
there,

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.500
there's lots of great new things in the Python 313.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.080
I've just jumped in and started using it and I think it just

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.740
works great.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.040
So,

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.820
uh,

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.380
that's very cool.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:11.740
Yeah.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.960
I switched to using it as well.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.640
Anyway.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.540
All right.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.420
And Python bites the websites running on it too,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:17.880
by the way.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.160
So,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.580
Oh,

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.040
nice.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.600
Why wouldn't it?

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.440
Why wouldn't it?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.080
Yeah.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.820
All right.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.060
So shall we talk conferences,

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.580
Brian?

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.660
Sure.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.960
Let's talk conferences.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.220
So I saw you had an extra on this,

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.700
but I had already pipped it for the main one.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.240
See that for double meaning there.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:42.360
So PyCon us 2025 is now officially announced in terms of specific details.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.300
It's pretty cool.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:43.620
I'm,

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.220
I'm pretty excited.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.240
It's back in Pittsburgh because it's year two of the two year deal.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.580
So if you went last year,

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.660
same deal,

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:51.220
if you didn't,

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:51.500
well,

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.480
we had a lot of fun there,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.480
so you can check it out.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.700
There's,

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.280
um,

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.420
many interesting things.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.580
The website doesn't make it incredibly clear.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:18:59.820
Oh yeah.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.740
Here you scroll down far enough.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.080
Perfect.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:01.820
The breakdown.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.980
So if you go down here to the breakdown,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.860
I think this is probably the first question people have.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.940
There's two questions.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.000
I imagine many people would have straight up here.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.400
The first one is when is it?

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.800
Cause it has a huge span of eight days that the conference is,

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.840
but it's not really those dates depending on what you want to do.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.880
For example,

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.520
tutorials are may 14 and 15 2025,

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.840
but the main conference is 16 to 18.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.000
there's a good chance that you will find me at the main conference.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.560
I plan on going unless something comes up with family commitments or something I can't make,

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:34.820
you know,

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.220
but the plan right now for me is to go to the main conference and that's pretty much it.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.660
But how about you?

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.120
Do you think you might go this year?

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.260
I have a hair appointment on that day.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:44.500
No,

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.640
I understand.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.260
Your hair is pretty amazing these days.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.440
So it does need a lot of attention.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.760
It's pretty far out.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.300
I'm not sure.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:51.700
Um,

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.980
I'm still on the fence with it.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.420
Um,

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.680
with this one.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:54.980
So,

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.600
yep.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.240
Okay.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.600
So that's question number one.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.200
When is it?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.000
Question number two.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.700
Call for proposals.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.420
No,

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.440
that's number three.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.860
Number two is,

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.980
do I have to wear a mask all day?

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.480
Are we going into like a different time?

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.100
Are we going to like,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:13.660
Hey,

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.640
let's pretend the world isn't the way it is,

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.520
but it is a different way.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:16.980
No.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.540
In fact,

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.000
that's exactly the policy that I hoped it would be.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.100
And I strongly encourage it.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.700
Just like the policy is mass are strongly encouraged,

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.720
but not required.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.940
Please respect people who wear their choose to wear a mask.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.600
Great.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.900
If you don't want to,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:30.800
you don't have to.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.380
Yeah,

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.520
that's great.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.500
That seems reasonable.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.160
That seems congruent with the world right now.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.100
I might go extreme and,

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.180
and wear like a mask and flight goggles.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.480
I was going to say,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.860
put on like some ski gear,

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.600
put on some goggles and a helmet and.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.660
Snorkel.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:46.960
No,

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.440
this is,

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:47.740
I,

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.360
yeah,

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:48.760
snorkel.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.020
Well,

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:49.700
just bring your,

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.560
your Apple vision pro,

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.360
put on your snorkel.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.260
Yeah.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.380
That'd be funny to put like a,

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.880
like a COVID mask on the top of the snorkel at the end.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.160
Yeah.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.400
A little,

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:01.740
no,

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:01.960
this,

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.760
this is really good.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.180
So they're taking lots of precautions,

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:05.860
you know,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.280
as you should hand sanitize,

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.220
hand sanitizing stations.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.960
Conferences are full of germs,

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:11.980
regardless of COVID.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.980
Please have these kinds of things.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:14.200
Right.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.340
And things like,

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:15.460
Hey,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.560
we have outdoor areas where eating will be available.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.460
If anyone's listening.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.260
and they're,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.900
they're in charge of this.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.220
I just want to encourage you.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.040
Yes.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:26.520
Chairs,

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:26.820
please.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.880
Last time there was a roof area with a,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.060
like a cover and it was beautiful.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.280
You could see over the river and there were these tall,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.000
tall tables,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
no chairs.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.120
And my back just hurt so much after carrying all the recording equipment on my

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.920
back for half a day.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.140
I'm like,

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.200
I just got to sit down somewhere.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.900
There was literally not a single chair.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.180
like,

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.360
could there just be a chair?

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.140
So chairs,

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:46.540
please.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.240
Some chairs.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.420
But other than that,

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.200
I think this is great.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.660
So one chair with a tag on it.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.600
This is for Michael.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.380
Yeah,

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:53.740
exactly.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.520
Please reserved.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.040
The dude's back hurts a lot.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.600
Just look at him.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.500
He's whinging over there.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:58.800
All right.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.520
And then somewhere in here,

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.460
there's call for proposals.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.220
Speaking.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:03.720
Under speaking.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.760
Yes.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.940
Preparing the talk.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.520
Important deadline.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.480
We have just over a month.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.960
But it's open now.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.560
You can start.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.240
Yeah.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:15.400
Yeah.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.120
So there it is.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.120
There it is.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.980
So awesome.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:20.480
I'm excited.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.360
I'm excited.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:21.680
Oh,

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.660
hopefully I'll be there.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.400
Super excited.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.400
I think I'll get a couple of talks.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.000
Yeah.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.340
See,

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:27.860
look at that.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.280
Look at that.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:28.400
Yeah.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.140
Very good.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.560
Plus the website is beautiful.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.640
I like that.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:32.880
It is.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.460
I like the design.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:33.800
It's got a good,

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.800
it's got a good fun vibe.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.820
And I know you have previously,

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.220
maybe still do skateboarding.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.120
Look at that guy just riding that rail there.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:41.560
I mean,

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.380
already you want to go,

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:42.600
right?

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.580
Is there?

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.040
They're probably going to have skateboard,

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.360
skate parks at the conference,

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:46.860
I guess.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.580
Yeah.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.980
I would say why not.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.500
I imagine.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.000
Why not?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.400
Oh,

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:50.820
the snake.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.220
A sweet,

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.300
a sweet half pike,

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.060
half pipe.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.060
Yeah.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.060
That's what is the snake riding?

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.520
Anyway,

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.480
it's sort of a skate.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.140
I think it's a skateboard with beans on the line.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.340
Oh,

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:02.500
no,

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.060
those are just,

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:03.820
I don't know.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.300
Those are just good wheels.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.000
Yeah.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.200
Well,

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.900
we're trying to put a lot of meaning into this.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.900
No.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:12.860
Anyway.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.500
Okay.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.380
All right.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:14.920
Well,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.420
before we get to our extras,

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.140
let's quickly talk about Codeium.

Thank you to Codeium for supporting Python Bytes.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.360
Awesome.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:33.680
Awesome.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.740
How about extras?

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.860
How extra are you feeling?

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.720
I only got one extra.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:42.060
And that is to say,

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.860
this is from Jeff Triplett saying,

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.760
please publish and share more.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:52.060
And he did talk about this on Mastodon a little bit.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:25:00.760
The thought is that he sees a lot of great ideas on Mastodon and people posting.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:08.000
And the thought process and research and stuff that goes into publishing a couple of those ideas and maybe their threads,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.220
you're almost to a post.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.440
Just write it up.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.500
And I totally agree.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.800
It's great to post on social media,

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:26.620
but why not just write it on a blog and then do a snippet of it and link to it from Mastodon or whatever social you're posting it on.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.660
Totally agree.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.000
And I encourage people to do that more.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.680
And there's a little bit around it,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.540
like talking about,

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.040
he says he uses Grammarly because of dyslexia,

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.540
which is,

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.040
I didn't know that about Jeff.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.680
That's pretty cool.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.040
And I don't mean to plug Grammarly,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.920
but it did help one of my kids get through college.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.040
This episode is sponsored by Grammarly.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.180
But if you don't want to pay for something,

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.160
he's also recommending something called Language Tool.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.200
There's a link to it in his post.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.380
It's pretty cool.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.480
But also,

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.120
you don't really need to do that.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.000
It's fine to just,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.360
I mean,

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.180
we're all nerds here.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.520
Write up something you learned,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.200
post it on a blog,

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.460
and link to it in a Mastodon post or something.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.440
Let us know about it.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:13.920
And,

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.980
you know,

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:20.280
if there's something glaringly technical editors or technical errors,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.560
one of your readers will let you know to fix it.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.320
But it's to be nice.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.220
It's not to be mean.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.580
And I encourage that too.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.600
I don't,

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.800
I actually don't use any grammar checkers when I'm writing blog posts.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.220
I just put it on there.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:36.900
Nice.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.760
Yeah,

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.140
you and I both have our blogs.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:39.780
on Hugo,

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.880
which you write with Markdown.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.380
And I have a little bit of a hack for folks if they also do that.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.800
I've started writing my posts,

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.100
my longer posts at least,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.640
on something like Google Docs,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.500
where you get grammar checking and help and auto-complete and all that kind of stuff.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.780
And I've found if you just control A,

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.900
control C,

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.000
and paste it into Typeora,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.180
it will Markdownify everything.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.300
like H2s become hash hash things,

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.340
and all the links become bracket links,

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.840
and bolds,

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.540
all that kind of stuff.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.080
Really,

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.460
really nice.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.760
if you want a little bit of support,

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.860
but then you're also doing Markdown,

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:19.680
that's a pretty sweet one.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.980
Paste it to where?

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.840
Appfora?

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.340
Typeora.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.180
Typeora.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.260
Typeora.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:24.420
Typeora.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:24.540
What?

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.960
Typeora is an amazing Markdown editor.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.560
Yeah,

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.360
Typeora is really good.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.000
Huh.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.420
I usually just use VS Code,

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:37.680
and it does enough grammar and spelling checking for me.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.680
Did you know that Typeora you can save as an EPUB file if you want?

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.600
Mm-hmm.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.780
Okay,

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.440
that's pretty cool.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.220
I mean, all sorts of good stuff in there.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.720
You can write an e-book.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:48.820
Exactly.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.600
Exactly.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:49.980
Anyway,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.840
that's pretty cool.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.040
All right.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.900
All right.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.820
I got a couple extras,

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.780
but I'll go quick.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:28:00.380
I just recently had Stephanie Molin on to talk about pre-commit hooks.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.500
I think I talked about that.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.760
That was going to be on,

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.680
and now it has happened.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.200
Now I'm talking about it having happened.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:11.880
The reason I bring that up is one of the things that I just ran across is pre-commit uv.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.580
So this is pretty cool.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.620
From the Tox dev group.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:23.600
uses uv to create virtual environments and installing packages for pre-commit rather than regular ones.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.420
So that's pretty cool.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.500
So, you know,

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.300
that's something that Tox and Nox and friends all do a lot of.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.140
So pretty cool.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.560
People can check that out if they like.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.780
Nice.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.200
Why?

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.440
Why, Brian, was I using Pocket?

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.280
Did you see how much I had to struggle with that thing?

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:43.220
That's because my favorite read later thing is shutting down.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.340
Omnivore is shutting down.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.160
Not because they went out of business because they were awesome,

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.500
but because they got bought and they decided it's too expensive to run.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.160
Text-based highlights?

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.080
I don't know.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.000
It doesn't seem that intense.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.340
It's not profitable enough.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.620
It's not.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.340
And I mean,

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.120
get on it, folks.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.180
Because one of people who started using it,

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.320
because we recommended it,

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.180
pointed this out to me.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:20.060
Omnivore will support exports of your data into JSON,

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.260
because what are you going to do with that,

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.780
until November 30th?

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.840
And then after that time,

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.360
we will be deleting all of your data.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.500
So yeah,

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.040
have fun with that.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.480
There's a lot of options.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.040
Readwise has been recommended.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.240
Pocket is an option.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:35.860
Instapaper.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.420
I found some really cool open source,

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.340
self-hosted ones.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:39.800
I'm like,

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.500
no, Michael,

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.220
you don't need more things to babysit.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.820
Just log back into Pocket.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.940
I've been using Pocket.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.580
It works for me.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.220
It's not great,

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.160
but it works.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.380
It's pretty good.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.520
I didn't realize Instapaper was still around.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.100
I was using that back in the day.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.140
Yeah, I know.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:29:59.500
Me too.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.740
Back in the day.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.300
It was a good one.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:02.680
All right.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.380
The voices, though.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.920
And that's what they were required by.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.360
They were required by this thing called 11 Labs,

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.080
which is all about creating Givit audio.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.180
And I was pretty excited.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:13.340
I'm like,

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:13.460
oh,

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.680
this might just make it even better.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.520
free text-to-speech and voice generated.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:17.740
I'm like,

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:18.000
okay,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.440
I could just download that and check it out,

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:19.660
right?

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.160
But if you look at the pricing,

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.540
it's ridiculous.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.540
I mean,

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.900
you get,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.700
for five bucks a month,

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.960
you get 30 minutes of speech.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.300
I mean,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.040
that's like e-book,

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.520
audio book prices,

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.060
but they don't generate the book.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:37.940
They just speak it.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.740
For $11,

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.780
you get an hour and a half per month.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.520
I'm like,

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.060
okay,

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.500
if your only purpose is to,

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.560
to read stuff in audio to somebody and say like,

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.500
you only get 30 minutes of it per month.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.700
I don't know.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.220
It's kind of weird,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:51.940
but.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.360
And the jump between that and 99 bucks,

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:55.820
11,

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.920
11 to $99.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.900
That's a big jump.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.820
That's a month.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.460
That's not a year.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.840
To have it read you text off the internet.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.600
That's pretty steep.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.620
So I,

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.660
I was kind of excited,

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.080
but I'm like not excited.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.300
So the text in the show notes is curse you.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:10.760
I'm never over.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.280
Curse you.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.300
Hey,

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.660
I talked about moving to Hetzner and some of the U S data centers.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.600
And I played around with that.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.180
And you know what?

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.260
Python buys a run on Hetzner right now.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:20.580
Oh,

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.180
nice.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:28.480
And talk Python and all the things because of the whole new Docker cluster sort of portable across cloud thing that I did before.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.960
It was pretty easy to just try it out.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.360
And I'm like,

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:31.480
Hey,

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.160
this works really well.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:41.820
I'm going to try it because you get really nice new CPUs like AMD epic CPUs and stuff along those lines,

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:42.500
which is great.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.120
And this is not a massive concern,

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:46.740
but wow,

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.980
are the prices good for this thing.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.760
So for example,

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.600
check this out.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.200
We could go to the U S and you could get it in Hillsborough or Ashland.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.360
Ashland unfortunately makes more sense for the consumers,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.020
but I wanted to run it locally here because Hillsborough is just outside of Portland.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.240
Anyway,

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:03.660
Ashland,

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:10.460
but totally reasonable to run it for $13 a month or something or $20 a month.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.880
Like for example,

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.180
they have a $25 a month,

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.280
eight gig,

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.240
eight CPU,

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.840
16 gig server with 20 terabytes of bandwidth.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:27.720
That is a $250 AWS server and a $300 Azure server for 25 bucks.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.480
So anyway,

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.340
pretty interesting stuff.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.060
25 euro,

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:30.640
but that's,

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.080
yeah,

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:31.480
that's true.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:31.760
Euro,

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.080
sorry.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:32.300
It's,

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:32.920
they're pretty close.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.580
Yeah.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.380
E bucks,

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.500
euro bucks.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.060
Okay.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.380
Also,

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.840
we've talked previously about free threader Python over and over,

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.380
but there is now a pretty awesome new thing that you can do with uv.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.540
I know we're talking a lot about uv these days,

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.860
but that's because it's making a big splash and it's really cool.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:56.600
UV Python install --preference only managed.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.980
And if 13,

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:06.020
three dot 13 T will create you either install or create you a virtual environment on three,

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.360
free threaded Python.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.440
How cool is that?

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:08.980
Okay.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:09.820
We've been waiting for that.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:10.460
So that's cool.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.100
Yeah.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:11.360
Yeah.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:11.880
That's really neat.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.160
So probably the quickest,

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:13.580
you know,

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.940
you can see I ran an example.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.280
I've been linking to a master on post,

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.700
a screenshot I posted in 2.53 seconds to install free threaded Python.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.640
It's that close to,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.820
and that's of course why the pre-commit hooks want to use this to install other things and so on.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:27.600
Yeah.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.660
That's pretty neat.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.000
Also,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.640
remember if you're going to try something like that,

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.280
you probably need to do a uv self update first.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.140
Yes.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.160
That's a very good point,

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.400
Brian,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.100
because it doesn't check remotely.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.600
It just knows what's burnt into the binary of uv.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.620
And if you don't uv self update,

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.660
it will only possibly know the old one.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:45.960
So yeah,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.240
that's,

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.700
that's always the place to start with uv.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.160
It seems.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:49.680
Yeah.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.240
I just updated a three through just the normal three 13 the other day and it wouldn't work.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.200
Like why not?

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.840
And it was because I needed to self update.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.600
Yeah.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.000
Good,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.280
good,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.460
good deal.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.080
All right.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.540
That wasn't very funny,

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.700
but I have something.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.140
I don't know.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.120
We'll see if it's funny or not,

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:03.900
but I have something for you.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.460
You ready?

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.640
Ready to close out with a joke?

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.160
Yes.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.160
All right.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.320
So we have different kinds of chairs in life.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:10.920
Did you know that,

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.140
Brian?

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.240
Like you can have one of the gaming chairs.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.280
You can have an,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.960
I have a slightly uncomfortable chair,

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.820
so I don't move around away from my mic and go like this and then like this and like,

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.080
sort of keeps me fixed,

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.980
but it's not that comfy.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:27.240
But I would like to present to you two types of chairs that are in opposition to each other

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:27.500
or,

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.100
uh,

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.280
no,

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.000
this is a synergy.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:29.920
Let's call this a synergy.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:30.900
You have a coding chair,

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.200
which looks like an office chair.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.140
And you have the debugging chair,

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.320
which looks like a toilet.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:41.140
Just two of the different types of chairs you may try to sit in.

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.260
Yeah.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.380
Actually,

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:43.840
you know,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.520
if,

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.800
if it's just the,

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.180
the thought process is,

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:47.520
um,

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.480
take your laptop to the bathroom.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.640
I don't recommend it,

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.100
but,

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:52.860
but if,

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:53.820
I can't leave the bathroom,

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.980
my bug is still out there.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.360
No,

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:55.620
no,

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:55.920
no.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.240
Just get away from the keyboard for a while.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.040
I agree.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:34:59.740
Um,

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.340
but yeah,

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:00.580
it's,

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.580
yeah.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.740
Yeah.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.820
I think the message here,

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:05.220
the,

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:08.900
the underlying reality of the joke is that sometimes if you just step away,

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.460
it unlocks,

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.240
yeah,

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.540
unlocks problems.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.140
I know when I was doing this migration of all my,

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:15.620
I set up,

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:15.760
I,

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.580
I couldn't get let's encrypt to work and that was midnight or something.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.560
Stupid let's encrypt.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.220
I went to sleep.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.780
I was like Docker let's encrypt combo of not working.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.100
Just woke up the next day.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:27.280
I'm like,

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:27.900
yeah,

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.220
that'll do it.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.920
And I just typed in some different boom off.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.200
It went,

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:30.820
you know what I mean?

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.740
But I spent half an hour banging my head against it.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:34.240
I,

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.780
so if this has been,

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.620
this hasn't happened to me for very long,

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.080
but it's been happened to me lately is,

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.380
is I'll be stuck on an issue.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.080
And then,

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.740
and then I wake up early and I think,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.580
and I think about the,

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.280
of one of the possible,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.260
a possible solution,

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.600
something I want to try in the code.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.420
And I'm like,

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:50.660
Oh,

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.540
what time is it?

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:51.880
I mean,

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.220
if it's like just only like an hour before normal,

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:54.760
it's fine.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.440
But often it's like one in the morning.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.160
Oh no,

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.200
I cannot get up.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:58.620
right now.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.520
I will be exhausted in the morning.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.120
So just have to jot it down and go back to sleep.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:04.940
Yeah.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:05.720
Yeah.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.880
Anyway,

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.580
cool.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.140
Well,

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.280
great show as usual.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:09.680
Thanks.
