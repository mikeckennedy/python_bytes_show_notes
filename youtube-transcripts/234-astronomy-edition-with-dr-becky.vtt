00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000
- Hey everyone. Hey Brian. Hey Dr. Becky. - Hey. - Hey. - So good to see you too. Everyone out in the live stream, thank you for being here. Please put comments and thoughts into the live chat. And with that, I guess we will kick it off.


00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
>> Cool. Oh. >> Yeah, go ahead, Brian. Want me to do it?


00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.640
>> Yeah. Aren't you going to do like the -- >> Yes, I have to figure out -- I forgot what


00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.080
the episode number was. But it's 234. It's always different every time. It's so weird.


00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.600
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly


00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.680
to your earbuds. This is episode 234. And it's May 19th, 2021. I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.680
And I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.280
And we have our special guest, Dr. Becky Smithers.


00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.280
Welcome.


00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.280
Hi.


00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.120
I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to introduce myself then.


00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.120
I was like, "Should I jump in?


00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120
Should I wait?"


00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.400
This is standard fare for our podcast.


00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.160
We do a bad job preparing our guests for jumping in.


00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.160
Welcome.


00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.160
I love casual podcasts.


00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.840
They're my favorite to listen to, and they're now my favorite to be a part of as well.


00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.840
Yeah.


00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.840
Nice.


00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.840
Absolutely.


00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.840
Yeah.


00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.840
So it's really good to have you here.


00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.240
doing so many neat things out on the internet.


00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.280
First of all, you're an astrophysicist


00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.680
at University of Oxford.


00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.520
- That is my day job, technically.


00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.560
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.540
You've written some books.


00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.040
You can tell folks about that.


00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.720
You are doing quite a bunch of interesting things


00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.600
over on YouTube, which is how I came to know you.


00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.040
Your work on YouTube is really neat.


00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.400
And yeah, maybe just tell people


00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.040
real quickly about yourself.


00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.640
- Yeah, sure, so I'm an astrophysicist.


00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.720
My day job is essentially to study supermassive black holes


00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.960
and figure out the effect that they have on their galaxies


00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.560
and how they might stop their galaxies from forming stars,


00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.300
which is kind of awesome.


00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.640
I'm living the dream as an eight-year-old


00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.440
to become like a natural space scientist.


00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.300
And yeah, I just love talking about science and space


00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.200
with people as well.


00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.800
And I've sort of found my niche a little bit on YouTube,


00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.120
really, that I can put out videos each week


00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.240
about fun things in space or even react to old sci-fi


00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.960
and stuff like that about what they got right


00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.240
and what they got wrong necessarily.


00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.240
And it's just a great platform to communicate with people


00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.520
and respond to people's questions


00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.840
that they've never been able to Google.


00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.160
The tagline is your friendly neighborhood astrophysicist.


00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.560
- Yeah, I absolutely recommend that people check out,


00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.680
I don't know why that doesn't work.


00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.640
I absolutely recommend that people check out


00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.480
your YouTube channel, it is super neat.


00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.160
And yeah, there's a ton of fun videos there.


00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.320
They're very good sort of general science,


00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.840
just like interested in science,


00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.640
not scientists type of presentations.


00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.680
So super cool, super cool.


00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.960
All right, Brian, you got the first item, right?


00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.000
You wanna take it away?


00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.360
- Yeah, sure.


00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.560
Dustin Ingram just recently released an updated version


00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.560
of an article called "Powering the Python Package Index


00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.560
in 2021.


00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.700
Apparently there was one, I think,


00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.120
like in the name, Donald Stuff did one about five years ago


00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.680
to list how this was going on.


00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.640
So this is one of the, this is kind of amazing to read.


00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.760
There's just some cool information here.


00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.280
There were three maintainers,


00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.040
but it was mostly Donald five years ago.


00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.660
And now there are still three maintainers,


00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.340
but there's, it's Donald, Ernest Durbin,


00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.720
and Dustin Ingram all doing the maintainers,


00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.100
but there's also more people.


00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.700
So there's more people involved.


00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.860
There's five different moderators


00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.980
and three committers that help with the project.


00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.820
So that's neat.


00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.380
And we've all seen, it's just,


00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.700
people are using it a lot more


00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.180
and it's a more central part of our everyday life.


00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.000
So.


00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.100
- Yeah, so what are some of the,


00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.780
I remember one of the really interesting things


00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.780
is just how much it costs to run PyPI.org


00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.300
and the whole like all the data transfer behind the scenes


00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.300
and stuff like that.


00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.780
- Yeah, so let's jump to some of the data.


00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.420
The data that they showed was just sort of mind blowing.


00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.260
We've got,


00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:29.660
we're up to 1.7 billion requests on PyPI per day,


00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.660
sometimes in 55.4 terabytes every day.


00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.360
five times more than even from 2018.


00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.740
That's ridiculous.


00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.600
- Yeah, so this is an amazing amount of data


00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.440
goes through there.


00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.440
And then they have data on files.pythonhosted.org.


00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.120
Also, there's some data on there.


00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.940
The money that goes into it,


00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.520
Fastly takes care of a lot of the brunt of the work.


00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.520
So Fastly apparently is donating about,


00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.220
what's the number?


00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.980
$1.8 million of services a month,


00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.620
if we were to have to pay for the Fastly services directly.


00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.740
- Oh my God.


00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.660
- And they give PyPI a 100% discount, so that's great.


00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.780
And about $10,000 worth of services a month from Google


00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.100
and 7,000 from AWS, and then a whole slew of other people


00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.040
that help out too, like Datadog, which is cool.


00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.660
And then there's some other funding sources


00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.020
that we've had some grants,


00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.340
and we've talked about some of the grants that came through,


00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.740
but these are funding some amazing projects


00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.100
like the rewrite of PyPI, localization,


00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.220
some malware detection,


00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.100
which is really needed when everybody's depending on this.


00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.300
And now some support staff,


00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.620
they're hiring a project manager soon.


00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.460
So.


00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.300
- Yeah, that's fantastic.


00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.060
Google came on as a visionary sponsor


00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.300
specifically to work on this


00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.580
and the security side of that, I believe.


00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.120
Yeah, one of the things I didn't know about,


00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.620
which we're going to provide a link to,


00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.520
is the team maintains a thing called a fundables markdown page,


00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.120
which is a non-exhaustive wish list of large projects


00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.120
they'd like to see happen.


00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.620
-Oh, nice. -So it'd be kind of...


00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.920
It's sort of like looking forward, what are we going to do?


00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.420
But it's, if we can do it, we'd like to do this.


00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.160
So that's kind of neat.


00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.120
That's amazing. I'd never stopped to think


00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.120
about how much work and how many people must use PyPy,


00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.280
PyPI, I don't know how you, I say PyPy.


00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.240
But like, every time I type in pip now,


00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.000
I'm gonna think differently.


00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.840
Like it's just, to me it's just been there.


00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.640
Yeah, now I feel like I should go to this fundables list


00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.240
and like, pay, I don't know, like give something back


00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.440
for all the types I've used it,


00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.080
probably in frustration as well,


00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.200
because something else works


00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.480
and not appreciate it all the behind the scenes stuff.


00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.440
- Yeah, the first time I learned about this,


00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.580
I was blown away at how much it takes to keep it going.


00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.320
And how much, you think about how much


00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.400
we all depend upon this as people working in Python.


00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.900
What if it went away tomorrow?


00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.080
- Yeah, it was terrible.


00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.400
- I didn't think about that.


00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.880
(laughing)


00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.280
Most scientific research would probably collapse.


00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.120
(laughing)


00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.240
- You know, one thing I wanted to ask you, Dr. Becky,


00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.180
is I suspect that you use Conda and Anaconda a lot


00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.680
in the data science space, or are you a pip person?


00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.340
I'm a pip person.


00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.320
I don't really use Condor.


00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.360
Some of my colleagues do.


00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.180
It's all just personal preferences, really.


00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.620
I remember for a long time on the departmental computers, the ones that


00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.520
were owned by the physics department, they didn't give you like install control.


00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.500
And so pip wouldn't work and it drove me insane.


00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.640
I had to beg them to put pip on.


00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.180
I was like, no, you can only install like a software that has been approved


00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.680
like by the IT department.


00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.060
And I was just like, oh God.


00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.060
This is not going to work.


00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.060
I know.


00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.060
Yeah, that's really rough.


00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:08.060
All right, super cool. Well, I wanted to try to bring in some astronomy type things that have to do with Python.


00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.060
Nice.


00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.060
Because, of course, you're here, Dr. Becky.


00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:20.060
And Shahran Ahmed, didn't really know that he contributed this to today, but just more of a general conversation item,


00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.580
item put out on Twitter like, "Hey, I was looking for a Python-generated star atlas


00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.100
like the Leuven Star Atlas."


00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.100
Have you heard of this thing?


00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.100
- No, I haven't.


00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.140
The Herschel Star Atlas is the most famous one, but I'm guessing Leuven is a bit of an


00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.140
update.


00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.140
- It's a project by...


00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.940
I'm starting to forget their name.


00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.940
Let's see if I can...


00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.940
Yeah, they just say "I".


00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.820
I have to go back and pull it up later.


00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.820
- Sure.


00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.540
- They wrote this.


00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.980
I doesn't help me, I'm sorry.


00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.380
So it's the goals to make a publication quality


00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.800
stellar Atlas from scratch using Python.


00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.700
So it's pretty neat.


00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.820
And the project's not finished


00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.920
and who knows what the timeline is on it,


00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.060
but I wanted to just give it a shout out more


00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.740
as a way to think about what are the tools


00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.740
that people are using for astronomy and Python


00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.980
and also just building maps.


00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.780
Maybe you want to build a map of something completely different.


00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.420
Maybe you're really into river floating.


00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.380
You want to build amazing maps of river floating or whatever.


00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.660
You could take the public data and overlay the things


00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.100
kind of like they did here.


00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.180
So with this, I'll go and find some pictures down here


00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:32.740
at the end.


00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.060
It's quite a long article talking


00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.100
about how all this works.


00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.700
But there's some really neat graphics that we can find.


00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.900
There we go.


00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.380
So they've got pictures of stars, variable stars, galaxies,


00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:52.300
nebula, planetary nebula, and all kinds of things that you might care about. Fast


00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.620
moving stars, I suspect a lot of those might be


00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.380
looping around black holes. What do you think? I mean yeah,


00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.620
you probably wouldn't see those astrometrically, but you'll probably get


00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.260
all those variable stars that vary in brightness.


00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.620
Yeah, yeah. They call those out particularly with like a


00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.260
a double circle type of icon. Yeah, yeah. So astrometrically means like the


00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.020
astronomy position. So like incredibly precise. So those kind


00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.900
of like what you just described like a wobble from a black hole orbiting it you probably wouldn't see


00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.700
on a starless like this it'd be like too fine of a detail like too much too small of a change yeah


00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:32.300
yeah cool so talks about how you go and create this thing says there's a one plot map.py that's


00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:38.860
a thousand five hundred lines long trying to write all this together they talk about using the


00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.740
in the different libraries.


00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.660
So it was NumPy for all kinds of data handling.


00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.940
It was PyLab and Matplotlib.


00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.420
So all the graphics that you see here


00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.220
are just layers of Matplotlib renderings


00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.020
over and over and over.


00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.980
Yeah, and then there was this library called BaseMap,


00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.420
which takes care of projections and transformations


00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.340
because I think one of the challenges was


00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.540
how do you project this onto paper?


00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.500
You know, when it's on a spherical thing.


00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.020
I think they said they used stereographic projections.


00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:12.860
I don't know.


00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.780
- It sounds about right, yeah.


00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.300
- That's all right, yeah.


00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.900
SciPy, and then of course, Astropy,


00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.620
which I know Dr. Becky used a lot, and then--


00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.060
- Round of applause for Astropy.


00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:22.900
- Woo!


00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.080
And then PyEFM for celestial coordinate transformations.


00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:32.080
So yeah, a lot of neat libraries on there.


00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.580
Sounds like you've used Astropy.


00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.740
Like any of the others sound familiar?


00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.580
- All of them.


00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.420
I've used every single one of those packages before.


00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.900
Um, especially astropi, like I have the same problem with like, I've taken an


00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.180
image with a telescope and it's been taken by a flat digital detector, but


00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.820
there's coordinates that are sort of overlaid on that, that come from the


00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.060
sort of the surface of a sphere.


00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.180
You can think of it as right.


00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.540
And so you project that down using astropi and pi FM as well, because


00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.660
sometimes people work in different coordinates, so you can work in sky


00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.220
coordinates, which is sort of how high you are above the horizon and how far


00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.540
around you are, or you can work in galactic coordinates,


00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.220
like with respect to the center of the Milky Way,


00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.140
like how far out are you and round?


00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.980
And I don't ever work in those,


00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.940
but people who are Milky Way astronomers do,


00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.260
and then you've got to like,


00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.380
so some objects, their coordinates are given


00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.900
in Milky Way coordinates and not sky coordinates.


00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.740
So they'll have to have done so many transformations


00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.140
to get maps like this.


00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.900
What's cool about this map, it's the constellation Cygnus,


00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.920
if you can see that there, that's the swan.


00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.640
It looks like a big cross in the Northern sky.


00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.400
But that is the constellation or the area of sky


00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.000
that the Kepler space telescope stared at.


00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.840
- Oh, nice.


00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.680
So that's where the exoplanets have been discovered.


00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.520
Yeah.


00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.360
- Pretty much, yeah.


00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.200
All of the exoplanets we know of,


00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.740
so some like 5,000 of them will pretty much be


00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.440
in that patch of sky.


00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.320
So I'm really glad they chose that constellation.


00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.160
- Oh yeah, how neat.


00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.240
- To show this piece.


00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.080
Yeah.


00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.900
- How neat.


00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.640
Yeah, and then over here, let's see if I can find it.


00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.360
Talked about the sources of data.


00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.000
There's all these different public sources of data


00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.240
that they put together.


00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.320
But then if you read through the article,


00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.600
you'll find that they were talking about,


00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.440
well, I think they spent a month and a half


00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.800
getting this far on the project.


00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.880
And they're like, well, I went through here


00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.580
and I had to correct all these things


00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.640
'cause they were, this data was a little bit off here


00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.080
and that data was a little bit off there.


00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.960
And then I had to label them.


00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.640
And another thing that was talked about a lot is


00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.080
how do you create these pictures without text that overlaps?


00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.440
So you mentioned this thing's called adjust text


00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.840
and where it'll actually take a matplotlib thing


00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.480
with labels and then rearrange the labels on the graph


00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.000
so that the text doesn't overlap, which is really cool.


00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.840
And it has a nice-


00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.840
- You just changed my life.


00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.960
- Really?


00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.360
- Yes, this is like a huge problem and it's been solved.


00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.720
It exists and it's just Python code.


00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.000
- God, I love when this happens.


00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.840
- Isn't this cool?


00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.680
It's awesome.


00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.000
- I'm just stuck here like jaw on the floor,


00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.100
like, oh, someone's faking it out.


00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.280
- Well, that's awesome.


00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.680
So yeah, there's a bunch of stuff.


00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.680
And one of the things that I really took away from this


00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.160
was it reminds me of this quote


00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.760
that in the whole data science, scientific computing world,


00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.160
like data cleaning isn't the grunt work,


00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.840
it is the work sort of thing.


00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.040
'Cause it's so much about,


00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.300
oh yeah, I could just run these together,


00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.080
but then I spent a month fixing this


00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.120
and correcting that and offsetting that.


00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.160
Yeah.


00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.620
So pretty neat.


00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.200
- That's really cool.


00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.040
- Yeah, I guess the-


00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.720
- I wanna know where I am in galactic coordinates.


00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.080
- Not zero, zero.


00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.320
- I can't remember off the top of my head,


00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.760
but yeah, Earth does have galactic coordinates.


00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.120
I just don't know what they are.


00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.960
- So is the supermassive black hole


00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.800
at the center of the universe,


00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.480
is that at zero, zero, zero?


00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.040
- The center of our galaxy, yeah.


00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.380
So there's many galaxies in the universe,


00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.480
our galaxy is the Milky Way.


00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.400
The supermassive black hole at the center of it would be,


00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.800
- Yes, L equals zero, B equals zero.


00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.720
(laughs)


00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.520
- Okay, awesome.


00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.480
Awesome, yeah, I guess final thought is they say


00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.840
it takes about four hours to generate this map


00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.680
running using four cores running in parallel


00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.000
to actually render it 'cause it has so much data


00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and whatnot, but anyway, pretty neat.


00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.800
If you're looking to build maps with Python,


00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.920
here's a bit of a case study, I suspect.


00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.040
- Is it open source?


00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.000
Like is it on GitHub?


00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.160
Can you grab it yourself and have a play around?


00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.000
- I wish, no, it's not.


00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.800
I looked around, I couldn't find much of the code.


00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.000
There's little snippets of code shown,


00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.440
but yeah, that's all.


00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.920
- I was thinking like, can I get a section of sky?


00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.960
I'm gonna print out, I'm gonna frame it.


00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.400
It's gonna look really cool.


00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.120
- Yeah, this is the one I wanna put on the wall.


00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.960
Yes, you seem like you could do that.


00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.200
- Millennials love maps on walls.


00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.520
- Exactly. - That's what I'm gonna do.


00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.560
- All right, before we move on this,


00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.480
just a quick shout out to Dr. Becky


00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.960
from ProdFund on the live stream.


00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.120
Yay, Dr. Becky is back.


00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.920
Bought your book after watching


00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.800
The live stream with michael really enjoyed it, even though you don't have a space background. So very cool. That's awesome


00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.640
I'm, so glad you enjoyed it


00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.620
Yeah. All right. Speaking of things that we couldn't all enjoy and can take us back calculators


00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.600
Yes


00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.480
I


00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.040
I was thinking about how I haven't I haven't thought about my graphical calculator in a long time


00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.720
Like I swear I was attached at the hip to that thing throughout high school


00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.640
and then a little bit into university but not so much because they were like banned in our university exams because


00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.800
They thought that like, it was, it was helpers cheat, I guess.


00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.280
Like it was so weird going from high school where they were like,


00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.040
use your graphical calculators.


00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.280
And then at university they said, no, don't use them.


00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.280
Um, and I remember thinking like after that, I barely even thought about it.


00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.200
I don't even use it in my everyday, like work or life anymore.


00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:50.200
When a lot of the things I do, I can just use Spotlight on my Mac to do a


00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.440
quick calculation or whatever, I'll do it in terminal or something like that.


00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:00.440
And then I saw this the other day, I was just amazed by it because I remember


00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.520
this graphical calculator showing you, you could get up graphs of, you know,


00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.160
like e to the X or sine X or cos X or something on your calculator, but the


00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:15.160
screen like was, it was like an old Game Boy or like a Nokia 3310, right?


00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.120
It was the most pixelated screen in the world.


00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.640
And making those graphs was so frustrating.


00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.640
Like it just wasn't intuitive.


00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.840
It wasn't fun, I didn't think.


00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:31.320
And then I saw this the other day where look at what like kids can use these days.


00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.240
They have this graphical calculator that has this, you know, proper, beautiful,


00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:43.400
actual color screen, and that you can use Python on to make plots and do calculations.


00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:49.440
And I just think this is such a fantastic idea because teaching kids to code early


00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.960
is so important. Like it can be used in so many different areas of work and life and


00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:02.040
science and everything like that. But I always find learning to code without a purpose necessarily


00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.760
is really difficult. Like just deciding one day, I'm going to learn how to code. Where


00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.880
do you start? Like, unless you've got a project, like what do you do? So the idea of learning


00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.080
as you're going through and actually learning the maths or learning the science with your


00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.040
graphical calculator is so good because then it just starts to come naturally to you. It's


00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.200
It's like the first thing you think of to do to solve a problem is to use Python.


00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:29.120
So I'm just so excited that this is a thing and I hope it becomes like the calculator


00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.920
that kids have to buy like if they're going to do math at like a higher level or something.


00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.280
Yeah, it's so cool.


00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:41.240
Instead of those weird programming languages that come, you know, like Polish notation,


00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.320
reverse Polish notation and stuff, like this is preparing them for proper programming.


00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.320
Exactly.


00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.760
Yeah, and I think that if you learn it in this way, it will just become so second nature


00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.820
that then it's not a barrier for you to go on and do anything else, right?


00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:00.760
It just becomes a tool that you can use to solve problems like in science or in, you


00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.120
know, sort of development or software development or something like that.


00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:11.840
As you get into university and wider world, like having that knowledge from that age is


00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.840
so good.


00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.840
I mean, I got mine at like 16.


00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.680
I don't know about if you guys remember when you got your graphical calculator,


00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.480
but I feel like at that age I was impressionable and it stuck with me.


00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.200
Exactly. Yeah, I think I might have gotten mine.


00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.400
That really was a decent one right when I got to college.


00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:34.160
But yeah, I had even had one of the TI-93s that had a full QWERTY keyboard on it for a while.


00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.760
It was that big one. Yeah, that was fancy when I was a TA in grad school.


00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.600
Yeah, that's the thing. I think I got them early because we specialize early in the UK.


00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.480
So like I was only doing maths and science by 16 and 8 like 16 to 18. So that's why I got mine earlier


00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:56.800
But yeah, like learning Python then would have been so helpful because I got to university and they were like, okay now time to learn


00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.120
Python, but let's do it while we learn general relativity


00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:05.240
Let's cut up some general relativity. I was like, oh, yeah, I'm still printing. Hello world


00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:12.660
So the fact you can learn it there here is so cool, how do you type into this thing though


00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.260
- Very slowly. - Like a calculator.


00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.580
- Very slowly, first of all.


00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.420
Yeah, I imagine it probably just has


00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.740
like an old phone keyboard, so three letters per number,


00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.620
but it might have one of the full QWERTYs


00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.100
like Michael was talking about.


00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.340
- I think it's the more skinny, tall ones,


00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.460
the more like an old phone.


00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.540
You know, it'd be awesome


00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.740
if you could transfer Python files over,


00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.140
but yeah, it has like a REPL and everything,


00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.380
which is pretty interesting.


00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.220
- I hope it'd have auto-complete.


00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.380
- Yes, oh. - That would be great.


00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.540
- Oh yeah, I hadn't even thought about that,


00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.460
but yes, it had better.


00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.100
So a couple of comments from the live stream,


00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.700
Marcel says, "Polish notations are opposite of method chain."


00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.060
Yeah, and Kim says, "Graphical calculators


00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.480
"would have been really handy in high school.


00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.980
"I never even seen one before.


00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.760
"Got into engineering, Python,


00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.660
"and reverse Polish notation, sounds tricky."


00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.220
Then Pamphil Roy from the SciPy world says,


00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.260
"Oh yeah, and Elsa told me you can't put things


00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.260
"like SciPy on there, sadly."


00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.020
But hopefully soon, maybe this is just,


00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.020
you know, V1.


00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.720
But yeah, I guess packages in general, right?


00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.640
They talk about having turtle and stuff,


00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.480
but you know, I'm not sure how much they have add-on.


00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.080
- But how cool would it be to have SciPy on there?


00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.940
Because then you could like plot a function


00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.980
and then you could like optimize


00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.540
and you could like find the solutions


00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.580
to a function that way.


00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.540
Probably skipping the differential equations


00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.740
that you're supposed to be learning in math.


00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.340
- Partial differential equations are easy.


00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.680
I just say like solve and give it the number.


00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.580
- Yeah, I would take your answers as I like.


00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.620
- I think Turtles is kind of neat on there also


00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.060
because I mean, I programmed a sub hunt


00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.780
on my single line reverse Polish notation,


00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.420
HP calculator just because I could sort of thing.


00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.700
So I think doing some games in there, kind of neat.


00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.220
- Yeah, yeah.


00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.580
People definitely agree with you about how cool that would be.


00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.380
- Yeah. - Awesome.


00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.980
All right, before we move on to the next one,


00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.160
let me tell you about our sponsor this week.


00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.100
So this episode of Python Bytes is brought to you by Sintri.


00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.620
I love Sintri, we use Sintri.


00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.420
So how would you like to remove a little stress


00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.260
from your life?


00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.540
Do you worry that users might be having difficulties


00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.460
or encountering errors with your app right now?


00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.380
Would you even know if they did until they send that email?


00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.140
How much better would it be to have error


00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.140
or performance details immediately sent to you,


00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.820
including call stacks, tracebacks,


00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.140
values of local variables,


00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.940
and even the logged in user that ran into the error.


00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.300
With Sentry, it's not just possible, but it's simple.


00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.660
We use Sentry, like I said, on all of our web apps,


00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.020
on Python Bytes and Talk Python, Talk Python Training courses.


00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.900
And I actually had somebody run into an error.


00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.580
I got a Sentry notification


00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.040
that this user had a problem doing this thing.


00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.140
I fixed it and sent them an email and they said,


00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.140
"Oh, that is incredible.


00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.040
"I was about to email you about this problem I had,


00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.760
"but it was late, so I was gonna do it tomorrow


00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.820
"and you already fixed it."


00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.120
So what a surprise.


00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.460
So surprise and delight your users today.


00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.380
Create your Sentry account at pythonbytes.fm/sentry.


00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.560
And when you sign up, please,


00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.240
there's a button that says, get a promo code.


00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.920
Make sure that you enter Python bytes,


00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.560
all caps, all one word in there,


00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.780
and you'll get the team plan,


00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.420
which gives you more features and more errors and so on.


00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.400
Not that you want more errors,


00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.560
but maybe more features is good.


00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.480
So pythonbytes.fm/sentry and promo code Python bytes.


00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.240
Brian, you got the next one.


00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:44.880
Okay, I got to say, though, that the artwork on that Git Sentry page was great.


00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.980
Yeah, it's very cool. Well done.


00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:52.680
So I've been trying to shift doing a little bit more work


00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.340
with GitHub Actions on my projects.


00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.840
But there's probably great documentation somewhere.


00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.440
I just don't know where it is.


00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.940
And I'm impatient, so I kind of want somebody to just say,


00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.380
"For Python, this is what you do."


00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.600
So there's a few of these walkthroughs, but I like this one that I just saw recently.


00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.640
This one's Python package, CICD with GitHub Actions.


00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.140
Just write what it says on the tin.


00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:25.240
But this is a nice walkthrough of some of the different things,


00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.900
and they're going through an example project, of course, but it's nice.


00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:35.240
The talks, first off, talks about


00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.820
kind of when you want actions to happen.


00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.220
So in talking about when they happen,


00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:46.500
this project happens on pull requests and on push to certain branches.


00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.160
So in this case, main branch,


00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.060
so you really can pick several branches that you could do this on


00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.900
and to have actions happen on those.


00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.740
I kind of like having a couple of different development branches,


00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.740
especially on things that I'm active on and don't want to release yet.


00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.300
So these are nice.


00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.500
And then what else?


00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.600
I'm going through a matrix of stuff.


00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.540
So most of the article is talking about syntax checking on different things.


00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.940
I don't know if really that's important,


00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:21.140
but I would probably do a Pytest on multiple matrices.


00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.640
So, but the matrix, the notion of a matrix is kind of interesting,


00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.640
the having the different environments.


00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:31.220
So in this case, this person is talking about


00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.620
maybe running on multiple versions of Python


00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.400
across Ubuntu, macOS and Windows.


00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.700
And that's exactly what I want.


00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.020
Those sorts of combinations


00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.260
to make sure something's working.


00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.660
- So with all the devices and stuff that you have,


00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.660
do you see this maybe as a network as well,


00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.060
like with all the hardware devices


00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.660
and the different ways it's configured?


00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.900
- Well, couldn't use GitHub actions,


00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.860
but we definitely use matrices


00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.100
to figure out which tests have to run on different configurations,


00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.800
different hardware, and it's just exploding.


00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.800
But yeah, that's a different nightmare.


00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.240
But this one is taken care of for you.


00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.200
So it's a neat thing to test across all those.


00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.220
And I knew how to do it on TOCs, I knew how to do it on Travis,


00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.680
and getting it to work and get have actions is just different.


00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.280
It's not harder, it's just different.


00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.160
So I appreciate this walkthrough.


00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.320
And then, what, going through running,


00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.360
example of running tests, of course,


00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.960
and checking artifacts, which is interesting.


00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.360
I hadn't thought about that.


00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.480
Your build might generate documents


00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.440
or other artifacts that you want to keep around.


00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.440
Having some checks around those is a good idea too.


00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.480
And then the last couple of bits,


00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.160
and really why I'm highlighting this


00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.980
is because I didn't really know how to do this,


00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.480
is doing auto-merges on some branches.


00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.220
So there's some branches that you,


00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.000
like maybe you're maintaining


00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.720
and nobody else has access to,


00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.560
but if you push to that, you want test to run


00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.600
and then automatically to merge to something


00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.660
and have it setting up auto merge.


00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.260
There's some steps around that,


00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.220
which is pretty darn cool.


00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.580
And the last bit is pushing to PyPI.


00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.760
So releasing-- - Oh, nice.


00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.440
- Release automation so you can automatically,


00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.660
in this case, setting up a rule


00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.340
so that if you push a tag that starts with a V,


00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.220
that means you've updated the version


00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.540
and you want that to push automatically out to PyPI.


00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.020
So hooking that up with GitHub Actions.


00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:35.860
- That's clever.


00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.300
I'd never thought about triggering it off of a tag name.


00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.100
I've always thought of it just certain branch means go,


00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.640
but yeah, that's clever.


00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.180
- Yeah, so that way you can even have like a main branch


00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.460
that has updated things,


00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.460
but it doesn't get pushed until there's a new version,


00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.660
which makes sense.


00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.060
- Yeah.


00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.700
Dr. Becky, what's the story with GitHub Actions


00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.460
and all of your colleagues, people use it?


00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.020
Oh, you're muted.


00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:09.300
- I had a drink and I spared you from hearing me gulp


00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.140
before, yeah, I don't even think I know what,


00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.700
I've used GitHub Actions to be quite honest.


00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.940
I'm sure some of my colleagues,


00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.380
I use GitHub all the time, obviously,


00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.820
but GitHub Actions,


00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.380
Try to remember. I don't think so


00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:28.580
Yeah, i'm sure somebody has them, but yeah, i'm sure some people maintain some of the packages and stuff


00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.780
That's what I was thinking. Yeah, I don't think I have anything like that


00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.900
um to maintain a lot of my colleagues put out stuff, but really my code is for sort of


00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.780
My use and for any specific colleague that has like a science case use for it


00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.220
um


00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:49.860
But github, I mean, I love github because one of the things I love doing with it is committing when i've written like a scientific paper


00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:56.900
I'll even put the latex on GitHub, what we sort of code our scientific writing in, right?


00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:03.700
And the PDF is included in your commits and then you can make a GIF from your commit history of


00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:08.020
like your PDF, like building up, like adding plots and all the words adding. It's one of my favorite


00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:13.380
things to do once I've finished because it feels like it's like, "Oh, I've done this project and


00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.500
And now I can like see it fully take form.


00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.460
And I remember I wrote my thesis,


00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.060
my entire PhD thesis in about two months


00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.140
because I got a job and I had to finish my PhD


00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.900
and I had to write it up.


00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.180
And I don't remember much from that whole two months time.


00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.220
It's a huge blur,


00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.700
except one vivid memory of the fire alarm going off


00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.500
in the department and being like,


00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.340
"Panic, git commit, git abolish."


00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.620
(laughing)


00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.760
Remember this I've got this one commit message in my thesis repo. That's basically just I just mullet the key


00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.380
It's just like the firewall is going on


00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.920
It commit anything


00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:57.400
Get pushed cuz I was like what if like what if I don't have a backup of like the past eight hours of writing


00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:02.460
I've just done it was a huge book and I was just like not losing this and people were like pulling me out of the


00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.460
room


00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.940
But yeah that reminds me of a sign I saw once yes


00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:18.380
Case of fire one get commit to get


00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.900
I


00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:27.140
Actually went through this but during a PhD thesis write-up, which I would never recommend to anybody


00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:33.580
I'm amazed that you found this image so fast. Oh, yeah


00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.800
I got you.


00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.640
A couple of comments from the live stream.


00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.440
Justin Boyce says, "Love being able to use GitHub Actions


00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.280
for deployment.


00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.880
Keeps me from botching deployment by making mistakes."


00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.720
I agree.


00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.720
Do it more often if it's automatic.


00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.300
And then Jared Chung says, "Looks great.


00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.600
Definitely going to hook this up to the packages I maintain,


00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.040
which change infrequently,


00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.840
so you don't have to remember the workflow and so on."


00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.140
And finally, Marcel Milsent says,


00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.680
"I heard GitHub is now offering free tier for institutions


00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.400
with unlimited contributors for private repos and $2,000,


00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.720
there are 2,000 actions a month for $0.


00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.240
So, yeah.


00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.280
- That goes alongside with the academics package as well,


00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.120
right, for students.


00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.240
It's not just students, it's also anybody with like a


00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.800
.edu email or .ac.uk, which is the universities over here.


00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.840
So I have like a, loads of free repos and stuff like that,


00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.680
which is great.


00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.280
I'm so good at that. - Oh, yeah, fantastic.


00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.120
Cool, cool.


00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.160
All right, moving on to number five.


00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.400
Not this one, this one.


00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.560
- Another spacey one.


00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.840
- Another spacey one.


00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.360
Garrett Dunn gave us a shout out saying,


00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.480
"SpaceX is now using Python for prototyping


00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.440
their Starlink satellite software."


00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.440
Which I don't know how you feel about Starlink, Dr. Becky.


00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.600
I mean, as an astronomer, it's like in your way,


00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.240
but as a way to empower people in remote places,


00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.760
it's kind of cool.


00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.280
- I'm really split about it to be honest,


00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.280
'cause I want it to go ahead.


00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.980
I think it's a really cool project, but I think there's more compromises need to be


00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:13.320
made in order for it to work in the way that it could, like the most efficiently the way


00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.320
that it could.


00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.200
And I know like even before this launched, I'd take an image and I'll end up with a satellite


00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.480
trail and at least one of 10 I've taken at a telescope that evening.


00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.000
And there's going to be more, right?


00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Exactly.


00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Yeah.


00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
And it's not like something you can remove.


00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
People are like, "Oh, just remove it as a source of noise."


00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.780
thing goes like right over your, you know, 15 minute exposure of a galaxy that's


00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.900
billions of light years away.


00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.000
And this massive bright thing just goes right over the middle.


00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.900
It ruins it, right?


00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.080
There's no rescuing that.


00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.060
So I do want it to go ahead.


00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.020
I do want it to work, but it's really cool that they're going to use Python.


00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.760
Like that could be something we could get warnings from, you know, like if it's


00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.860
something as accessible as Python, so to say something's going over, pause


00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.940
observation, carry on or something like that, you know?


00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.480
- Yeah, I would actually love to see SpaceX work


00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.480
more closely with all the satellite locations,


00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.880
observatories and say, all right,


00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.240
here's how we're gonna help you solve this problem.


00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.040
- Yeah, that would be great.


00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.640
- Yeah, diving into this.


00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.960
So Stack Overflow actually did a four part series


00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.760
on the software that SpaceX used


00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.400
to build all of their things in space.


00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.320
And this one in particular is about the network protocols.


00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:30.600
So if you look at how the Starlink system works,


00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.320
it turns out that most of the stuff is C++,


00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.640
both on the ground systems and the things in the sky.


00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.080
So they talk about that their software breaks


00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.960
into two parts, software that flies


00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.680
and software that supports the things that fly.


00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.280
So the software that flies is all C++


00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.280
that's on the embedded chips on the satellites.


00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.480
But then on the ground,


00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.120
there's a whole bunch of communication APIs


00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.960
and coordination APIs.


00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.200
If you look over at where these satellites are


00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.280
and where they're covering,


00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.000
there's these cool real-time maps.


00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.720
I'll put one on the screen here.


00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.640
You can actually see them flying by here


00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.360
where Brian and I are,


00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.520
at least I'll zoom in on that area.


00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.280
And you can see the overlap of the signals


00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.280
of the different ones and how they're oriented


00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.960
and all kinds of stuff.


00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.880
So they need to adjust and move these satellites around


00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.300
in orchestration and orchestrate them basically.


00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.440
So the software that does that,


00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.280
it's in production version in C++,


00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.800
but they do a lot of simulations and prototyping in Python


00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.800
to figure out how that works.


00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.400
'Cause, you know, think about the in-body problem,


00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.720
but for thousands or hundreds of thousands of these things


00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.120
to keep them all working together,


00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.840
the combinatorics of it get out of control really quick,


00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.800
they say.


00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.760
So there's a lot of simulations that need to be done


00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.760
and they do that in Python.


00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.800
And then once they get the working version,


00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.640
then they rewrite that in C++.


00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.560
What do you think?


00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.080
This is a cool picture, right?


00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.740
- Yeah, that's really cool.


00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.480
- Yeah, and speaking of GitHub Actions,


00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.280
they probably are actually using GitHub for this,


00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.860
but it doesn't explicitly say,


00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.240
but you think of organizations


00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.860
that have a hard time deploying their code,


00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.880
like you'll go to a website,


00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.760
like our website is down all of Sunday


00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.360
because we're deploying a new version.


00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.200
Like, are you kidding me?


00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.500
This is 2021.


00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.660
Like this should be Git push, wait a few seconds, and it's now the new version.


00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.700
Anyway, this is pretty interesting because they say the software is developed


00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:33.460
in a continuous integration environment with teams merging into the master development branch often


00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.100
and deploying to all the satellites weekly.


00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:43.460
That adds an extra level of panic to your Git push, doesn't it?


00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.060
It definitely does.


00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.260
Oh, whoops, I wasn't ready.


00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.140
All the satellites stopped responding.


00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:48.980
Whoops.


00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.860
So yeah, it says the Python version allows them


00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.820
to wrap for rapid iteration during the design phase.


00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.660
And once it's all happy, they write in C++.


00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.000
So yeah, anyway, pretty cool.


00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.980
I'll link to some of these maps that track it


00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.500
and the four-part series and so on.


00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.780
So Garrett, thank you for that.


00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.600
- It's really cool to see,


00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.100
'cause it's very similar to what Space Telescope


00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.580
are doing for the James Webb Space Telescope.


00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.620
Sorry, Space Telescope is the institution in Baltimore


00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.660
that manages like the Hubble Space Telescope


00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.660
and the new one that's gonna hopefully launch in October


00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.780
is called the James Webb Space Telescope.


00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.420
And I think that's a similar sort of platform


00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.780
in that a lot of the spacecraft sort of mechanics


00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.580
is done with sort of the usual comms that they have,


00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.220
possibly C++, but a lot of the tools they put together


00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.460
for astronomers who are planning observations,


00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.060
like where to point, how long that will take,


00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.140
and all those kinds of things when they're sort of deciding,


00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.580
I wanna use this to do this science,


00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.940
that's all been done in Python.


00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:49.300
like all of the sort of tutorials of like how to figure out how much like James Webb


00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.140
space telescope be able to see of this thing you want to look at is all done in like iPython


00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.140
notebooks.


00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.140
Do you buy it?


00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.820
I guess we should call them now.


00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.820
So it's really cool to see that like it's you know it's it's not just like these major


00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.940
academic institutions that are picking up Python because they know it's the academics


00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:08.320
that use that but it's companies like SpaceX as well I guess because they know their employees


00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.580
like work well with Python.


00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.440
- Oh, that's really cool.


00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.180
I knew a lot of the telescopes were using Python,


00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.820
but that's gonna be a massive new telescope.


00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.860
The James Webb telescope's gonna be a big deal, right?


00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.400
- Yeah, it's gonna be a huge deal.


00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.660
We've all got fingers crossed that launch actually happens


00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.180
'cause it was originally planned for 10 years ago


00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.180
and three years ago and five years ago.


00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.260
- Oh my gosh.


00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.660
Yeah, fingers crossed, I guess, for coming soon.


00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.780
All right, Dr. Becky, you got the next one.


00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:43.580
Yeah, so I feel like I've done the scientist thing of bringing a scientific


00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.740
paper to a Python podcast, but I'm bringing what I know.


00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:52.800
So I found this paper a while back when I was sort of doing the thing of like,


00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.860
you're an expert in something because you know what to Google.


00:37:54.860 --> 00:38:00.200
I was looking for something and I found this paper, the beginner's guide


00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.800
to working with astronomical data.


00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:07.140
And it's very much written as if you're a poor PhD student that's come in and


00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.500
your professor said, "Hey, here's a lot of data,


00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.340
please analyze it."


00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.660
And you're like, "I don't know where to start."


00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.380
So that's kind of who it's written for.


00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.940
And I think if you are a really keen amateur astronomer,


00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.540
and I know a lot of people do want to get into


00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.380
astrophotography and possibly did during the pandemic


00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.940
with lockdowns and stay at home orders,


00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.820
and perhaps might have set up something


00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.020
with like a Raspberry Pi, you know,


00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.300
to control a telescope, to know where it's pointing,


00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:38.060
something like that, or even to adapt it with a camera as well.


00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:44.120
And then they have all these images that they then want to remove noise and get


00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:48.200
like a beautiful color image of something as well, and they're not entirely sure


00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.100
how to do it, but they might know Python.


00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.400
I use Python to, you know, analyze the images that come off the


00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.800
back of professional telescopes.


00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.180
So you could do it with amateur telescopes or amateur camera, you know,


00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:03.000
just an SLR camera you've set up in your back garden to take an image of something.


00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.200
But you want to see fainter and fainter things.


00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.640
You have to take lots and lots of like short images so you don't get, you know,


00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:13.280
motion blur and stuff like that with the, with actually the rotation of the earth.


00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.120
But they're all the wrong coordinates.


00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:15.920
So what do you do?


00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.000
So because they're not all in the same place, so you use astropy to figure out,


00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.200
you know, how to do this.


00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.360
Does it like realign the images to adjust for that rotation?


00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.200
Exactly.


00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:24.640
Yeah, yeah.


00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.320
It can do that.


00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.600
And so, but there's obviously lots of other steps that you need to do,


00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.880
like taking out noise.


00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.420
So this actually talks through like all of the steps that would go


00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.140
into what a professional would do.


00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.900
And I reading it, I think it's so well-written that I think someone who is


00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.920
a really keen amateur and who wants to get into astrophotography and do the.


00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.460
You know, reduction of, as we call it, of the images, you know, make them


00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:54.460
look extra pretty by the end of it with Python, because they're a keen Python person.


00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.700
I think this would be the thing to be like, right, I'm going


00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.860
to make this my bedtime reading.


00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:03.820
It's very, very long, but I think you could definitely make this like a project


00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.380
if someone was keen enough to do.


00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.700
And so that's why I thought I'd, I'd bring it.


00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:12.780
And I feel like obviously we need a huge shout out to AstroPy and Map.lib


00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:16.180
and everything like that for making these kinds of things possible with, you know,


00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.460
images that you can take in your back garden and, and, and stuff that you can


00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.420
get at, but you know, this, you know, someone in a, in a month or so, they're


00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.020
really keen on Python and they're really keen on taking photos of the night sky.


00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.400
You could be getting images of galaxies and nebula that look amazing, you know?


00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.840
So that's why I thought I'd bring it out.


00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.280
Yeah.


00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.980
Print it out and put it up as artwork in your house or something.


00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:37.920
That'd be fantastic.


00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.200
Instead of just saying, that's a, that's a cool picture of a galaxy.


00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.720
Like I took that picture of that galaxy.


00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.520
That's totally different.


00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.580
Exactly.


00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:44.720
Yeah.


00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.440
You know, I can imagine someone getting an amazing picture of Andromeda, you


00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:52.120
know, and following these steps that it outlies, and I think it's easier because,


00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:57.240
especially if you know Python, there's no learning curve with a new tool or a


00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:02.440
new or like frustration with a GUI right that's just this like interface what's going on I don't


00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:07.400
have to use it because it's just pure Python I think it if you already know Python it's definitely


00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:12.120
the easiest way to get into this because it'll be something familiar with with something new


00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:19.960
so even though it's a scientific paper it would get would pass so yeah it looks super interesting


00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.960
the code doesn't look terribly challenging but you know it's exactly what you need to solve the


00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.960
the problems, right?


00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.280
- Exactly, yeah.


00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.920
- Cool, cool.


00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.720
All right.


00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.120
I think that's it for our six items.


00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.020
Brian, you got anything?


00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.200
- No, I just apologize to the stream people.


00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.000
For some reason, my video stream is frozen.


00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.360
- I think that you might just be really, really zen


00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.680
and still.


00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.720
- I thought he was just really interested in the paper,


00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.160
but he was like, wow, look at that.


00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.720
- You've mesmerized him, absolutely.


00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.640
All right, so before we move on, actually,


00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.520
Justin Boyd says, "Thanks for bringing this, Dr. Becky.


00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.560
"I did pick up astrophotography barely as a hobby


00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.160
"during the pandemic and it looks good."


00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.160
So yeah, already, I already got one person into it.


00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.200
- Taking that like biggest step to go from like,


00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.720
"Oh, cool, I managed to photograph some stars,"


00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.420
to getting like the galaxy's nebula.


00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.160
I think this will help people take that step, I think so.


00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.720
- Yeah, for sure.


00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.720
- I'm glad it helped.


00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.960
- All right, I got a couple of quick shout outs at the end.


00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.940
First, I want to point out that if you like this conversation,


00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:29.000
check out episode 303 of Talk Python,


00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.160
where Dr. Becky and I dive all into the Python astronomy


00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:33.660
world.


00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.000
That was fun.


00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.120
And then I just met with one of the founders of this company


00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.800
called Kubuntu Focus, which I thought


00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.200
was a pretty interesting idea.


00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:49.800
So what they're going for is the way that Apple works.


00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.400
They make the Mac and then they make macOS


00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.680
and that tight integration of those two things


00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.280
works better than just bringing pieces together


00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.760
and building your own sort of thing, right?


00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.000
So that's sort of the same idea, but for Linux.


00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.240
And so it's really focused on people who do AI type of work


00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.260
or just wanna have a really good desktop Linux environment.


00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.320
So for example, down here at the bottom,


00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.180
keeping it in the space world,


00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.560
we have Chris Mattman, who if I refresh it,


00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.920
it'll come up at the right time maybe,


00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:19.760
and it's supposed to cycle.


00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.600
Anyway, Chris Mattman said he, who works at JPL,


00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.720
who he did some machine learning training


00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.120
on his MacBook Pro and it took like 37 hours.


00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.440
And on this thing, because they have these crazy GPUs,


00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.840
these like GeForce 3080s and stuff in the laptop,


00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.200
they did it in like an hour and a half


00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.880
instead of 37 hours or whatever it was.


00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.180
So, and by the way, you can actually buy it.


00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.080
Like these new GeForce chips are cards.


00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.300
They're basically unobtainium, right?


00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.400
You can't get to them.


00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.760
So yeah, anyway, pretty, pretty interesting.


00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.180
If you're looking for a desktop Linux world, check that out.


00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:01.200
Dr. Becky, anything you would like to give a shout out to?


00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.880
Maybe I could throw out your Amazon page.


00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.400
Anything else? - Yeah, sure.


00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.400
- Yeah.


00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.380
- Yeah, so I've written a book.


00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.520
So it's got different names everywhere in the world,


00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.600
just to confuse everybody.


00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.240
So in the US and Canada,


00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.040
It's called Space at the Speed of Light in the UK and pretty much


00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.020
everywhere else in the world.


00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.480
It's Space 10 Things You Should Know.


00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.200
And then there's also the German edition as well, which I'll not explain.


00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.360
Das kleine Buch von Großen Knall.


00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.360
Großen Knall.


00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.160
Yeah, exactly.


00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.120
It's a good book title.


00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:35.360
Um, it's, it's essentially, it's written for, I think anyone who is a


00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.160
complete beginner in space, but has always maybe been a bit, a bit


00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.000
curious would love this book.


00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.920
It's, it's like the 10 things that if you were going to be at a dinner party


00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.120
you'd be like, "Hey, did you know this?"


00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.520
Like, these are the things you should know about space, right?


00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:53.520
But I also think that anybody who's been keen on space as well,


00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.840
will also get a kick out of it.


00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.400
Um, because it takes ideas that you might've heard before, but then


00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:03.640
just adds an intellectual level, of like where we are right now on the


00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.920
edge of like our understanding of this thing.


00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.880
So, it's a really short read as well.


00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.000
Um, it's not heavy, it's not a big hefty thing.


00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
It's really skinny.


00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.600
My laptop's currently propped on top of it, otherwise I would show you how skinny it is.


00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.600
I've disrupted everything.


00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.440
So, yeah, if people want to check that out, please do.


00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:29.480
Or if you have, I don't know, an uncle or an aunt or a nephew or a niece or whatever that you think would like that.


00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.480
I've been told it's a good gift.


00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.480
So...


00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.480
Rahen asks, "Is it really big?" Nope, it's not that big.


00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.480
It's about 200 pages.


00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.480
Yeah, Proudman says, "I can vouch for the book." Yeah, absolutely.


00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.320
- Thank you, Bevan.


00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.480
- And then it also says that Brian imported Zen.


00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.440
(laughing)


00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.880
- I've got a close friend that has a telescope


00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.000
and he always wants to talk about space and I know nothing.


00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.640
So I'm definitely gonna read this book


00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.200
so I can talk to him.


00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.560
- There you go, yeah.


00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.140
Perfect for that.


00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:05.640
- All right, I have, we always close out the show


00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.080
with a joke, but I went and found some space memes


00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.320
'cause Dr. Becky is here.


00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.120
And you've done a couple of videos


00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.600
on reacting to space memes.


00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.240
And so I thought maybe some space memes


00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.000
would be appropriate as our jokes for the week.


00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.160
- Yeah, they're so fun because people click on them


00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.680
and they're like, I just learned more


00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.280
in this 15 minute video about space memes


00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.720
than I did in my entire high school career in physics.


00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.880
And I'm like, that was always my intention.


00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.720
Wow.


00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.640
(laughing)


00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.080
I draw you in with the memes


00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.880
and then I hit you with the science.


00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.320
- Exactly, exactly.


00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.140
It's so good.


00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.760
Yeah, so maybe we can link to some


00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.600
of the proper ones you've done there's a lot.


00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.360
So I'm gonna throw out four quick little space memes.


00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.360
I think four is it.


00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.560
So I gotta remember what the names,


00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.760
I gave them each a title.


00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.080
So the first one is Uber.


00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.000
So there's Matt Damon sitting on ours alone.


00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.320
Remember he gets abandoned there and he says,


00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.160
"Where's my Uber?"


00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.360
And then there's the Elon Musk roastery shot in his face.


00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.600
I'll be there in a minute.


00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.840
(laughing)


00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:08.720
- I mean, I don't know whose definition of minute that is.


00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:14.960
Seriously, why did they launch a Tesla into space?


00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.560
Every time I'm reminded that they did this, I'm like, but why?


00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.560
I know.


00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.560
But why?


00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.560
There's no reason.


00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.560
Because they could.


00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:29.360
I think that was, just because they could, they never stopped to think whether they should.


00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.360
Yeah.


00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.240
Well, it's the same company that is rocking Dogecoin.


00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.240
So you know.


00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.240
All right.


00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.240
Next one.


00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:41.240
This one called "Flaws, Spaceship Design."


00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.920
Here's a picture of a spaceship with a cutout


00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.760
so you can see inside.


00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.120
It says, "When building a spaceship,


00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.880
the tiniest details are crucial.


00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.720
For example, this spaceship may be flawed


00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.720
because it has a giant hole in the side."


00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.380
(both laughing)


00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:58.880
- I love Brian's squeak laughing.


00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.880
That's the level he's reaching.


00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.320
- That's awesome.


00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.320
And yet he's still very still in this.


00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:12.480
I do love these like they're like a hybrid between a really scientific diagram and then


00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:16.640
something you would put out to the public or use in a talk or something like that and


00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:23.680
I remember the ELT, the extremely large telescope that we're building which I know is a stupid


00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:31.360
name, they used emperor penguins for scale next to it in like the public image.


00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.360
I was like, who knows how big an emperor penguin is?


00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.160
Is that like a knee height? Is that a waist? What are we talking here?


00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:42.160
Apparently it's because on average an emperor penguin is a meter high.


00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.680
So they were like, oh, it's a meter. It's like a meter rule.


00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.640
And I was like, yeah, but nobody knows that. Like just put a human.


00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:54.000
Dean links them out there in the live stream says, boy,


00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.440
the mileage on that Tesla would make it really hard to resell. I agree.


00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.640
All right, the next one is distracted. There's a cat in a space suit


00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.720
It says mesmerized by the red dot on the wall missed space launch


00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:15.520
I'm now wondering if there's been any like cat astronauts in in previous. There's been dog astronauts


00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.560
monkey astronauts, but


00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.880
I don't know if we've ever sent a cat to space


00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.440
I propose a new


00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.760
Thing like maybe a cat could spend some time on the international space station. Just


00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.960
Think of all the memes and all the funny videos.


00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.960
I don't think it would have a good time.


00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:40.000
It constantly tries to have its hackles raised, but it can't because it's in zero G.


00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.960
It just goes in a small circle really slowly.


00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:49.840
Yeah, maybe, you know how there's those videos online where they put cellotape on the back of


00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.880
a cat and it constantly crouches to go under something that's not there? Maybe it would


00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:00.960
do something like that. I don't know, I'm really intrigued now. A cat in zero-g, what would it do?


00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.040
Benfield says, "Congo tried to send a rat."


00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:10.320
Once they've sent a rat, they're going to need a cat to solve the rat in space problem.


00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:16.560
And they said, also, Justin says, "Space toys are hard. Space litter boxes are nearly impossible."


00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.720
And Sam Worley is like, "You really think they could get a cat to go into a space rocket?"


00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:28.080
The minute they open the door of the space rocket, the cat will just dart onto the bed,


00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.360
but you can't get it. Like, when you take it, it's the vet.


00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:35.520
All right, let's round it out. The last one, space Vegas.


00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:40.720
There's a black hole. What happens in a black hole stays in a black hole.


00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.520
Nice. Space Vegas. I like it.


00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.920
That's right. Yeah. I know we talked about this one before, but it made it in a second time.


00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.840
I guess instead of sin city would it be like spin city?


00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:57.520
Because spin city yeah I don't know spin city yeah maybe something like that.


00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.120
Things rotate as they go into the black hole right they don't just go straight do they?


00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.880
Yeah yeah it's actually really really hard to grow a black hole and make stuff fall in


00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.000
which everyone's always really surprised at because they think they're like hoovers


00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.480
but most stuff just orbits them like the earth orbits the sun it's just a kind of a heavier


00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:17.600
sun that we can't see right so most stuff orbits it doesn't fall in and it takes a lot of effort


00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:26.640
to make stuff fall in. So nice. Well, once it's in, it stays there. Yeah. Fantastic. All right.


00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.480
Well, Dr. Becky, thanks for being here. It was really great to have you and Brian.


00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:37.280
Thanks. Good to be with you. Yeah, you bet. Bye everyone.
