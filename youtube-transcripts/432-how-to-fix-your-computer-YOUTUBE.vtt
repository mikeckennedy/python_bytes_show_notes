00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:01.960
Hey, Brian. Hey, world.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:02.720
Hey.

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:07.820
Let's do it. We've got some fun things to share.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.060
And we're ready. So, here we go.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:23.440
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds. This is episode 432, recorded May 19, 2025. I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.840
And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:44.220
And this episode is brought to you by NordLayer, awesome bolt-on security that you can add to all of your dev stations and servers and so on. I'm going to tell you more about that later. If you like social media things, you can stay up on a lot of announcements and follow the show. Follow us.

And our email list is getting better and better, so be sure to sign up as the friend of the show. You'll get cool summaries and extra information to get more out of the episode. Like before, as in pre, not after, Brian.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.400
Yeah, as in pre.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.960
Like pre-commit.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:03:35.460
so I'd like to cover an article that from Adam Johnson pre-commit install with uv and it's just a short little short little tip but I didn't know you could do this so so pre-commit normally I've installed it before but I can't really remember how to and Adam brings up that the install guide is maybe not the friendliest particular for developers who don't use python but also anyway uh hmm i guess pre-comm is used for other stuff too right so uh but you can use uv so that's really the article talking about a couple things not only just use uv so you can use uv by saying uv tool install pre-commit and now you have pre-commit installed for all of your projects in one place and uh and then but uh the recommendation also is to use with pre-commit uv. So this extra thing is this with you is pre-commit uv. It says use uv to create virtual environments and install packages for pre-commit. And also comments that why would you do this? Because it speeds up the initial install. And so the initial thing. And so if you've got it loaded on your local computer, apparently the first run of pre-commit with all of your extras it'll probably be a little bit slower than later because there's a pre-commit cache that goes on but for instance if you're doing like docker images in your ci system there might not be a cache there but uh so the um and i might be just talking smoke because there might be a way to get around it with uh with containers anyway however if you really want that first initial one to be a little bit faster anyway so using uv might be a good answer so anyway also so that's not that's actually not why david or david adam uh recommends this yeah he recommends it just because it's an easier install and it sure is you just say the other thing is you don't even need python installed for that to work that's true yep

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.660
but

00:03:36.660 --> 00:04:08.560
uh uv tool uv tool install pre-commit with pre-commit uv and then you've just got pre-commit working. And yeah, you don't even need Python already installed. The uv packaging manager and all that stuff and caching will just work. And I kind of love it. I've been using uv tool for a lot of stuff lately. It's pretty slick. So yeah, I just tried this out this morning. Worked like a charm. Love it. Yeah, that's super neat. And yeah,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.920
UV all the way. I or directly related to uv as well for the week.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.500
So let's get to it.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.360
The next thing that I have is kind of like that, but it's not uv.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.280
Oh, hold on.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.900
Hold that thought.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.580
Here we go.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:47.180
So this thing is PEP773 has been accepted by, it's created by Steve Dower, who does a lot of the Windows plus Python work, core developer, but also works at Microsoft. So it is a Python installation manager for Windows.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:06:02.260
So it's, maybe I'm not quite getting it right when I describe it this way, but to me it feels very much like an official Windows-based UV-like thing, at least for managing the Python side of stuff, okay? So it's put there as a one manager to rule them all, PyManager. So it goes under the name of PyManager, but I believe its official name is something like the Python Manager for Windows type of thing, something like that. And the idea is there's right now multiple ways to get Python onto your computer, and they're unrelated and different. So I could go to python.org and download it, and that would give me a PY launcher that I can run and do things. Or I could go to the Windows Store and install it that way, which is another thing. Or I could use Winget or I could use NuGet to install it. It's like, okay, great. What do I do? Right? So the idea here is that this is one thing that does all the stuff that those do. You don't have to think about it. You can get it those different ways. So if somebody told you to go to the Windows Store and get Python, you would get PyManager as an MSIX, which is the installer

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.420
runtime

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:55.940
for Windows. It's like the installer. It's for Mac. So you would get that there, or you could go to python.org and download it, and you would get the same thing and the other ways you get it. So it's kind of a similar way to get Python that's consistent across all of them. And what's cool about it is it's super easy to use. So if you just type the word Python, it will launch the best, in quotes, the best Python runtime that either is already there, or like here's where the uv stuff comes in, or it'll auto install the latest version of CPython if it's not there. So at first, it's kind of like a shell of Python, and they used to have that, and I think it said something like, I don't know if you remember this, but in Windows, in the early days, it used to say, you don't have Python. Go install Python.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:11.880
If you type the word Python, you're like, great. Could you help me out or just, okay, I'll just go do that, I guess. So what this one now does, it says, okay, great. Like uv virtual environment or uv tool, if you don't have Python, it just says, great, we'll get the latest one and we'll run that.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.240
So that's pretty cool.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:24.060
I thought there was for a while there was like, if you type Python it'll like open a window to say, hey, do you want to install this? And if you said okay, it would take you to the store or something like that. Yeah, maybe

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.440
that's right. It would take you to the store, wouldn't it? Yeah.

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:27.740
Yeah,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.140
there were some funky ways.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:47.260
So it has I believe py is still there but it's going to have the same subcommands as well and so on so like install, uninstall, list, run and one thing that's kind of nice is you can also get Python 3 commands in Windows if you

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.420
just add something

00:07:48.420 --> 00:08:14.160
to your path because traditionally I believe it's been a while since I've played with it like in real detail but I think it used to be you had to type Python only like only Python to work and Python 3 didn't work on Windows but on Mac and Linux only Python 3 worked not Python by default you know what I mean it's like why are they different and so this also brings a little bit of unifying there

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.140
okay just in time for nobody to use Python 2

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:48.060
yes exactly yes okay yeah maybe they're like well at least we should be consistent but I'm here for it like I'd be fine to cancel Python 3 as a command. Just go, you have to say Python 2 if you want Python 2. Don't make the thing you should be doing harder than the thing you shouldn't be doing. Anyway, this should be mainstream by Python 3.15, and the traditional installers will disappear in 3.16, like 2027.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.600
So it's not a huge change right away, but I believe, you know, what does it say?

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.220
I believe it says to the top.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.340
This is just a standard, right?

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.420
It's not one of those things that's in a version of Python.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.880
So soon, soon, soon.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.080
Yeah.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.440
Two years.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.400
Be here before you know it.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.760
Yes, it absolutely will.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.400
Before

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.120
we move on, yeah.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.340
Yeah, I'd like to thank

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.580

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.800
Thank you to Nordlayer for sponsoring Python Bytes.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.040
Indeed,

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.360
indeed.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.940
Now, oh, I'm up next.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:20.200
So this one, this news broke last week, but like I said, we weren't recording last week, so I'm going to announce it this week.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:35.820
Maybe you've heard it by now, but unfortunately, it's very sad to me to hear this, but unfortunately, Textualize, the company behind Rich and Textual, founded by Will McGugan, is shutting down.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:43.300
So, you know, it's better to try something and fail than not try at all, right?

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:51.820
So some of the quotes from Will's post announcing this is, bittersweet news, the business experiment ends, but the code lives on.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.400
Obviously, it's super popular, right?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.980
And if we go to GitHub somewhere, what are we looking at for stars?

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.680
Yeah, 28,000 stars, super, super popular.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:47.960
but as a business it's no longer a thing so will says it began as a hobby project layered on top of rich but it grew into something that looked impossible to do with terminals and yet somehow it doesn't so despite the success the team couldn't pinpoint a single pain point big enough to sustain a business model so the company is winding down probably about now said in a couple weeks but that was a few weeks ago. Projects themselves aren't going anywhere. They're stable, battle tested, and will continue. So I want to say thank you to Will and everyone on the team for this. It's a big contribution to the community. And let's see here. Let's see.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:57.460
Oh, I don't even see a sponsor. A sponsor option. Will, put a sponsor option for us here.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.920
So we can recommend people go and sponsor the projects.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:01.220
Yeah.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:01.620
Yeah.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.720
At a minimum, help them keep it going strong.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:12.120
No, I love what Will has done with Rich and Textual, and we're all rooting for Textualize.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:22.560
And I don't, I mean, yeah, it's not going to stay a company anymore, but I think having it be a company while it was made Textual into something, like, super cool.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.860
They were able to focus on it and make it awesome.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.940
So I appreciate everybody's work on that.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:28.820
Yeah,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:29.300
absolutely.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.800
A hundred percent.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.580
All right.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.320
Well, let's see.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.700
I'd like to, I heard about this a few weeks ago, actually.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.620
I think also this, here's an article, let's see, updated in April.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.380
So yeah, month ago.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.540
It's an article by, I had the name, Matthias Endler.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.600
The best programmers I know.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.120
and it's an interesting idea for an article.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.940
He was just saying, I have met a lot of developers in my life.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.740
Lately, I've asked myself, what does it take to be one of the best?

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.140
What do they all have in common?

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.760
And I kind of love this and I like the list.

00:14:09.319 --> 00:14:11.200
I encourage you to go and read this article.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:17.200
We've got a link in the show notes, but I'm going to jump around and read some of the topics.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.000
So read the reference.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.320
If there's one thing that I should have done as a young programmer, it would have been read the reference.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:31.820
And like the Python standard library, I admit I have not read all of the standard library, Tommel spec, things like that.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:41.960
I would add to this that if you're going to do something new, jump down into beginner mode and just read a beginner reference on something.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:53.480
Even if you're an expert Flask developer and you want to switch to FastAPI, go ahead and read the beginning tutorial and walk through the beginning tutorial for FastAPI.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.140
Things like that are helpful.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.260
All right, I'll go a little faster.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.920
The topics, so read the reference, know your tools really well, read the error message.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.680
Getting good at reading error messages is totally a good skill.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.920
Breakdown problems, don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.040
Always help others, right?

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.240
So blogging, talks, open source, those help you get better.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.760
Never stop learning.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.500
Status doesn't matter.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.580
Build a reputation.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.560
Have patience.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.280
Never blame the computer.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.980
Don't be afraid to say, I don't know.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:30.900
Very important.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.560
Don't BS to people.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.020
That's AI's job.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.900
If somebody comes to you, give them what you know.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.060
Don't guess.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.520
Keep it simple.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.100
Simple.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.700
And that's it.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.460
But really great commentary on each of these.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.340
I love having this all put together as some good advice for software developers.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.800
It's easy to forget, right?

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.500
It's also easy to not really know and just wondering, how are they so productive?

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.600
How do they know how that is implemented or how that works internally in Python?

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.340
Like, well, they read it.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:06.340
You know what I mean?

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.320
The status one is important, I think.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.800
Don't assume that if you're just because you're...

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:24.700
I mean, there's so much complicated stuff in software that it really doesn't take long of focusing on something to become really one of the better people that understand how to use something,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.820
especially

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.720
within your company.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:32.360
So even if you're a junior developer, you might be the expert in Tool X or something like that.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:41.740
And if you've got a company that's okay with it, and hopefully you do, that's okay with people getting advice from all layers, run with that.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.280
So, yeah, some great advice.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.340
Yeah, definitely.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.420
All right.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.160
Well, that's it for our main item, Brian.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.560
So let's talk about a little bit of security.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.180
Okay.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:17:05.720
So how do you access your server if you're running in the cloud, in some sort of hosting, maybe even a home lab that you somehow, for some reason, have it accessible to the internet, things like that?

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.400
SSH, right?

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:08.720
That's almost universally.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.959
Sometimes with Windows, you might be doing a remote desktop, but probably SSH, yeah?

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:14.560
Yeah.

00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:17.800
I'd say at least 80% of the stuff out there is managed that way.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.480
Yeah, look at this little quick answer.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.040
How many SSH attacks can a public Linux server expect per second?

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:28.680
Two.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.520
Two attacks per second.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.760
That's crazy.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.160
No, sorry.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.540
I multiplied it all.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:37.220
Every two.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.560
Every two seconds.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.080
So that's like 30,000 attempts to hack your SSH.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.460
And the reason why do I bring this up?

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.080
This is one of my extras.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.220
I've been listening to some security podcasts lately, and they're like, oh, my gosh.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.380
There's like people are coming up with all these crazy schemes to try to block their SSH.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:05.460
Like, well, I know that I have like my business and my local house IP addresses are pretty stable.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.380
They're not static, but they're pretty stable.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:10.460
So I'm going to just set up a rule to only allow access from those two.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:12.640
You know?

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.140
What if the power goes out and the thing resets around?

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.640
That's super dangerous.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.540
You might never, ever get back to there.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:43.280
Other advice is, well, go into the server and just shut it off, but then use some admin tool, like an admin console, or maybe even go in and just turn off the thing.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:48.300
So anyway, I have a much better suggestion, I think, for folks.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.340
Almost everybody's hosting comes with what's called a cloud firewall.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:03.220
You just log in from anywhere in the world using your 2FA, and you have access to the dashboard for your cloud setup, right?

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.180
There's console.aws.com.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.620
There's console.hetzner.com and so on.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:19.500
And so just go in there and put your, you can just restrict access to your SSH to your current IP address.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:28.020
And if for some reason your IP address changes or you're in a coffee shop and you want to get access, just log in real quick and enter that IP address.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.780
Chances are if you go back to that coffee shop again, it's still got the same IP address.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:32.800
You only got to do it once.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.220
It's super low effort.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:41.360
And your tax go from $30,000 a day to zero because those are coming from all over the world.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.620
They're not coming from within the house, right?

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.060
They're not coming from your machine.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:46.860
It

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.860
would be too late, right?

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.660
It's just to prevent the public stuff.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.720
So embrace cloud firewalls, folks.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.760
That's all I want to say.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:53.560
Okay.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:54.240
Cool.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:54.480
Okay.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:55.660
Next.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.060
This was last week, right?

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:04.360
But caveat is where I said Python beta 1 is here, 314 beta 1.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.340
It is time for some beta pie.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.000
Mmm, tasty.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.080
So, Python 3.41, come on.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.980
So, people can check this out.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.180
This is the preview of the first stable version.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.960
I guess it really is just the first stable version of Python 3.14, which is cool.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.100
So, check it out.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:25.960
Can't believe we're

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.560
already here again.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:27.900
Yeah, I know.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:28.960
Here we are.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:36.620
I also want to say there's a new batch of Python Software Foundation fellows.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.980
And I think there's like 10 folks or so in here.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.640
Charlie Marsh.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.760
Charlie Marsh.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:42.360
Yay.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.560
Obviously, like he's been doing such a quick

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:44.740
while.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:45.840
Yeah.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.280
A lot of cool folks.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.740
Ivy, Fung, and other folks.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.180
I don't want to read off everyone's name, but congrats to everyone in there.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.140
That's super cool.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:54.780
Nice.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.480
Not super cool.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.240
Post from Mike Dropbooms.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:07.900
Speaking on behalf or for many, many people here, he is, but it says, I'll just read you a little bit of it, Brian.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.340
It's been a tough couple of days.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:18.180
Microsoft's support for the Faster CPython project has been canceled yesterday as of four days ago.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.360
My heart goes out to the majority of the team who was laid off.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.860
I mean, that's actually a lot of people.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.360
If you look at the picture, presuming that all those people there are on the faster CPython team.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.480
I'm not entirely sure they are.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.160
But I know that included Guido, Mike, some other folks.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.320
It's not great, right?

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.220
I can't remember where I read it.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:55.040
There's some conversations, but someone said, look, it's pretty short-sighted to bet the company on AI as Microsoft is and at the same time fire the team making the dominant language.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.540
for that technology better.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.140
You know, you got to

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:07.720
maximize shareholder value, Brian, but like, I don't know, 10 people or something, how big of a deal is that on the scale of Microsoft?

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.060
Exactly.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.720
So that's that.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:19.220
And then also Brett Cannon says there were layoffs yesterday and three Python core devs from the FasterCpython team were caught in them.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:25.920
If you know any jobs, please send them their way to help them keep going strong.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.380
You know what I mean?

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.520
So I look to that as well.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.220
These are some insane people.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.580
You really can't find something else for these people to work on.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:34.700
Yeah, exactly.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:35.400
Exactly.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:37.460
All right.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.180
Back to better news.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:50.820
So I just released, as in during this episode, push the go public button for something that was formerly known as Red Knot but is now known as ty.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:23:06.040
This is Astral's new type checker equivalent of mypy, but also maybe even more important than that is a runtime language server that handles very large code bases and is more lenient than PyLance and others.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.340
Oh, interesting.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:27.820
Another thing that's super interesting, the VS Code team, I don't think unreasonably, but I think they're starting to crack down on allowing a lot of these forks of VS Code access to some of the underlying infrastructure that are extensions, right?

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:40.000
Like, for example, PyLance, the runtime things, other tooling, a lot of the extensions that Microsoft makes aren't available to, say, Cursor or Windsurf or the 150,000 other free ones.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:46.400
So this might be an even better high-performance replacement of things like the language server for the

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.440
Vibe

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.340
Coding platform as well.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:54.880
Anyway, it's a super cool interview with Carl Meyer and Charlie Marsh, and people should check that out.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.120
That's nice.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.580
So what's TY?

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.800
Is that just because it's easy to type?

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:01.860
Does it type?

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.820
I think it's for type.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:03.360
Type.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:03.920
Yeah.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.400
I think of it as like thank you.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:05.940
Thank you.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:06.600
Yeah.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.440
We made a lot of jokes about that during the show.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.360
Everyone says thank you to the astral folks for making it better every time they run it.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:15.340
Yeah.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.800
Yeah, so that episode is literally hot off the presses.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.380
Check it out.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:19.600
Cool.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.060
Can't wait.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:33.600
and something I've been doing that's pretty fun, Brian, is I've been doing, I'm working on making a bunch of shorts like TikToks and YouTube shorts and stuff from the Talk Python episodes.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.020
So I'm going to play a 15-second video.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.000
I think people are going to enjoy this.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.320
This is not exactly the joke, but it's kind of like the joke.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:41.720
Are you ready?

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:42.360
Yeah.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.700
Yeah, I guess if you use Postgres, you could just put it in a JSON field as well, something like

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:46.780
that.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.120
Oh, yeah.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.260
We call that mullet schema, right?

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:56.080
It's business up front and partying back where the last column on your table is a JSON field.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.200
I've never heard that.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:57.900
That's incredible.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:58.960
It's like, yeah,

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.860
we look real formal, but don't look back there.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.980
Got it in a ponytail today.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:05.780
Yeah.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.160
Amazing.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:07.880
Isn't that amazing?

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:08.520
Yeah.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:08.760
Anyway,

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.700
so people should check out the channel, obviously.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.040
I'm doing some fun stuff there.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:14.700
All right.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:14.960
That's

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.520
it for my extras.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.420
Maybe let me check.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.260
Yes, that's it for my extras.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.520
So I just got the joke left.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:22.340
How about your extras, Andy?

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:23.800
Just a quick one.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.240
I wanted to pull up a screen.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.480
Let's see.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.480
Picture of Munich.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:37.920
I just wanted to mention the reason why we mentioned this at the beginning of the show, but the reason why we didn't do it last week is I was in Munich, but I had a great time.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:38.740
It was a work trip.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:46.480
I was there to perform a talk or present a talk at an internal conference.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:53.000
And the reason why I'm bringing this up is not just to humble brag that I was in Munich, but yeah, it was fun.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.200
Anyway, it was that I think it's just a really cool idea.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:09.200
I was there for an internal company conference, and I think this is an awesome idea just to allow – we didn't have everybody over there, but everybody could submit talks, and if you got your talk accepted, you go, of course.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:16.460
But it was like a two-day event with like three or four tracks.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.740
and just like a normal conference.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.940
We had talks and everything.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:20.980
It was great.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.120
Everybody self-selected what they got to go through.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:33.120
And what I really loved about this was it's difficult to get within a company all the people that care about something together.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.340
And this allowed people to self-select into what they care about.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:44.140
And so I had people coming up to me from different divisions that we would have never interacted with before.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.000
Working on similar problems allow us to work together.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:56.480
And I think it's definitely worthwhile for a company to actually reduce costs by spending a little to bring people together to talk about similar things.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.060
Anyway, that's just my plug.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.600
And then the other thing was flying back.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:06.720
I couldn't sleep on the plane, so I had a ton of time to do something.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:11.180
And I got started on a first draft for the second book I'd like to

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:12.620
read.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.340
I love it how just stepping away just a little bit sometimes you'll be like, alright, that's it.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.140
I'm working on this project.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.160
It just gives you that little bit of

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.980
space from

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.120
all the day-to-day. That's cool.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:23.780
Yeah.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.220
Anyway, so it was good.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:39.300
Great. And if you look at that picture, just to the left of that Castle Church thing, I had a really nice beer brewery brow house evening one night over there in Munich. It's a fun place

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.160
yeah cool

00:27:42.160 --> 00:28:08.380
cool all right are we ready for jokes we are as a person who is known to be good with computers sometimes you get dragged into tech support even though i don't know about you i'm not especially good at tech support and i don't necessarily desire to make that skill better I present you the quick and handy manual on how to fix your computer you ready?

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:23.220
yeah I can't do any more than that so it gives you three options do you have Windows, do you have a Mac or do you have Linux so option one it says Windows, step one, reboot did that fix it?

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.280
no?

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:33.880
well then proceed to the next step alright next step is format hard drive reinstall Windows, lose all your files quietly weep okay

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:35.660
let's

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:45.680
see if I can make this bigger there we go the Apple one step one take it to the Apple store did that fix it?

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:46.380
no?

00:28:46.940 --> 00:29:34.260
step two is buy a new Mac overdraw your account quietly weep okay well Linux is more DYI so let's see about that one this is step one learn to code in C recompile the kernel build your own microprocessor out of spare silicon you have laying around recompile the kernel again switch distros recompile the kernel again but this time using a CPU powered by refracted light from Saturn grow a giant beard blame Sun Microsystems turn your bedroom into a server closet and spend 10 years falling asleep to the sound of whirring fans switch distros again abandon all hygiene write a regular expression that would make other programmers cry blood learn to code in Java, recompile the kernel again, but this time wearing your lucky socks.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.980
Did that fix it? No. Proceed to step two.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.880
Revert back using Windows or Mac and quietly weep.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:42.860
What do you think?

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.800
Yeah, plus it's 10 years later, so the Macs are going to be zipping by then.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.660
They definitely will.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:50.280
Wow.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.440
If anyone needs to do tech support for their family,

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.860
I present the manual.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.180
Step-by-step guide. Step one and step two.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:58.640
Yeah.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:07.660
yeah it's funny definitely alright well happy to have you back stateside even though you had a good trip to Germany and we'll see everyone next week

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.960
good to be back

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.340

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.460
bye Bye.
