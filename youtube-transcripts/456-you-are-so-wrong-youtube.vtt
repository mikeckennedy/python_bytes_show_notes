00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:02.080
Hey, Brian.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.860
How's it going?

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:05.000
It's great.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.640
It's going good.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.300
Good.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.380
And hey, everyone.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.940
Thanks for being here.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.540
Thanks for either being at the live stream or watching the live recording afterwards,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.640
just knowing otherwise is a recording, but the unedited version.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.000
All right, we ready to kick this off?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.700
Yeah.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.760
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.380
This is episode 456, recorded November 3rd, 2025.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.760
I am Michael Kennedy.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.480
And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.460
And Brian, I'm getting Guns N' Roses vibes.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.180
It's raining outside.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.060
It's November.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.200
Come on.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.360
Guns N' Roses?

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.720
That's one of their songs.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.960
That's like, once they were kind of cool, then they became some other band that was more of like love ballads.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.260
November Rain.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.180
It's a Guns N' Roses song.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.100
Oh, okay.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.760
November Rain.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.080
Okay.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.640
Got it.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.820
I'm like, it's rainy in the Northwest?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.540
That's just not that much news.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.320
No, hold on.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.000
I got to go back.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:04.900
We're going to do music.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.740
That completely, entirely encompasses all of Pearl Jam,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.000
all of Nirvana, all of Soundgarden, period.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.720
Is November rain?

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.000
Or rainy in the Northwest?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.860
No, rainy in the Northwest.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.340
Like the whole grunge movement, right?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.000
Yeah, definitely.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.640
And I would just, I mean, look,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.400
I'm getting some support from the audience here.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.220
Rhett out there is already saying November rain

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.400
is one of the greatest rock ballads of all time.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.080
And I agree.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.620
Thank you, Rhett.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.240
Although I will throw Tesla out there

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.460
as the greatest rock ballads of all time.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.800
Banned.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.480
All right.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.200
Are we off track yet, Brian?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.540
This episode was brought to you by us.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.500
We've got a bunch of fun things.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.780
We have Tesla the band, not the scientist, not the company.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.800
We both have awesome books.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.000
You should check them out.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.500
Brian, yours has been around for a while.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.180
I don't know if you're ever going to write another one, but we'll see.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.460
And how many people write the second book, right?

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.940
I imagine that you might do something like this.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.260
And my book's going really well, the Talk Python in production.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.460
Like, hey, maybe we could do simplified, affordable, but still fast and professional

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.600
hosting of our apps without hyperscale clouds.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.260
And 100 services and cloud engineers and all that.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.020
And if you want to be part of this show live, you can join us live.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.320
Are we changing times, Ryan?

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.080
It's 11 for good now, isn't it?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.680
Well, as far as my work schedule goes right now, 11 works.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.680
All right, everyone.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.500
I just want you to know what I'm out here doing for you.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.500
So I'm going to have to go back and edit 455 episodes where we said,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.660
watch the live stream at Monday at 10 a.m.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.780
I'm going to have to replace that with watch the live stream

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.220
at Monday at 11 a.m.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.800
You're not actually going to do that, are you?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.420
No, I'm not going to have to do that.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.000
Not unless AI can do it for me.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.660
That's not happening.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.100
But going forward, if you want to join us for the live stream,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.700
please do so at exactly this time, 11 a.m.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.760
I'm sure there's some sort of time zone weirdness

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.640
because we just changed time.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.420
But Pacific Standard Time until it becomes Daylight Time.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.900
We'd love to have you.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.720
We'd love people in the audience with feedback and thoughts

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.740
and all that kind of fun stuff.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.700
Check out the newsletter.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.760
It's really great.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.600
We've been telling you about it.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.900
Sign up, pythonbytes.fm.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.440
I'll just go there and click the newsletter button.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.920
All right, Brian.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.820
What are you clicking first?

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.740
So I want to talk about some news that came out last week.

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:46.260
So there's...

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.340
Oh, on the wrong one.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.840
There we go.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.160
The PSF wanted to try to get some money from the National Science Foundation.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.400
Actually, so this was in January of 2025.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:11.100
There was a really kind of an interesting grant under the Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open Source Ecosystems Program,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.540
which totally seems like a perfect thing for the PSF to try to get some money for Seth and others

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.620
to make sure that the PSF and Python code is all secure.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.420
Yeah, especially, I think, the supply chain side, if I remember correctly.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.320
Something like that.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:38.380
However, and they put in a ton of work, and then our current administration says,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:50.540
In order to get this money, you have to agree that you will basically not have any sort of diversity, anything is part of your whatever.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.680
And, you know, what's going on?

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:06.860
You have to affirm that we do not and will not during the term of this Financial Assistance Award operate any programs or advance any or promote DEI or discriminatory equity, whatever.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.560
All that normal, wacky politics stuff that's going on in the US right now.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.100
Well, that's a tough bite for the PSF because it wouldn't just be the security stuff.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.900
It would be everything the PSF does.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.180
And in the mission statement, the mission statement of the Python Software Foundation

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.380
is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.220
and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.460
of Python programmers.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.180
does that violate we don't know so they like you know checked with a bunch of people and

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.480
basically said it's too it's too risky because if the administration decides you violated it

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.980
they can take back the money even if you've already spent it um that's crazy and uh i'm glad

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:03.180
basically the psf said too too high of a risk and uh we're not going to do that so they um they said

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.880
No, they took back the proposal.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.820
I think they basically were going to win it,

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.380
it's my understanding, like it was turned down 1.5 million,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.760
which if you think about it is something like 25% of their revenue.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.500
That's a really big, significant chunk.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.620
Yeah, I mean, huge amount of money,

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.760
and a small amount of money for the National Science Foundation,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.720
a huge amount of money for the PSF.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.380
It's unfortunate, but anyway.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.620
we're going to link to the

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.480
PSF announcement

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.800
but there's also

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.580
Simon Wilson has a

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.880
shorter and really good

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.320
write up

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.660
he's part of the decision

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.320
too and agrees with it

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.820
apparently it was unanimous

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.580
so he's on one of the

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.700
board members who voted to reject

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.160
the funding

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.720
and then there's also articles

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.900
from Mars Technica about this

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.400
because it's

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.340
big news. And also, The Register has an interesting article on it, so we'll link to those.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.740
Yeah, that is a little bit more broad coverage of inside baseball and Python than we usually get.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.780
Yeah, it's unfortunate too. So I'm going to bump up my donation to the PSF,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:31.320
and there's a link in most of these, at least in the main article, and Simon Wilson has a link

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.120
there also if you'd like to if you think what they're doing is right and good stuff and i i

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.620
actually really love the what what well everybody does but um uh bringing seth on board was pretty

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:47.420
cool and he's doing some neat things with security and so so are other people so yeah anyway that's

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:55.800
that yeah more security is good for us but yeah it's gotta pay for it that's tricky okay let's

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.860
Let's jump over to talk about serialization.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.040
And there is no funding or nothing in the serialization.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.620
Just straight serialization, Brian.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.820
So check this out.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.400
One thing that's really popular--

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.620
I don't know if you've heard of them before, but Pydantic.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.680
It's pretty popular.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.040
Some people use it for-- they have JSON,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.480
and they want to get into Python objects.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.060
They use this thing called Pydantic.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.400
Yeah, it's kind of a big deal.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.500
It is.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.520
But here's what the Pydantic things do.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.000
They exchange JSON, right?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.040
And JSON can be extremely verbose,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.280
AKA takes a lot of memory during caching.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.960
So let's suppose I have a list of 1,000 customers.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.960
Each customer has a street address, country, postal code,

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.060
et cetera, et cetera, right?

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:45.420
Those words are repeated 1,000 times.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.500
How many customers I said?

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.040
100, 1,000, whatever, right?

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.040
Those are very verbose.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:50.900
It's great for humans.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.680
way, way better than XML.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.580
Thank you for XML mostly going away.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.540
But it's still pretty verbose.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.620
So when you say, maybe I want to use Pydantic models,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.160
but then I want to store those things

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.120
in some kind of cached setup, right?

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.420
Like a Redist or a disk cache.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.620
Like, man, I'm psyched about disk cache these days.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.860
So many places I see that I can use it.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.200
But if you put the JSON in there, then you're

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:18.960
taking up a lot of space.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:25.240
So this project, announced on Reddit by Lucky2yan,

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:30.320
is called-- what's the actual project called?

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.320
It's called PyBintic?

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.540
Is it in Pydantic?

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.040
So binary Pydantic, which is interesting.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:46.299
So it says, I built a compact binary serializer

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.000
for Pydantic models that dramatically reduces the RAM

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.600
and/or disk storage for caches compared to JSON.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.520
The library is designed for high load systems

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.720
like Redis caching Valkey, if you're doing Redis,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.280
you can also look at Valkey, where millions of models

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.020
are stored in memory and every byte matters.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.080
It serializes Pydantic models into minimal binary formats

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.000
and deserializes them back with zero extra metadata overhead.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:11.860
Cool.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.060
If you look-- is there a graph here?

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.160
No, there is the graph on the GitHub page.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.120
So there is a graph about the size,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.500
but it's something like seven times smaller.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.040
There's a bunch here.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:24.640
Let's look.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:30.860
It compares to JSON, which is, let's say, 35 gigs.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.040
And then Pybantic--

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.680
I'm having problems here--

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.520
is 4.6, which is like nine, eight times smaller than JSON.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.300
But that's pretty interesting.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.380
But here's what is actually really crazy.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.720
It's also four times smaller than MessagePack, five times

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.320
smaller than binary JSON, and half as big as Protobuf.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.200
Oh, interesting.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.260
And Rhett out there is right there.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.460
Thank you, Rhett, for the handoff.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.780
So why not just use Protobuf?

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.040
Well, it's twice as small.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.920
So it depends how much you are really worried about that,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.780
right, and how much do you want to just serialize

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.380
your bidentic models.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.139
So anyway, I thought this was interesting in a way

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.360
that it would say, look, maybe we don't just necessarily

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.560
store everything in JSON.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.840
Maybe use this Pybantic thing.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.180
Or maybe, as Rhett is pointing out in the audience,

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.820
maybe you want something more interchangeable and more well

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.200
known, use protobuf.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.900
So it's a chance to talk about this new project, which

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.600
is interesting, but also just to talk about there's

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.920
interesting well-known serialization formats

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.500
that you can use.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.080
Yeah.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:42.680
Yeah.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.900
And I think we can get those numbers better.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.520
If we like, we come up with a benchmark with really long names.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:49.700
Yeah.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.660
Like Boolean objects that are just like the street that I lived on when I was a kid.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.700
Underscore.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.020
Yeah.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.940
Street that I lived on underscore kid as a kid confirmed true or false and so on.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.100
Right.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.280
Yeah.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.820
We could crush it in anything that drops the.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:09.900
Yeah.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:11.740
Drop it.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.500
So yeah, someone else out there said,

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.980
all these things sound kind of interesting

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.260
until you need to open up a REST client and debug the API.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.100
Yes, that's true.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.280
And I don't believe that this is necessarily an API exchange

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.640
format.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.500
This is a caching story.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:27.620
Right?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.080
If I'm going to write it to disk cache or to Redis or Valkey,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.180
I'm probably not going to look at it.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.440
I'm just going, is it still there,

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.260
or do I just throw it away?

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.260
Maybe you do, but maybe you don't.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.980
Anyway, yes, everyone has pointed out

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.640
that there are certainly trade-offs of binary data,

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.640
but I think it's pretty interesting.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:55.160
Look, the thing is, often the very first limit you hit

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.320
when you're in any sort of cloud computing environment

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.940
is way, way sooner memory than CPU.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.480
Memory is so much more expensive than CPU,

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.560
and this can give you half, five times less,

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.160
scale in that regard. So you might be, you know, that's where you start. This is not when I'm just

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.080
like prototyping my app, like, let's start with this, right? This is where you're like,

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:27.460
we could go from a $1,000 server to a $50 server if we didn't have to store this much stuff in

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.120
memory for caching and it would still be faster, whatever, you know, that kind of thing.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.880
Yeah. Yeah. And there's still like, I don't know if this would be useful in those cases,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.680
but there's still non-web cases where memory is important.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.560
Oh, Brian, what are you talking about?

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.300
Internet things and stuff like that, embedded systems.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.580
There's stuff other than the web? No.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.000
I know. I'm an old, crufty guy that actually programs things.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.260
Crazy. No, here. What's your next thing? Tell us about it.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.840
Okay. Well, this is t-strings. These are new.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.180
Actually, we've talked about t-strings before.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:09.380
But now everybody can play with them because 3.14 is out.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.840
Yeah, they're officially a thing.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.340
But they're a little, I think we're going to cover them probably a few more times

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.980
because they're a little bit harder to get your head around than everything else before.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.300
So I really appreciate, there's an article from Trey Hunter,

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.040
T-String's Python's fifth string formatting technique.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.980
There should be one and only one way to do things unless it has to do with strings.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.380
Yeah, or lots of other things.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.800
Or paths, or what else are we going to talk about?

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:48.640
So one of the cool things is, and I haven't really thought about this, is the history of string formatting.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.640
He goes through a very brief history.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.740
Percent strings, I kind of remember those.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.660
Yeah, I totally remember using those.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:01.660
Like percent s, and then percent, and then the tuple to fill them in and stuff.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.540
So those sorts of template strings.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.580
You've got string.template, which I actually, to tell you the truth, that came in in 2.4.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:15.080
And I don't think I ever used it because by 2.6, we had.format.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.600
So Python, the.format, we used a lot.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.820
I used that a lot over the years.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.880
It's still a useful one, actually.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.460
Yeah, definitely.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:30.499
And also in a lot of places where you might grab t-strings now, they're still pretty useful

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.020
because you can pass those around pretty well

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.800
and then format them later.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.100
And that's sort of that delayed actually formatting part

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.660
where t-strings are going to be really cool.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.520
So then we have f-strings, of course,

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.700
and everybody loves f-strings.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.220
I love them.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.780
And what's interesting is I still think of f-strings as a new thing,

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.420
but they came in at 3.6.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.420
That was so long ago.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.240
I know.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.080
That was real long ago.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.420
It's wacky.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.660
And then 314 has t-strings.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.320
And the different thing about t-strings is they return a template.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.780
They do not return a string.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.100
So they are different beasts.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.260
But the cool thing is, well, so why would you use them?

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.500
We've talked about this before, but I kind of like that Trey took a whack at explaining this.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.780
They're more like you might want to use, I don't remember if he said it or somebody else.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.760
It'll be very useful for library authors and framework people to be using t-strings.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.620
Not sure how many people, like, in your own code you'll use it,

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.540
because f-strings are still pretty cool in format.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.580
But he gives an example of a dedent function that is...

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.960
The issue with f-strings is the when you...

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.780
Like, that the interpolation of filling in the variables happens earlier,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.980
and you can delay it with templates, essentially.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.320
is what we're talking about.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.120
And he goes through a DDent example.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.020
And I actually, I'm going to have to just play with it more

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.520
because I still got lost.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:09.040
But this is a good attempt, and I think this is cool.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.300
And then one of the neat things, I love it when people do this,

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:17.140
is why not, if you're used to popping things on PyPI,

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:25.339
he went ahead and called this better DDent and his example

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.620
and threw it up on PyPI.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.339
So if you want to play with what he came up with,

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:29.720
you can just install it, run it.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:30.660
Okay.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:31.800
Yeah, very fun.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.500
I feel like he should create

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.800
not just a bunch of separate little things

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.740
that are for his examples,

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:40.960
but like a mega,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.740
like a morsels with a complex CLI

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.680
that lets you dive into the different examples.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.980
I mean, he would have,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.660
but the grant got canceled.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.380
Oh, I see.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.320
Well, it's only the security features

00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:02.200
make it oh yeah right never mind no that's actually a decent idea like because he's got a lot

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.060
of uh he's got a lot of stuff cool stuff on the python morsel site so yeah for sure like some

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:17.840
yeah for sure okay let's talk about something called cron uh cron board speaking of putting up

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.280
up at like a TUI or a CLI sort of thing.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.040
So Brian, how many cron jobs have you done?

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.320
At this time?

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:28.940
They have weird syntax.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.100
I don't know if you're familiar with it,

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.980
but they have really weird little syntax

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:33.840
that you can put in.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.060
I don't know if there's a good example on this thing,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.920
but like star, star, seven, star.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.040
Like it's kind of hard to figure out all the pieces,

00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:47.180
understand what they mean, see what ones are on your machine,

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:53.400
so on. So this thing called CronBoard is a terminal app written with textual and

00:18:53.480 --> 00:19:03.300
rich that is basically a shell friendly or SSH friendly tool for understanding

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:09.820
and using like look at telling me like what particular things are on here as a

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:16.139
cron job, what are their settings, you can see like it's 10 that a 1-10 star star

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.880
star three star and actually the little thing validates the expression how often that actually

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:30.200
means that runs and so on isn't this cool yeah it is cool yeah yeah i always have to use some sort

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:36.200
of tool to figure this out because i know i'm like no i'm gonna get it wrong look it's so messy it's

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:41.380
so weird i admire the old gray beards that used to be able to just do this in their head or on

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.740
paper but yeah not me that's right like this could definitely qualify for it's some form of elvish

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.420
joke yeah right i mean we put it on regular expressions but it could be on cron job expressions

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:58.220
as well yeah anyway that's all there is to it there's not a whole lot to say about it it's

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:05.420
written in python which is fun so do you have do you have um thinking about why you chose this

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:11.240
maybe just for the fun of it but do you do you have uh cron jobs in what you're doing on talk

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:17.360
done? Not exactly. I sort of do, but a lot of it is like background. I think it's more like a

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:24.220
background task that checks every hour. And so I've kind of kept it to that because I don't know.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.440
I like, I'm sure people get this vibe about me, but like, I like stuff more cohesive and stuck

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:34.580
together and just like focused and not all spread out all over the place. Like, okay, so this script

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.940
runs on that cron job and then this part checks the database and this thing over here, you know

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.140
what I mean?

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.260
Like, so if I can cram it together and go,

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.080
the part that needs that can also just run like a background

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.580
thread and every now and then just go,

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.380
does that need checked or rebuilt or reindexed or whatever?

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.720
But I could certainly see places where if I was more comfortable

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.740
with cron jobs, I would do a better job with them

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.780
and things would probably be simpler.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:56.900
So there's that.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:20:59.880
Yeah, cron board.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:00.280
Check it out.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:00.640
Looks fun.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:01.460
Cool.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.240
We're on to extras.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.060
You're the only extra.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.660
I got nothing

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.100
okay well

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.240
there's some exciting news

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.840
I just heard this morning

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.780
oh because it just happened this morning

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.020
Barry Warsaw announced

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.480
and

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.400
PEP 810

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.080
explicit lazy imports we've been talking about this

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.160
for a while and it was

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.200
not approved yet it was just

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.200
a draft but it is approved now

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.900
so steering council

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.340
happily

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.080
and unanimously

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.120
accepted A10 explicit lazy imports.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.060
They have some input for the authors,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.520
but basically it's a really nice commentary.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:51.920
A revise and resubmit sort of acceptance from the academic side.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.960
Like, we'll take it, but not as it is.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:55.900
Yeah, it's okay.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.700
Well, I mean, but that's kind of one of the cool things

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:00.680
about the steering council,

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.420
because you can do things like when you submit something,

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.940
you can, like, as this is done.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.260
And actually, this was a really well-written, I thought, well-written PEP.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.980
But you can say things like, there's a few points like what keyword to use.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.700
The PEP authors liked lazy, but there were a couple of other options.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.020
And the steering council went through and tried to figure out if they could come up with a better name.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.700
I mean, if there's options, why not give it to the steering council and say, you guys can decide if you want.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.860
But yeah, so pretty cool.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.520
I wonder what that means for anybody

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.440
that has a global variable named lazy,

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.220
in terms of compatibility.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.040
I mean, it would be fine as long as they don't use it

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.220
in the import statement.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.620
I think it probably would not do anything at all.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.220
I know the early Python parser had a hard time

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.300
with disambiguating that kind of stuff.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.740
but I think maybe the peg parser is more advanced.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.460
Well, I know the peg parser is more advanced.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.360
Maybe it can handle it.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:14.060
Like in C#, they have certain words

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.360
that they themselves are not keywords,

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.460
but taken as a pair, they are keywords.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.220
Like lazy space import.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:28.940
So in C#, you have yield return is a keyword thing,

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.900
but you can have a variable named yield as well,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.900
and they will be understood as different by the parser.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.520
And I think that that was not true in early Python,

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.700
but I could be wrong about that.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.660
Well, luckily we have listeners,

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.440
and Hugo is listening, which is great,

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.560
and in the chat says lazy will be a soft keyword,

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.740
so you could reuse it later.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.620
Okay, good.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.420
And also I forgot to give Hugo a shout out.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.600
That is his post on social media that announced that.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.400
The reason why I saw the announcement was from Hugo.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.160
So thanks, Hugo.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:05.680
Yeah, awesome.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.900
And thanks for all the stuff, Hugo.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:10.900
You give us a lot of good pointers, either directly or just by writing.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.100
Okay.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:12.480
Cool.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.060
Yeah, so I think I'm excited about it.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.540
The other thing, which this is me not reading the  PEP end-to-end,

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.880
but I'm going to be curious to see how it unfolds with typing.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.280
Because I know that you highlighted it.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.420
I can say if type checking, then you can do regular imports

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.680
versus lazy imports.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.580
But if the next line I write is my function

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.220
takes an object of one of the things that was lazily imported,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.400
does that execute its import effectively?

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.260
I don't know.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:39.900
We're going to find out.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.540
We'll find out?

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:47.000
I'm guessing the steering council probably thought about that.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:47.740
I do.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.499
I would say so because that was a real big problem

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.340
when they were trying to change the way imports worked a little bit earlier

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.680
for things like Pydantic, you know, bringing that back around, right?

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.260
They're like, oh, this is going to be really bad.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.380
We won't know what things are anymore.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:01.640
Help.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:02.940
Yeah.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:03.720
Awesome.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.940
Okay.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.580
So that's the really big news for everybody.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.700
And then I have really big news that mostly applies to me.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:17.220
The big news is that I've started writing again.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:27.440
And I've actually decided I am a big proponent of lean, lean, like lean philosophy and everything.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:35.460
And part of lean is actually just getting the whole pipeline, the entire chain from top to bottom in place early.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.180
And so I've decided to do that with the book.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:42.100
So the entire purchase process, at least for this, is already in place.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.780
I've got a lean TDD site up.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.860
There's actually a table of contents figured out already.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.500
I've got, I know what I'm going to write.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.020
There's not much there yet.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.640
There's like 10 pages written of introduction.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.140
But if you want to get updates every time I go through it,

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.840
you can go ahead and grab a copy if you want.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:08.100
And I'll send you, well, the system will send you updates every time I have something new.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.260
Also, it took me, what, a year?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:19.600
The process from I want to write a book to it's out for the Python testing with pytest for both editions was a year and a half.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.460
I don't want to take that long.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:27.260
I'd like to get this one through the first draft and a pretty good state of a first draft.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.700
It would be more like a beta thing by the end of the year.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.660
That's my goal.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.400
Awesome.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:33.860
Congratulations.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:34.700
That's awesome.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:35.540
Thanks.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.880
Also, with all of this extra junk around, like getting a landing page and all that stuff,

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.420
it wasn't tons of work, but it takes away from writing.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:48.860
So I'm glad that I can get back to writing and get this thing kicked out.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.340
Yeah, people don't necessarily, even when it's your project,

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.180
you don't think about how much those little extra things are going to take.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.920
It's like, oh, I can just put this app up and, oh, people have to reset their password.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.240
Oh, that means I got to support email.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.480
Oh, okay, well, how am I going to do email?

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.740
I don't want to send email, but here I am writing an email service because apparently people have to log in or something.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.040
Yeah, and I'm also reviewing it.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:17.020
One of the things I didn't – I'm not thrilled with how the pytest book shows up on Kindles.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.300
So I'm checking out the book from a Kindle.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:29.680
That's where I'm doing my proofreading to make sure that that's like an e-book first way to produce the book.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:30.740
Yeah, awesome.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.360
I love it.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.100
All right, cool.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.060
How about something funny?

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.180
Yeah, let's round it out with a joke, huh?

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:39.160
Yeah.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:46.280
Okay, so we used to talk a lot about Stack Overflow.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.480
And Stack Overflow had this reputation, still does,

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.220
just we talk about it less,

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.420
that Stack Overflow people were kind of mean.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:57.740
You'd ask a question.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.220
Well, the people in Stack Overflow,

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.480
I think the actual Stack Overflow people were fine.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.200
Yeah, I mean the community members.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.240
A lot of the people, they would be quick to judge,

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.720
quick to say that question's already been asked and answered.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.120
It was asked three years ago.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.500
You know, not amazing, right?

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.260
And it can be really daunting, especially newcomers.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.560
And so the feel for Stack Overflow might be,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.200
you're absolutely wrong, might be a subtitle.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.100
Right?

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.520
But these days, no, we can feel all good about it.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.680
You're absolutely right, says ChatGPT.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.640
See, it's good to be a programmer now because instead of you're absolutely wrong,

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.500
you're absolutely right.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:39.800
They both could be wrong.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.800
But they're sure that you're wrong or you're right, depending on who you ask.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:47.440
Yeah.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.640
You know, my daughter even ran into that.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.980
She was stuck on some chemistry homework.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.400
And she asked ChatGPT to ask something.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:58.880
I don't know.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.260
I think it was ChatGPT.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.700
And she got an answer back.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.200
She's like, that just doesn't look right.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.960
And it said, oh, you're right.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.320
It's wrong.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.820
And then it came up with a different answer.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.880
And she's like, this is ridiculous.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:13.880
How do I trust it then?

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.080
Yeah, exactly.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.060
I do think that's why it works better for programmers

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.620
than for many other groups.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.260
Because you can run the code and at least see if it runs

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.000
or doesn't run.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.000
And that's a form of a check.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.580
Or if you're doing some compiling,

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:35.600
see if it compiles or parses or whatever whereas if it does like a chemistry theory you're like well

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.320
i guess i could do a year's worth of research and see if this is right or wrong but i don't know

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.260
you know i mean go to the lab and start right doing experiments like it's just it's just the

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.400
the feedback loop is real quick for us so but it's still you're absolutely right like no

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.519
i'm actually wrong just what are you doing anyway we live in weird times here's a fun joke about it

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:56.720
Yeah.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.540
Oh, I'm going to grab the screen again.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.480
Oh, I already took it down.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:02.920
Never mind.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.660
I'll do an extra next week, another extra.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:06.940
All right.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.960
Well, with that, we're going to have something to look forward to, right?

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:10.700
Yeah.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.180
Yeah.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.300
So, cool.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:13.660
All right.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:14.420
Catch you later.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.080
Bye, Brian.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:15.500
Thanks, everyone.
