00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Brian Okken>Hey, everybody. Hey, Michael.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:02.780
<v Brian Okken>Hey.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Brian Okken>I'm a little bright for all of you web watchers, but that's all right.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.020
<v Brian Okken>I am excited that it is December 22nd, and it's almost Christmas.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Brian Okken>It's pretty fun.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Brian Okken>So let's kick it off this last episode of the year.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Brian Okken>Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.900
<v Brian Okken>This is episode 463, recorded December 22nd, 2025.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Brian Okken>I am Brian Okken.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Brian Okken>And I am Michael Kennedy.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Brian Okken>And this episode is sponsored by us.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Brian Okken>So support us by heading over to Michael's courses, my courses,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.500
<v Brian Okken>at Talk Python Training or PythonTest.com,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Brian Okken>or just go over and see what we got at the pythonbytes.fm.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Let me add one more thing real quick there, Brian.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Sorry to hijack your intro, but hey, we're coming up on 2026, and it's about time to be scheduling sponsors on the ad calendar for the next year.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Michael Kennedy>So if companies out there, if you're listening, you're like, why does my company not support Python Bytes and sponsor it?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes, a fine question you should be taking up with your marketing team.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Have them reach out to me.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Michael Kennedy>And right now, there's a bunch of openings.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Michael Kennedy>We'll see if they get bought up or not as things go.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, just send me an email.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, actually, that'd be great.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Brian Okken>I'd love to have more sponsors on the show.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Brian Okken>If you want to reach us for sponsoring or any other ways,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Brian Okken>there's links on the show page, pythonbytes.fm.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Brian Okken>You can also find links to all of our socials.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Brian Okken>We're at Mastodon and Fosstodon, both us individually and the show.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Brian Okken>And also, if you'd like to watch us live, you can go to pythonbytes.com slash live and see what it is and find the links.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Brian Okken>And then as well, while you're there, sign up for the mailing list so we can send you all the links we talk about directly to your inbox.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.400
<v Brian Okken>All righty.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Brian Okken>Oh, one more thing before we get started.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Brian Okken>We are taking, normally we record on Monday mornings.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Brian Okken>And we are taking next week off and we will be back in 2026.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Brian Okken>So.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Brian Okken>All right.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Brian Okken>Take, kick us off, Michael.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.480
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's end of the year.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Michael Kennedy>As you said, we'll be back first, first week of January,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Michael Kennedy>but it's a little bit of a introspective end of the year is what I want to

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.360
<v Michael Kennedy>leave people with.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Michael Kennedy>So people may have noticed I usually cover tools, libraries,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Michael Kennedy>or updates to those kinds of things and so on.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Michael Kennedy>But on this episode, I want to cover two articles

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.340
<v Michael Kennedy>that I came across recently that I think they'll make you think.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Michael Kennedy>They'll make you really evaluate the situation.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Michael Kennedy>One has to do with agentic coding

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Michael Kennedy>and one has to do with why open source won

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.540
<v Michael Kennedy>and continues to win.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.080
<v Michael Kennedy>But more importantly, what is one of the really key ingredients?

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.620
<v Michael Kennedy>So as we look towards the future for more sustainability, let's not kill the golden goose by changing that thing.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Michael Kennedy>So the first one is, has the cost of building software just dropped 90%?

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Michael Kennedy>That's a pretty stark headline, isn't it?

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.360
<v Michael Kennedy>What are the consequences, right?

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Does that mean like, well, you thought it was hard to get a job earlier as a junior.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Just hang on to your pants now.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Or does it mean something else?

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.860
<v Michael Kennedy>We'll see.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Michael Kennedy>well at least we'll see what Martin Alderson said because that's the article he wrote this article

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Michael Kennedy>and I think it is super insightful and interesting so kind of want to just pull out some highlights

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Michael Kennedy>and put it out there for you all to think about as you got some downtime so the premise is

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.979
<v Michael Kennedy>basically that many of the recent programming quote advancements that are like gonna change

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.959
<v Michael Kennedy>the world, going to actually absolutely change the way things work, haven't really.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Michael Kennedy>For example, test-driven development, cloud computing, especially hyperscale clouds,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Michael Kennedy>microservices, complex front ends like React and so on, Angular, whatever.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Kubernetes, sure, they're advancements and they help in some way or another

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Michael Kennedy>for various things, but they're not bending the curve dramatically on how we write software

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.220
<v Michael Kennedy>how much more we get done and so on.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Somewhat, but not massively.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Michael Kennedy>But they say,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.880
<v Michael Kennedy>let me see if I can find it, yeah, here we go.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.760
<v Michael Kennedy>The economics have dramatically changed now

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.900
<v Michael Kennedy>with agentic coding.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Michael Kennedy>And I agree, I think it really has.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.400
<v Michael Kennedy>And I know a lot of people are frustrated with AI

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.840
<v Michael Kennedy>or they don't wanna use AI and so on.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.800
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm not here to make people do that, but I am here to put it on your radar that

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.900
<v Michael Kennedy>this is something you're going to have to be paying attention to.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.120
<v Michael Kennedy>And Martin thinks so as well.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Michael Kennedy>He says in 2026 is going to catch a lot of people off guard.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think so too.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.960
<v Michael Kennedy>So he kind of goes through the history a little bit of like changes, how open

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.560
<v Michael Kennedy>source actually made a huge change, how cloud was supposed to make a big change,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.960
<v Michael Kennedy>but it just added a crap ton of complexity and a lot of other things.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.740
<v Michael Kennedy>So in a lot of just sort of how complexity has grown over time, instead of these things

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Michael Kennedy>making us able to write more software or better software, a lot of times it's just

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.700
<v Michael Kennedy>handled more complex software or kind of doing the same thing.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.600
<v Michael Kennedy>So where's the 90% savings come from?

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Michael Kennedy>So he says, like you, probably I was incredibly skeptical of a lot of AI coding

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.180
<v Michael Kennedy>tools at the beginning of the year, but things are changing fast.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.920
<v Michael Kennedy>And previously, let's say I want to add some small capability to my app.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.680
<v Michael Kennedy>How do you do it?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, you're going to assemble a team of people.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.680
<v Michael Kennedy>You're going to set up continuous integration.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Michael Kennedy>You're going to build out data access patterns,

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.120
<v Michael Kennedy>and you're going to plan that out in an architecture meeting.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Really, it's just a bunch of crud, but people make a big deal out of it.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.760
<v Michael Kennedy>So you're going to over-engineer it probably.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.360
<v Michael Kennedy>And you're going to set up some testing and so on.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And that's just direct labor, right?

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.760
<v Michael Kennedy>You've got all the management.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.580
<v Michael Kennedy>And one of the things that's really interesting about this article is the

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.060
<v Michael Kennedy>mythical man month aspect of this.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, okay, well that's going to take two weeks.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, what if we add four people to it?

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, it'll take one and a half weeks.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, wait, why is that not a half a week?

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.360
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, it's like the coordination, the communication, the in factorial ways

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Michael Kennedy>in which there can be like blocking or communication or meetings or

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.720
<v Michael Kennedy>coordination and so on.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.060
<v Michael Kennedy>And so these coding tools have got really, really good.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.220
<v Michael Kennedy>And as you add one of these coding tools in,

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.720
<v Michael Kennedy>you don't have to have meetings with it.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.940
<v Michael Kennedy>You don't have to have it working with three other ones

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Michael Kennedy>of them so that it can coordinate different skill sets

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.620
<v Michael Kennedy>and so on.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.740
<v Michael Kennedy>And so in a sense, it really lowers the number

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.600
<v Michael Kennedy>of connections in that mythical man month,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Michael Kennedy>but still adds a lot of capabilities.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.520
<v Michael Kennedy>So pretty interesting.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.680
<v Michael Kennedy>So final takeaway is like on the face of it,

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.140
<v Michael Kennedy>this seems like incredibly bad news for the software development

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Michael Kennedy>industry.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Indeed.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Michael Kennedy>But a look at history, let's see.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.960
<v Michael Kennedy>So Jevons Paradox comes from back in the day

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.000
<v Michael Kennedy>when coal usage became super efficient, right?

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Instead of just burning it in an open pit or whatever

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.760
<v Michael Kennedy>to like heat something, we put it into the steam engines

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Michael Kennedy>and it does way more work per, you know,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.580
<v Michael Kennedy>joule of energy or whatever, right?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Michael Kennedy>It says, look, at least this guy, Martin, thinks this applies.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Jevon's paradox also is going to apply to software.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Michael Kennedy>That when something becomes cheaper to produce, it's not that we just use it less.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.820
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, well, we've got five developers, but now they're way more efficient.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.960
<v Michael Kennedy>So let's get rid of four of them.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.700
<v Michael Kennedy>That's one possible outcome.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Michael Kennedy>The other is like, let's just build five times as much software as we used to, right?

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:33.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And so an example is from history is when coal became way cheaper, its use skyrocketed.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.219
<v Michael Kennedy>Not cheaper, efficient.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.780
<v Michael Kennedy>You didn't need to spend as much coal to get stuff done.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.800
<v Michael Kennedy>But in fact, it actually blew up way, way more.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.760
<v Michael Kennedy>So super interesting.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.040
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think there's something to that.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I think there's a ton of latent demand for software.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.960
<v Michael Kennedy>So anyway, there's a whole section on that that's pretty interesting, I think.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Brian Okken>i think there is a lot of i'm i've mixed emotions about this i think there is a lot of light and

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Brian Okken>demand i am dealing with both both agent driven or agent developed software on a professional

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:23.659
<v Brian Okken>basis both from experts and from novices in the company and it's producing five times as much code

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.920
<v Brian Okken>but you get five times as much bad code from bad developers.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:37.660
<v Brian Okken>I'm just saying, there is a, like, let's say we have five times the amount of code,

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.200
<v Brian Okken>or five times the product, you know, do more things.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.540
<v Brian Okken>That's 5Xing your code base that you have to maintain in the future too.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.399
<v Brian Okken>And we really haven't figured out how to deal with the increased maintenance cost

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.180
<v Brian Okken>of this agent-driven software yet.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.220
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I agree with that.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.120
<v Brian Okken>Also, the test-driven development,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.620
<v Brian Okken>I think we didn't get the gains out of that

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.840
<v Brian Okken>because people were teaching it wrong.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, I mean, it's also, of course,

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.300
<v Michael Kennedy>but I think also there's a difference

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Michael Kennedy>between full-on extreme programming

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.840
<v Michael Kennedy>and just, hey, let's make sure we have tests for our code.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.059
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, there's also, should we test our code

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.540
<v Brian Okken>and should we unit test it?

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Brian Okken>And that's the big part that I get.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.300
<v Brian Okken>But also, can we scroll up to that complexity chart

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:32.980
<v Brian Okken>or the little graph?

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.820
<v Brian Okken>I think that AI agents are going to not drive down complexity.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.380
<v Brian Okken>I think we might get efficiency gains,

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.140
<v Brian Okken>but I don't think, I think we're going to get some,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.820
<v Brian Okken>the complexity is going to go up just like it did with cloud.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.280
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what's really interesting about all this discussion, and I'm not disagreeing with you on this.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:12.200
<v Michael Kennedy>I think if people have the opinion that they're just going to set these things loose on code bases or especially on greenfield projects, you're going to end up with all sorts of mishmashes of stuff.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, oh, this time it decided it wanted to react, but last time it used Vue.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Now I have to know two frameworks.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Why am I doing this, right?

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.880
<v Michael Kennedy>There are a bunch of engineering practices and tools to apply to this stuff

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:31.000
<v Michael Kennedy>to get much more constrained, uniform output out of it

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Michael Kennedy>than just letting it go free, right?

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:37.040
<v Michael Kennedy>And also, to Martin's defense, he says, like, look, this is not vibe coding.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.380
<v Michael Kennedy>This is not just letting the thing go.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.000
<v Michael Kennedy>This is, like, engineer plus these tools, right?

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, human in the loop all the way.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Brian Okken>And even if we can get like your expert engineers at your company to work twice as fast, like get twice as much productivity out of them, and they're going to actually be happier because they're, it's like they've got a second brain working with them.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.320
<v Brian Okken>Even 2x like is incredible to get.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.340
<v Brian Okken>It's incredible.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.020
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.040
<v Brian Okken>To get your best engineers to get to figure out stuff faster.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:17.900
<v Brian Okken>Also, even not generating code, but even just having stuff explain it to you, like how does this algorithm work?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.840
<v Brian Okken>What should I care about?

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.200
<v Brian Okken>Asking it what tests you should write, asking it where the problem areas might be.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:33.320
<v Brian Okken>Those are incredible things that we couldn't do before without trying to pull other people off of their own projects.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.160
<v Michael Kennedy>So two more thoughts before we wrap this up quickly.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.199
<v Michael Kennedy>down at the bottom here, talks about...

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Hold on before I lose track of where I was.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, Greenfield.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, so one objection.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.160
<v Michael Kennedy>It's just not in a header sort of thing.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.840
<v Michael Kennedy>One objection that I hear a lot is LLMs are only good at Greenfield projects.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.680
<v Michael Kennedy>And you were kind of talking about that as well, Brian.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.380
<v Michael Kennedy>But I actually strongly disagree with this based on my experience.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.840
<v Michael Kennedy>And so does Martin, by the way.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.280
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I do too.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.440
<v Michael Kennedy>I think when you turn an agentic LLM loose on a Greenfield project,

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Michael Kennedy>it just does whatever is popular on the internet that it's done

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.100
<v Michael Kennedy>or it thinks it's trained on or whatever.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.260
<v Michael Kennedy>When you turn it loose on a Greenfield project,

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.520
<v Michael Kennedy>if you're careful and you set up the guidelines,

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.699
<v Michael Kennedy>it can follow the same patterns that are already established in the code

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.700
<v Michael Kennedy>and use the same libraries and use the same techniques.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.580
<v Michael Kennedy>And I just used, I spent, I would say probably an hour

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.740
<v Michael Kennedy>coming up with a prompt to do a security review

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.640
<v Michael Kennedy>for some of my code.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.980
<v Michael Kennedy>An hour before I started, even before I tried that,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.780
<v Michael Kennedy>working on exactly what I wanted it to do,

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.620
<v Michael Kennedy>how I wanted to do it, how I wanted to go about fixing it.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:14.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And I got what looks like top-tier security pen testing analysis on a code base,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.760
<v Michael Kennedy>and I thought, that is awesome.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.900
<v Michael Kennedy>And that's because it was not a Greenfield project.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:24.460
<v Michael Kennedy>It was thousands and thousands of lines of code that had been around for a long time

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Michael Kennedy>with established patterns of solving things, and it was very, very, very good.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Michael Kennedy>So, yeah, I would like to put it out in the world that that is when done right.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.740
<v Michael Kennedy>That is not, I think Greenfield projects are less good, not better.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Because they have nothing to go on, right?

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.440
<v Michael Kennedy>They just go on whatever they feel like.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.400
<v Brian Okken>I haven't really done a lot of Greenfield on stuff.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.240
<v Brian Okken>I think Greenfield for, for throwaway code or for just like,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Brian Okken>like scripts that you, it just has to get the job done,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.320
<v Brian Okken>sort of the internal thing.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.059
<v Brian Okken>I think those are fine, but gosh,

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Brian Okken>I had an incredible recent experience with just getting stuck

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:12.360
<v Brian Okken>on an algorithm that was too slow and uh i spent an hour with an llm uh and an agent um trying to

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:21.280
<v Brian Okken>get it faster and it was like an intense hour you know yeah exactly and then i just threw it in a

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:27.300
<v Brian Okken>branch and slept on it and came back the next day and made spent another hour trying to make sure i

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Brian Okken>understood all of it and i and um and tweaking it more there were some non-pythonic things that i

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Brian Okken>I got rid of it had recursion in there and I'm like, let's get rid of that.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.180
<v Brian Okken>And we actually made it faster than we did before. So spending a, like, don't,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.180
<v Brian Okken>don't stop with it works,

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Brian Okken>go a little bit further to make sure that you can maintain it in the future.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Brian Okken>It doesn't take that much extra time and you're going to still be proud of it.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.580
<v Brian Okken>And it was an incredible experience. I'm definitely going to do that again.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Michael Kennedy>So, yeah, definitely should be partners. Like a, like a super excited coding buddy,

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.580
<v Michael Kennedy>not just a junior.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Michael Kennedy>You just send stuff to you and make it go.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.500
<v Brian Okken>But I also spent some time, an hour recently or two,

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.280
<v Brian Okken>reviewing some test code from a junior developer.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:18.480
<v Brian Okken>And I, obviously, this stuff was just spit out by an agent.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.880
<v Brian Okken>And it didn't make sense.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.300
<v Brian Okken>And so it just took time away from me to review bad code.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Brian Okken>And that's going to take away from your experts as well.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:31.960
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.200
<v Brian Okken>That's a very good point.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.760
<v Michael Kennedy>It is indeed.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Brian Okken>All right.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Brian Okken>We should have a warning or something about that, Brian.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.120
<v Brian Okken>A warning.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:39.520
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.660
<v Brian Okken>So last episode, we talked about deprecation warnings.

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:48.240
<v Brian Okken>And I have to admit, I didn't do enough research on that.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.300
<v Brian Okken>So I'm glad that listeners chimed in.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.720
<v Brian Okken>We got a couple of listener feedbacks.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.340
<v Brian Okken>One of them, I'm going to credit because we got his email right up here, John Hagan.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:03.460
<v Brian Okken>mentioned you should totally use from warnings import deprecated and do instead of calling your

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:11.180
<v Brian Okken>own calling warn use the decorator deprecated and i totally now after playing with it totally agree

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:16.880
<v Brian Okken>it's awesome so let's uh back up a little bit we started with this um seth larson article about

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.099
<v Brian Okken>deprecations via warnings don't work for python libraries and i kind of agree after experimenting

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:30.820
<v Brian Okken>because um uh i played with it a bit and one of the things that i i found out was um in so in the

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.440
<v Brian Okken>python documentation one of the things that's cool somebody mentioned this and i i didn't really know

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:42.380
<v Brian Okken>about it is development mode so there's dash x dev and you can also set it with a python dev mode

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:49.119
<v Brian Okken>environmental variable and um and it sets a bunch of stuff including setting the default warnings to

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Brian Okken>w and the reason why that's important i'm like why why is that important the reason is it is important

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.140
<v Brian Okken>in seth alludes to it but doesn't point it out directly is in the uh dash wr argument for python

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:09.500
<v Brian Okken>you could say just ignore like ignore all warnings and i think it's just you can either ignore all

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.560
<v Brian Okken>warnings or it even tells you for example to ignore all your deprecation warnings do this

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:21.900
<v Brian Okken>ouch i'm i kind of wish they hadn't mentioned that it i don't encourage people come on don't

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:28.220
<v Brian Okken>encourage people instead of ignore somebody else um and then again sorry for whoever mentioned this

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:36.700
<v Brian Okken>but somebody mentioned um uh just use once ignore like w dash w once makes any warning in your code

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.320
<v Brian Okken>show up once and not a whole bunch of times and and it's the whole bunch of times that i think

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.820
<v Brian Okken>people turn it off for because it fills up your CI logs and everything like that.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.680
<v Brian Okken>But you really should see it at least once.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.620
<v Brian Okken>I like the once.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.020
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what else I like about once?

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.640
<v Michael Kennedy>The W once is the pronunciation is the same as just once.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Brian Okken>That's just once.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:55.560
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:56.900
<v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.260
<v Brian Okken>So I played with it.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.060
<v Brian Okken>I looked at this deprecation warning thing.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.860
<v Brian Okken>And we'll link to the documentation in Python as well.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.700
<v Brian Okken>But you can do it, combine both solutions, which I love.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.960
<v Brian Okken>So you can just go ahead and declare your own warning and use the deprecated.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.100
<v Brian Okken>And so I tried this out.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.800
<v Brian Okken>So what you do is you just say create your own just a class and derive it from user warning.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.140
<v Brian Okken>And you don't have to import anything for this.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.180
<v Brian Okken>This is just built in.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.980
<v Brian Okken>It doesn't have to do anything, just a passing class.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:49.660
<v Brian Okken>But then if you use this deprecated decorator and pass your new warning category as deprecated,

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.820
<v Brian Okken>and this sounds complicated on the air, it's not.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.500
<v Brian Okken>We'll do a code example.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Brian Okken>But what you get is this, I had it, warning, both.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.500
<v Brian Okken>Oh, yeah, it's over just right on the same screenshot.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.860
<v Brian Okken>The cool thing is that mypy and other type checkers,

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.220
<v Brian Okken>when you use the deprecated, will flag that it's a problem.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.560
<v Brian Okken>And I was doing it.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.280
<v Brian Okken>I think PyCharm does the same thing, but I was doing it in VS Code.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.540
<v Brian Okken>And what happens if you've got this deprecated decorator

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.820
<v Brian Okken>is that the IDE will just cross it out.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.800
<v Brian Okken>And they're like, why is this crossed out?

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.660
<v Brian Okken>And if you hover over it, it'll say, oh, this is deprecated.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.200
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, it's like a strikethrough.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Brian Okken>It says, don't use it.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.560
<v Brian Okken>I love it.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.760
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, it's very visual, and it will make you look at it.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:46.500
<v Brian Okken>So I think that instead of just calling mourn, yeah, please use the deprecated.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.760
<v Brian Okken>And then I was playing with pytest as well.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.640
<v Brian Okken>And what did we get?

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.760
<v Brian Okken>I wrote it down in the show notes.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.420
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, you want to pass in the dash W, just like you would for Python.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:08.900
<v Brian Okken>If you do dash W error within pytest, at least in one of your tests to find out actually all of the tests.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.880
<v Brian Okken>So that'll turn.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Brian Okken>Well, even by default, pytest will warn you and do the warnings.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.080
<v Brian Okken>But if you're in CI, maybe you're not watching those.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:25.280
<v Brian Okken>So in CI, having a check for those deprecation warnings with dash W error will flag all those failures.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.760
<v Brian Okken>So anyway, lots of great information from readers.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.580
<v Michael Kennedy>So thank you for listeners.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.660
<v Michael Kennedy>We got, if they read the newsletter you send, they could be readers.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, they could be readers.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.780
<v Michael Kennedy>John pointed out that you can set an environment variable.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:54.680
<v Michael Kennedy>And people may be hesitant to just set an environment variable for their computer to turn Python into like dev mode, you know, which makes it slower potentially.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:03.600
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you create a virtual environment, which you should be doing, there's an activation script in that virtual environment.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:13.540
<v Michael Kennedy>And you can just go and export that environment variable set to debug or whatever mode you want to set it to.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:13.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, yeah.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Only when you activate that virtual environment.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.040
<v Michael Kennedy>So if you're on a particular project, you're like, this one really, I don't care about speed right now.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.300
<v Michael Kennedy>I just care about getting things right.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.540
<v Michael Kennedy>like tweak its virtual environment,

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.780
<v Michael Kennedy>that doesn't have really many knock-on effects.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.860
<v Michael Kennedy>So that's a cool hack, I think.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.380
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, it's a great place to throw in temporary pytest flags as well

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Brian Okken>or any runtime flags.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:36.420
<v Brian Okken>Exactly.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Brian Okken>It's not just about this dev thing.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.340
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like a little shell script, basically.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:42.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Indeed.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.160
<v Michael Kennedy>You could do it for open source things, Brian.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.220
<v Michael Kennedy>I love open source.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.760
<v Michael Kennedy>So, yeah.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:51.860
<v Michael Kennedy>So here's another article.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.780
<v Michael Kennedy>and this one is by Thomas Dupree called How FOSS One and Why It Matters.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.740
<v Michael Kennedy>This is a pretty interesting article.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Michael Kennedy>And what it looks at open source, free and open source software angle from

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.100
<v Michael Kennedy>is not just why do people like writing open source software,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.880
<v Michael Kennedy>why do they like it better than having locked away software

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.920
<v Michael Kennedy>or having to pay or having bugs you can't fix

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.020
<v Michael Kennedy>or black box security issues potentially.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Though as we've seen lately, open source has its whole supply chain story on that.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.420
<v Michael Kennedy>That's different in a different way.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:36.320
<v Michael Kennedy>But anyway, it really looks at it from why has it won from a company perspective, especially large companies.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:37.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.060
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's really interesting.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:45.100
<v Michael Kennedy>So it says like, look, why did it win?

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, people want to pay less.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.680
<v Michael Kennedy>So paying less, aka free software, that's great, right?

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, how do companies make more money?

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Michael Kennedy>They either make more profit or they have fewer expenses for a fixed level of profit.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.140
<v Michael Kennedy>So not paying for software is great.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.620
<v Michael Kennedy>But that's not just open source software.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.960
<v Michael Kennedy>That's for everything.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Michael Kennedy>And so companies implement what's called cost control.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:15.680
<v Michael Kennedy>It's a business term for making buying things painful, hard, and time-consuming as possible.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.960
<v Michael Kennedy>So employees will either not or hate doing it.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.020
<v Michael Kennedy>So an example is like, hey, I need a cool date picker for our site.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Imagine open source doesn't exist.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:35.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, someone's going to have to start by creating a ticket to get this date picker.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.760
<v Michael Kennedy>And then, well, we have to research the various commercial options.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.960
<v Michael Kennedy>We could go to procurement and have them find it.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Michael Kennedy>but what do they know about date pickers?

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.180
<v Michael Kennedy>So we're gonna do that ourself.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.380
<v Michael Kennedy>We're gonna just get a report.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.680
<v Michael Kennedy>We're gonna bring it to procurement.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.400
<v Michael Kennedy>And when we get there, then procurement says, okay, great.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.100
<v Michael Kennedy>You're gonna go with this company, fine.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:59.200
<v Michael Kennedy>So what we're gonna do is first,

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.640
<v Michael Kennedy>we're gonna need to set up a vendor agreement with them

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.900
<v Michael Kennedy>'cause it turns out they're not currently a vendor of ours.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.340
<v Michael Kennedy>So we have contracts, we have reviews,

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.120
<v Michael Kennedy>we have negotiations, all for a stupid date picker, right?

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.580
<v Michael Kennedy>It's just like, what is going on?

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.900
<v Michael Kennedy>And then on top of it, there's all these copyright laws, like indemnification of

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.440
<v Michael Kennedy>like you prove you haven't stolen from another company than to resell this to

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.660
<v Michael Kennedy>me and like some other way and all of that stuff.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:30.320
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, eventually you get permission to buy the thing and then you could start

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:30.720
<v Michael Kennedy>using it.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.360
<v Michael Kennedy>So open source software enters the scene.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.660
<v Michael Kennedy>It says this comes with a pre-agreed pre-reviewed license, MIT, Apache, whatever.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.800
<v Michael Kennedy>And so the lawyers are already like, yep, we know what that is.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.740
<v Michael Kennedy>We know how to deal with that.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Michael Kennedy>There's no pain, so there's no vendor research, vendor approval, contracts, copyright, all that kind of stuff.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:26:01.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And so it really, interestingly, is this hack to skip around this, like, make buying stuff at companies super hard.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:02.440
<v Michael Kennedy>You're right?

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.680
<v Brian Okken>It wasn't always that way, though.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.160
<v Brian Okken>It took a long time for companies to realize that open source was fine.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes, that's for sure.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.220
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, they did have to work through it.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:19.860
<v Michael Kennedy>But I think once they kind of, it feels like they had to go through this same process we're kind of describing once in a sort of an abstract sense.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, okay, then, well, now you can just go.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:22.620
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.240
<v Michael Kennedy>It says, hey, look, it also works both ways.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:40.080
<v Michael Kennedy>If you're a FOSS maintainer, the miracle of your software bypassing copyright laws and liabilities and procurement means that you can get your software out there and have people use it pretty easy, right?

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:40.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Because.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:41.820
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.120
<v Michael Kennedy>your stuff is much easier to adopt because it's open source.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.440
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, I've been on the vendor side of these negotiations and paperwork

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.300
<v Michael Kennedy>and accounting and legal more than once.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.360
<v Michael Kennedy>And it sucks.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Michael Kennedy>It sucks.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.600
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, look, hey, people want to put me in as a vendor and buy stuff.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm here for it.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.780
<v Michael Kennedy>But at the same time, it is not fun, right?

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.380
<v Michael Kennedy>There needs to be, like, if you're just a hobbyist, like, well, no.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:06.620
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.759
<v Michael Kennedy>So the final bit of this article, the final bit of this thought piece

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:11.740
<v Michael Kennedy>is you can't go back.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:21.080
<v Michael Kennedy>So if we're trying to solve the sustainability of open source software,

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:25.060
<v Michael Kennedy>you have to keep in mind one of the main reasons it's so popular

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.260
<v Michael Kennedy>is it skipped the copyright rule stuff.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.100
<v Michael Kennedy>It skipped the vendor onboarding and all these things.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:38.780
<v Michael Kennedy>So if your solution to fix sustainability is to recreate any of the supply chain framework problem,

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.500
<v Michael Kennedy>your solution is dead on arrival. So I think that's what this is why I wanted to bring up

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Michael Kennedy>this article. I put it at the end of the year. It's kind of like,

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.400
<v Michael Kennedy>I would love to see more sustainability options for open source. But I do think that this guy

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.980
<v Michael Kennedy>is onto something here. I do think that Thomas is onto something with his

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.659
<v Michael Kennedy>skipping the legal, skipping the procurement. And if we put it back and say, well, you got to set

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.620
<v Michael Kennedy>up a vendor agreement with us again, then you're unraveling a lot of the things that made it

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:13.520
<v Michael Kennedy>a really good fit.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:15.800
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:23.360
<v Michael Kennedy>The article does a lot more detailed explanation than I did, but they're for people to think

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:23.660
<v Michael Kennedy>about.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.380
<v Brian Okken>I hope this, yeah, I hope we don't go back.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.240
<v Brian Okken>There are pressures to push it back.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.380
<v Brian Okken>Like you were saying, there's the projects that just can't –

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.260
<v Brian Okken>they know the enterprise is using it and they're not getting paid,

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.220
<v Brian Okken>and that isn't a Zip Armour.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.820
<v Brian Okken>And if you're not charging anything, you can't just make it up in volume.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.680
<v Brian Okken>We've tripled our revenue from what it was last year.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.180
<v Brian Okken>Still zero.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:58.320
<v Brian Okken>With things like trying to secure the supply chain,

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:04.400
<v Brian Okken>We are. I mean, even open source is part of the supply chain, whether or not you want to believe it is.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:13.560
<v Brian Okken>And so there are pressures to, you know, put SBOMs on or the software bill of materials to verify all your subcomponents and all that stuff.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:21.020
<v Brian Okken>Python is helping to make that easier for individual maintainers of projects, which is cool.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:24.260
<v Brian Okken>But it's still some extra work.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:28.560
<v Brian Okken>And I don't think it's fair that maintainers are having to do that work.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.000
<v Brian Okken>and they don't benefit from it.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:31.840
<v Brian Okken>The companies benefit.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:39.000
<v Brian Okken>And we do need to find a way to get money to vendors better

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.120
<v Brian Okken>or money to contributors.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.240
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I 100% agree.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:43.820
<v Brian Okken>I do.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.100
<v Michael Kennedy>But, yeah.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.560
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't have a great direct, like, force them to do it type of answer.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.500
<v Michael Kennedy>But, yeah.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Hopefully, many of them will see, like, hey, we benefit from this thing.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Michael Kennedy>if we were a major sponsor of this project,

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.780
<v Michael Kennedy>we could have the ear of the maintainer team

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:06.900
<v Michael Kennedy>to get the thing that we really want.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.720
<v Michael Kennedy>I think that's a possibility.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.140
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, there might also be some maintenance agreement

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.080
<v Brian Okken>sort of stuff.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.940
<v Brian Okken>It's definitely open source,

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:22.420
<v Brian Okken>but also whoever the main maintainer is

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.460
<v Brian Okken>for a small fee,

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.600
<v Brian Okken>promising to look at your defect reports or things like that.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:37.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, there's this whole productized consulting sort of thing I think would be pretty good,

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:42.600
<v Michael Kennedy>where it's like, basically, I'm going to pay you a retainer, and you have a certain amount of

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Michael Kennedy>credits you can redeem that expire at the end of the month for me to potentially come and do

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:52.559
<v Michael Kennedy>exactly what you're suggesting. And if you don't use it, that's fine, but I'm here at the drop of a

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.340
<v Michael Kennedy>hat if you need me, sort of. You pay me $5,000 a month and I may or may not have to work for you

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:03.240
<v Michael Kennedy>that month, but you know what? That'd be good. But at the very least, or even having lower ones

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:10.320
<v Brian Okken>so more people do it and to make sure that things are actually stayed maintained because there's a

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.680
<v Brian Okken>lot of stuff that's just done and you can't tell whether or not it's really maintained. Anyway.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's 100%.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.300
<v Michael Kennedy>100%.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.180
<v Michael Kennedy>In fact, you might even want to go and find just a complete, like, I'm not even putting

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Michael Kennedy>on GitHub anymore.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.740
<v Michael Kennedy>That's how much I'm changing my mind about open source.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:36.120
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, so this next topic was going to be about looking for GitHub alternatives.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:42.240
<v Brian Okken>And so I just left it as the title is, should I be looking for GitHub alternatives?

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.020
<v Brian Okken>And why am I talking about that?

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:44.980
<v Brian Okken>I mean, GitHub's awesome.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:45.480
<v Brian Okken>Why would you?

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.220
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, I think it's great.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.000
<v Brian Okken>I'm still happy with GitHub.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.580
<v Brian Okken>But they sort of fumbled recently.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.380
<v Brian Okken>Did you hear about all this, Michael?

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:55.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes, with the billing?

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:57.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, yes, I heard about it.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.980
<v Michael Kennedy>So what happened?

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:06.440
<v Michael Kennedy>What bothers me more even is the clear lack of craftsmanship and care around the code that runs.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.160
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, you get janky code and we're going to charge you.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, and our bug is also going to sometimes make it run for hours and then we'll charge you still for that too.

00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:22.340
<v Brian Okken>yeah so there's some pricing changes and the message pricing changes and they like released

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:28.220
<v Brian Okken>it on december 15th and then they i think and then just recently updated it i can't i don't

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:34.820
<v Brian Okken>know when the update was on oh the original announcement was on the 16th um there's an

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:41.820
<v Brian Okken>update to it so they um they have actions it's way popular than they thought it would be and

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:47.500
<v Brian Okken>actually like just tons of people just switched from and it happened it is similar a lot of times

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:52.940
<v Brian Okken>where people were like travis was imploding so people were trying to uh leave travis and were

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:59.060
<v Brian Okken>like oh you have actions this year let's just use that um that's part of it um but and it also

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:06.999
<v Brian Okken>benefited github a lot a lot of projects um you know started using using it more however um i get

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.020
<v Brian Okken>that they have to pay for that compute somehow.

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.520
<v Brian Okken>However, they've said, let's see,

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:18.180
<v Brian Okken>they're going to have GitHub or hosted runners

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.760
<v Brian Okken>are going to reduce their price by 39%.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.620
<v Brian Okken>And I actually didn't realize that they were charging

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.660
<v Brian Okken>because apparently I don't use it enough

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.520
<v Brian Okken>to get billed for it.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.980
<v Brian Okken>But in the announcement,

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:35.120
<v Brian Okken>they also said that you can see the non-hosted runners.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:42.380
<v Brian Okken>So like the code that you've got your own computer set up to run your stuff, they were going to charge for that too.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.360
<v Brian Okken>Look, I think that's insane.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.640
<v Brian Okken>It was not a lot.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.700
<v Brian Okken>It was like two tenths of a cent per minute or something like that.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:59.500
<v Brian Okken>But that's like, it's just sitting there waiting for your GitHub runner, your Git runner to finish.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.100
<v Brian Okken>Why would they charge for that?

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:01.980
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, I don't know.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.520
<v Brian Okken>There's been a change.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.480
<v Brian Okken>So we're going to link to the announcement of the pricing change.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.540
<v Brian Okken>I didn't get too much into the details of the pricing change,

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.700
<v Brian Okken>but it's kind of weird to charge the same amount for both,

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.240
<v Brian Okken>whether or not you're using a hosted runner or your own runner.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.179
<v Brian Okken>That's weird.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Brian Okken>So they've actually backed off.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:29.780
<v Brian Okken>So they're going to postpone the billing for the self-hosted.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.860
<v Brian Okken>They didn't say they're going to not do it, though.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:32.800
<v Michael Kennedy>It's just postponing.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:33.399
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it's weird.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:41.220
<v Michael Kennedy>So I get the argument like, wow, we thought we'd have to buy 100 computers and we're on our 100,000th VM.

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.700
<v Michael Kennedy>We've set up this as a little out of control.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.919
<v Michael Kennedy>That doesn't apply to self-hosted.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.780
<v Brian Okken>Well, I mean, the actions are still running, so they're not really charging that much for the actions.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:35:00.120
<v Brian Okken>Just the, I mean, all the rest of the stuff is mostly coming for free.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.040
<v Brian Okken>It's just.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Right, right.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.660
<v Michael Kennedy>But I mean, if you have a self-hosted GitHub Action runner,

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.060
<v Michael Kennedy>they're not paying for the compute to run it

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.260
<v Michael Kennedy>because you're running on whatever you're self-hosting.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.260
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.040
<v Brian Okken>Like maybe, and if they are having to,

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.060
<v Brian Okken>I mean, they have to have something that sits around

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.320
<v Brian Okken>and like waits for it or something.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:17.820
<v Brian Okken>I don't know.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.100
<v Brian Okken>But figure out how to do that way cheaper.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.300
<v Brian Okken>It should be like super cheap.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.300
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, because that's like,

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.680
<v Brian Okken>that's one of the reasons why people have their own runner

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.220
<v Brian Okken>is to save on compute.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:51.820
<v Brian Okken>So, yeah, that was weird. So I went ahead and like, you know, why not look at other stuff? So let's look at some other. That's the warning thing. Some other alternatives. So there I found this article. I just searched for it. There's a four GitHub alternatives that are just as good or better. And there's some that I hadn't heard of. So this is kind of fun.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.000
<v Brian Okken>I hadn't heard of Codeberg.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:59.120
<v Brian Okken>So nonprofit community-led effort that provides Git hosting

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.980
<v Brian Okken>and other services for free and open source projects.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.940
<v Brian Okken>Okay, so it's not for private projects or something,

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Brian Okken>but there's a lot here.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.460
<v Brian Okken>So maybe something to look into.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.840
<v Brian Okken>But I don't think that GitHub is charging that much

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.780
<v Brian Okken>for open source either or anyway.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.920
<v Brian Okken>But it's fun to look at some of these alternatives.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.960
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, I think Codeberg only lets you have open source.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Just only what opens.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:23.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.800
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like free.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Almost got to apply to a joint sort of thing.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.580
<v Michael Kennedy>If I remember like you.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:29.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:29.740
<v Brian Okken>So,

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:30.900
<v Brian Okken>and then Bitbucket.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:31.500
<v Brian Okken>I mean,

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.520
<v Brian Okken>like I didn't,

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.540
<v Brian Okken>I guess I forgot it's around.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.400
<v Brian Okken>Sorry.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I did too.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.400
<v Michael Kennedy>I use source tree all the time,

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:39.360
<v Michael Kennedy>which was,

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.200
<v Michael Kennedy>I believe made sort of as the front end of Bitbucket.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.020
<v Michael Kennedy>If you want to do something.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:44.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.520
<v Michael Kennedy>And still I forgot Bitbucket exists.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.000
<v Brian Okken>So Bitbucket.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:51.320
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:55.600
<v Brian Okken>it's not, I, oldest established competitor of GitHub.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.280
<v Brian Okken>I think it predates GitHub. I'm not sure, but it,

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:02.840
<v Brian Okken>oh, launched around the same time in 2008. It's still maintained.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.640
<v Brian Okken>It's still there. So you can, 

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.880
<v Brian Okken>and the interface is a lot better than it was way back in the 2008,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.960
<v Brian Okken>nine, 10 timeframe when I was using it, but, bit bucket GitLab.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:18.760
<v Brian Okken>And actually GitLab is a solid alternative. I use a GitLab at work. And,

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:28.100
<v Brian Okken>um the thing that yeah i like it lab uh definitely a an option to look into it uh get

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:35.380
<v Brian Okken>yeah g g-i-t-e-a haven't heard of this before but it's around as well and then while i was looking

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:41.580
<v Brian Okken>around for this i also came up came around some comments on socials about tangled it's an

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Brian Okken>alpha it's a new it's a new thing it came out this year i think um a uh tightly knit social coding

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:57.920
<v Brian Okken>so they're really trying to um and they're launching as a lightweight lightweight github

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:04.200
<v Brian Okken>repo get repo hosting but the way they're dealing with it i think is the pipelines and

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:10.180
<v Brian Okken>the runs are running uh i don't know if they have runners in the cloud i think it looks like um they

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.620
<v Brian Okken>they're mainly trying to get you to run your own runners.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.560
<v Brian Okken>So it's interesting.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:16.900
<v Brian Okken>I could be wrong,

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.060
<v Brian Okken>but there are definitely some different options around there

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.140
<v Brian Okken>if you really do want to get off GitHub.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:27.580
<v Brian Okken>I like GitLab and GitHub mostly.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.740
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm always tempted to do some self-hosted thing,

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.680
<v Michael Kennedy>and I love the idea of it so much.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:34.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.700
<v Michael Kennedy>So I have to talk myself off the ledge periodically.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:43.020
<v Michael Kennedy>And if you're doing something just for you,

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.580
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it's cool to pick something based on features, right?

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Or some kind of philosophy of the company,

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.320
<v Michael Kennedy>like this one is only open source or this one is super privacy

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.060
<v Michael Kennedy>or this one is European-based or whatever, right?

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.920
<v Michael Kennedy>However, if you're doing open source

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.900
<v Michael Kennedy>and you actually want it to be used by people,

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.260
<v Michael Kennedy>there's no other option than GitHub.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:16.020
<v Brian Okken>Well, okay. If you, I think if you, if you really want people to interact with it, get up and, and contribute.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.520
<v Brian Okken>I mean, contributors. Yes, exactly.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:33.360
<v Brian Okken>And file defects and, and, you know, all that sort of stuff, GitHub. But I've seen a lot of projects that a lot of the community is just like complaining or either complaining or asking for features that aren't even part of it.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:41.820
<v Brian Okken>So like you're doing, basically, if you don't want interact, if you want people to use it, it needs to be on PyPI for Python.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Brian Okken>But if you really don't want people to file defects and contribute junk, yeah, I think switching to GitLab or something like that totally makes sense.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:40:02.800
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, it's like saying, I don't like that Twitter went away, so I'm going to set up my own private social media and then invite my friends to join.

00:40:04.959 --> 00:40:06.420
<v Michael Kennedy>they probably are not going to come.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.220
<v Michael Kennedy>If they do, they're probably going to not visit it after three days.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:09.720
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Even though these things are awesome and GetUp is being not ideal in some ways,

00:40:17.279 --> 00:40:20.040
<v Michael Kennedy>the truth of social stuff is you've got to be where the people are.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Otherwise, it's tough to work with.

00:40:23.779 --> 00:40:26.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, that's mostly a note to myself in the future.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:26.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway.

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:27.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:29.560
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Michael Kennedy>How are we feeling about extras?

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.360
<v Michael Kennedy>I have a couple extras, but why don't you go?

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, let's talk about PyCharm for a second.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.840
<v Michael Kennedy>So I'm a big fan of Rough, no doubt about that.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.680
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm also a fan of Pyrefly, which I've been using a lot lately,

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.020
<v Michael Kennedy>and ty, which I believe ty just went into beta.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Shouldn't that be one of our items?

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I believe it should be if I haven't covered it.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.620
<v Michael Kennedy>But ty, the one from Astral,

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.880
<v Michael Kennedy>that is sort of the high-performance companion

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.900
<v Michael Kennedy>and our frenemy of Pyrefly.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.060
<v Michael Kennedy>They both are now in beta mode.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And with the latest release of PyCharm,

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.860
<v Michael Kennedy>it expands its LSP support

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.620
<v Michael Kennedy>so that it has native integration for Ruff, ty,

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.760
<v Michael Kennedy>and Pyrefly plus PyRite.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.220
<v Michael Kennedy>And this news comes to us from Daniel Muldmer,

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:23.940
<v Michael Kennedy>if I haven't said so.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.080
<v Michael Kennedy>So thanks, Dean, for sending that in.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.940
<v Michael Kennedy>And there's actually a whole link,

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.860
<v Michael Kennedy>a page which I'll link to about the LSP

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.560
<v Michael Kennedy>support and how you turn that on if you want.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.440
<v Michael Kennedy>So you can have like native rough integration and so on.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.240
<v Michael Kennedy>So anyway, shout out, shout out to that.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Also rough page has a setup for how to do it in reverse.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Brian Okken>The LSP being for language servers always throws me.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.700
<v Brian Okken>So I'm like, by the time now supports Lisp, but that's weird.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:51.680
<v Michael Kennedy>I know.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Also, it feels redundant and LSP server.

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Like it's already a language server.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.720
<v Michael Kennedy>I guess a language server protocol server.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Shouldn't it just be a language server?

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:10.680
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like saying it's an HTTP website or something.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:11.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.720
<v Michael Kennedy>I feel like the name is all the best.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.300
<v Michael Kennedy>It's HTTP protocol.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:15.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Right.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.560
<v Michael Kennedy>It's an HTTP protocol website that you access with your browser now.

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:19.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:20.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Last thing.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:26.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I didn't save the link to this, but I thought this was a fun.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.300
<v Michael Kennedy>I saw this on X Twitter, and it's just like a little sign off.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.240
<v Michael Kennedy>like sort of wishing you well or like take care until next time I see you.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.040
<v Michael Kennedy>But here's the developer version.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.760
<v Michael Kennedy>May your bug tracker be forever empty.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:41.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, nice.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:42.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, very nice.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.580
<v Michael Kennedy>It's a little bit of a play on Hunger Games, I believe.

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.020
<v Michael Kennedy>May the odds be forever in your favor, you know, that sort of thing.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.740
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, and like I was saying, if you really want your bug tracker to be empty,

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.240
<v Brian Okken>move it away from GitHub.

00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:57.540
<v Brian Okken>Yep.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Brian Okken>A couple things.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:07.800
<v Brian Okken>Just a reminder to people, I am taking the rest of December off from updates to the Lean TDD book.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:14.500
<v Brian Okken>But this is an attempt to explain to people how to actually get productivity gains from test-driven development.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.300
<v Brian Okken>But I'll pick it up in January.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.580
<v Brian Okken>I'm hoping actually to finish the entire first draft in January.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.180
<v Brian Okken>That's the goal.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.920
<v Brian Okken>That's an aggressive goal.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.020
<v Brian Okken>But I have all the stuff I want to do, so we'll see.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:27.280
<v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:35.260
<v Brian Okken>Finally, the pytest course, I just had somebody ask me this morning, sent me an email and said, hey, I bought the book.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.780
<v Brian Okken>I love the Python Testament pytest book.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.040
<v Brian Okken>And I'd like the course.

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:40.760
<v Brian Okken>Can I get a discount?

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.900
<v Brian Okken>And I just love people that just ask.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:49.200
<v Brian Okken>So I gave them a discount, of course, but also so you can always email and ask.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:55.240
<v Brian Okken>But I also just decided to throw a 50% off sale for the Christmas time.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.760
<v Brian Okken>So last minute Christmas shopping for yourself.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.900
<v Brian Okken>if you I'll put this in the show notes but if you use the code

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:01.960
<v Brian Okken>Xmas

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.340
<v Brian Okken>XMAS 2025

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.540
<v Brian Okken>I'll give you 50% off

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.960
<v Michael Kennedy>so

00:44:07.859 --> 00:44:10.420
<v Michael Kennedy>very very nice and I'm looking forward to a more

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.340
<v Michael Kennedy>efficient and error

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.080
<v Michael Kennedy>free 2026

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:15.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Christmas after

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Rudolph and team

00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:19.760
<v Michael Kennedy>use your discount

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.760
<v Michael Kennedy>learn test driven better

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.200
<v Michael Kennedy>and then you know next

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.400
<v Michael Kennedy>year round their deliveries will be more error free

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.200
<v Michael Kennedy>You're doing a service for all the kids.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:32.700
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.160
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Over to a couple of funny things.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.460
<v Michael Kennedy>We do.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.860
<v Michael Kennedy>One is mine, one is yours.

00:44:38.699 --> 00:44:40.800
<v Michael Kennedy>So what if you have errors in your code?

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, that's what structured error handling is for.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Exceptions, try, catch, try, accept, depending on your language.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.720
<v Michael Kennedy>But what do you do when the error happens, Brian?

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.680
<v Michael Kennedy>What do you do when the error happens?

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.540
<v Michael Kennedy>One possibility is to log it.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.220
<v Michael Kennedy>You gotta already have your login set up.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.660
<v Michael Kennedy>So, you know, there's a few steps.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:01.700
<v Michael Kennedy>I guess you could print it.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.620
<v Michael Kennedy>That's a bit of a help.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe you just have a beep, play the beep sound

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.120
<v Michael Kennedy>when an exception happens, I don't know.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:14.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, this person decided to write a simple two-liner.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.180
<v Michael Kennedy>And this is in JavaScript in the example,

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.620
<v Michael Kennedy>but it could be just as well in Python.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.440
<v Michael Kennedy>It says, if I catch an exception,

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.560
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm going to create a string that's

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.380
<v Michael Kennedy>HTTP colon slash slash stackoverflow.com slash search

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.440
<v Michael Kennedy>question mark Q equals.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.600
<v Michael Kennedy>And you put the exception message in the end.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.240
<v Michael Kennedy>And then you open a browser to that.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:38.160
<v Brian Okken>Wow.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:38.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Problem solved.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Old school.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:41.680
<v Michael Kennedy>That's old school.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.200
<v Michael Kennedy>I think the modern version is to just call an open AI API.

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.140
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, just ask your agent to run it,

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:53.240
<v Brian Okken>Catch all exceptions and fix it for you with PRs.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:54.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, just feel free to go and auto commit and publish it at production.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.580
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't need to review it.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:45:59.320
<v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:04.540
<v Brian Okken>But be sure to label it with the prompt for that we discussed last week.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:06.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's see.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Any good comments?

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:08.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Is this real?

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:13.180
<v Michael Kennedy>This is hilarious, whether or not this is perfectly fine for local prod as well.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.740
<v Michael Kennedy>As far as I'm concerned, production as in live.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Cutting out the middle, man.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Literally saves a precious three seconds.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.060
<v Michael Kennedy>3.531, actually.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, and someone literally did write a ChatGPT alternative in the comments.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, nice.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:31.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, there you go.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:32.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, perfect.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.040
<v Michael Kennedy>So it even came up with a prompt for you.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.000
<v Michael Kennedy>The following error.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.280
<v Michael Kennedy>It's occurred in my JavaScript application.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Please write code that resolves this issue.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Respond only with code.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:40.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Here's the exception.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:44.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, yeah.

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:44.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Pretty good.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:45.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Pretty good stuff.

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:45.800
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:46.780
<v Michael Kennedy>This one's for you.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:47.400
<v Michael Kennedy>You got it.

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:48.360
<v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.020
<v Brian Okken>So last week, what did we title our podcast episode?

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.120
<v Brian Okken>Something like LinkedIn something?

00:46:55.530 --> 00:47:01.820
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, somebody responded with, oh, LinkedIn Cringe.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:09.140
<v Brian Okken>Somebody called Archtoad said, LinkedIn Cringe made me think of this.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.700
<v Brian Okken>It's AI blockchain kombucha startup.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:19.880
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, this comes from Arctode, referring to a post by Tim Kellogg.

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:26.900
<v Brian Okken>Using Nano Banana prompt, create a super annoying LinkedIn profile, which is amazing.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:35.580
<v Brian Okken>So the profile is great with like a hero image with somebody giving a speech.

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:41.000
<v Brian Okken>and on the screen is disrupt or die, which is great.

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:42.060
<v Brian Okken>Great screen capture.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:43.740
<v Brian Okken>But let's see.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.200
<v Brian Okken>Let's read his profile.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Brian Okken>He's a visionary, 10X growth ninja, chief evangelist at stealth mode,

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Brian Okken>at a stealth mode AI blockchain kombucha startup.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Brian Okken>That's awesome.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.880
<v Brian Okken>Helping Fortune 500 CEOs maximize human synergy.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.280
<v Brian Okken>That means nothing.

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.820
<v Brian Okken>A TEDx speaker applicant.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.740
<v Brian Okken>Not even TED, just like a TEDx.

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.060
<v Brian Okken>Yeah, sure, a TEDx, which is like the original.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.480
<v Brian Okken>I applied to speak.

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.540
<v Brian Okken>I didn't get it, but, you know, I applied.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.200
<v Brian Okken>Forbes 30 under 30 nominee.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:23.980
<v Brian Okken>Oh, my gosh.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.860
<v Brian Okken>A dog dad, coffee addict.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.220
<v Brian Okken>Why are you still reading this?

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:29.920
<v Brian Okken>Let's connect.

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.520
<v Brian Okken>about Brighton doesn't just work.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.260
<v Brian Okken>Brighton shifts paradigms.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.240
<v Brian Okken>That's awesome.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:48.760
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, really good things I'd like to see in a LinkedIn profile.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.480
<v Michael Kennedy>This is pretty good.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.920
<v Michael Kennedy>I didn't realize that this originally came from Nana Banana.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.400
<v Michael Kennedy>I feel like the challenge is on for the follow-ups.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:02.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Pretty amazing.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:03.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Pretty amazing.

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:12.500
<v Brian Okken>Anyway, it's been an amazing run for us and an amazing 2025, I think.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.280
<v Brian Okken>Things are going good.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:21.680
<v Brian Okken>I mean, aside from our entire country imploding, but other than that, things have been going pretty good for you and I.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:30.600
<v Michael Kennedy>It's been a backhanded compliment curse is may you live in interesting times.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, things are interesting.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.780
