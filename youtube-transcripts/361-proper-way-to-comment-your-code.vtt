00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.000
Hey.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.480
Welcome to another lovely Python Bytes episode.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.000
It's good to have you back.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.040
Yeah, good to be back together after a week off.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.720
Let's do it, huh?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.080
Well, let's do it.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.600
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.100

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.680
This is episode 361, recorded November 21st.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.040
And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.440
And I am Michael Kennedy.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.800
And this episode is brought to you by Scout APM.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.800

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.120
Yeah, it's fun to have people be part of the audience.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.640
Not required, certainly.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.360
Not intended to be required, but fun to have them there.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.360
Yeah.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.160
What do you got for us first?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.740
Oh, well, very excited to be back together on the eve of Turkey Day, the Turkey Eve.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.080
So happy Turkey Eve by the eve of the Turkey Eve.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.080
Eve, eve.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960
Eve squared, two eve.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.920
I don't know how this multiplies together.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.460
Let's start talking about something snarky, aka Brett Cannon.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.840
So Brett Cannon did a nice write-up here about different keyboards.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.360
And Brian, I know you're a fan of ergonomic keyboards.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.840
I am definitely a fan of the ergonomic keyboards, having had serious RSI issues at one point

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840
in my career.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.960
Basically, if I type on a laptop keyboard for a week, I'd have to quit.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.320
I mean, quit my job.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.320
I'd be done.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320
It's that bad, right?

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.960
I'm not making it up.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.800
The carpal tunnel stuff is real.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.400
But with the right keyboard, I can literally type 10 hours a day, no problem at all.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.440
So choosing a keyboard is something I wish I'd paid more attention to when I was younger,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.280
but it's super, super important.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.000
And Brett had his nice write-up on it, so that's what I'm going to cover today.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.240
So basically, he says, "Look, here's what I care about.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.600
I have a bunch of different concerns."

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.240
For him, it was more his back that was causing him problems, but he was looking to get a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.960
fully split keyboard.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.880
He went from something kind of like my keyboard, which I'll give a shout-out to in a second,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.720
to a completely split, which means the keyboard, the part your left hand touches and the part

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.000
your right hand touches are not attached, at least not physically, maybe through a wire

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
just so they communicate.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.920
So, well, okay, how do we go?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.240
He talks about all the considerations, all the things that he cares about, and then goes

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.160
through a nice long list of things, right?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.320
What has he used before?

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.880
The requirements are it must be fully split because he's using an ergonomic one that's

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.720
not fully split now, and this is his goal.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.760
It must tent, as in it must, from the two edges, the middle must raise up and down.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.280
So if you rotate your hands, I don't know, like this, without moving your arms at all,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.360
you just left or right, like a clock, that kind of rotation.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.080
And some portability, interestingly, aesthetically pleasing to his wife, because it has to be

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.120
visible and somewhat programmable.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.600
So I don't want to go through his whole article.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.640
I just want to kind of give a shout-out to a bunch of different keyboards and get your

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.320
thoughts as well.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.160
First of all, he says, "Hey, look, I'm using," I think he was using, or at least was considering

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.600
and put it into the category of the Microsoft Surface ergonomic keyboard.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.880
That's a fine looking little keyboard right there.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.040
It's like a full-size keyboard or 100% keyboard where it has the numbers and all of that,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.560
the numpad thing in addition to the numbers on the top, of course.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.160
It's fixed-tented, I guess you would call it, right?

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.980
It's got a really good curve to it, but the curve you can't adjust.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:32.120
You can lean it so the starting point where your arms start to touch is higher than the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.160
other one if you want and so on.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.400
I actually got this when it first came out.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.880
Maybe something's changed, but when this first came out, I'm like, "Oh, this looks great.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.800
I'm going to give this a try as an alternative to the one that I use."

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.120
And you know what?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.920
Unbelievably, even though it's Bluetooth, it doesn't work on macOS at all.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.040
So if you want to use this and you're using Windows, it looks pretty cool.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.020
If you're not using Windows, it's kind of more like paperweight than it is a keyboard.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.560
Maybe something about this has changed.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.440
But I took it when Microsoft had Microsoft stores, like Apple stores, I took it back

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.680
and I said, "Guys, I bought this.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.980
I can't seem to make it work on my MacBook.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.980
Can you?"

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.980
And they're like, "Oh, yeah, sure.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.980
Of course it does."

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.980
I'm like, "All right.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.980
Here we go.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.980
Let's see."

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.980
No.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.980
No, they couldn't get it to work either.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.980
>> See, I thought I've tried one.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.760
I thought I tried one on a Mac a couple years ago.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.760
>> Possible.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.760
Possible.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.960
I use the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic, which is not the Microsoft Sculpt Surface Ergonomic.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.040
>> Oh, this is the one I tried.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.200
>> Yes, that works everywhere.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.200
That works everywhere.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.200
And it's smaller and it's lighter.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.360
And I think it's actually better across the board, having had both.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360
This one is fine.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.200
The Surface one, no, no, no.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200
This one doesn't work.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200
Okay.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.360
So another one he said, like, some people really like the Apple Magic Keyboard, which

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.520
is more art, less functionality.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.320
It's very standard for Apple hardware.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.320
Save them.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.600
Put the Macs and iPhones stuff aside.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.200
But the accessories, it's like, "Can we just make it beautiful?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.440
I don't care if it's the most uncomfortable thing you've ever touched, like the Magic

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.520
Mouse or anything.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.600
This is like, I want Carpal Tunnel next week.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600
I don't have it now.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.640
How can I get it?

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.800
Let's try this."

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.120
So I don't necessarily recommend that.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.720
And then it starts going through the real ergonomic ones that people might consider,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.720
but it's not.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.400
So let's start with the Advantage 2 keyboard from Kinesis.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.000
And this is one of the weirder, more different ones.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
This is what I got.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.680
This is what I've been using for decades.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.680
Okay.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.680
Describe this for people.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.360
It's just because it's unusual.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:52.240
Well, it seems unusual, but it's a split keyboard where you've got, like, basically divots where

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.160
your fingers go because your fingers are like, you know, they're not flat like a keyboard.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160
They're curved around.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.520
It's like if somebody dug a hole for the keys.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.320
Yeah, it matches the way your fingers move.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.160
And then because when programming, we do things like hit escape and all sorts of other stuff

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.480
and enter and backspace and home and all that stuff all the time.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.520
Those instead of having your pinkies do that work, they put those keys in the middle so

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.400
your thumbs can do it.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.520
And I really love that.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.160
And one of the first things I do is because I'm a VI user or VIM user, is I map one of

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.440
those middle ones to escape because it's programmable too.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.440
So it's nice.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.960
Yeah, that's one of the big, as you started to explore these, one of the big areas is

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.640
like, what does your thumbs do versus, you know, not just spacebar, but your thumbs become

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.640
way more active.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.640
Yeah.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.080
And by programmable, I don't mean that you have to like write a program for it.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.040
I mean, it's just, there's like a key sequence.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.160
You can say, I want to remap this key to this other place and it's pretty easy.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.160
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160
All right.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.400
So that was one that was on the list of considerations.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.720
We'll see how many more of these you've experienced.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.120
So we have the Moonlander Mark 1.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.280
I've wanted to try that.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.160
It looks great.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.680
It's nice and lit up.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.680
It's quite cool.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:17.400
It looks like it almost has like a track, those little nipple things that come on the

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.080
ThinkPads, like where there's like a, it's not a ball, but it's like a stick that's like

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.200
a joystick for the mouse almost.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200
Yeah.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.200
This one looks pretty interesting.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.680
It's a little, you can, I think, program it, but this one's quite cool.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.240
It's fully split and it's got these little bars for the tenting.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.520
So you can adjust like how, you know, side to side, it's like bent, which is pretty neat,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.520
I think.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.640
What do you think about this one?

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.480
I'd like to use that, but one of the interesting bits is the middle keys are, they're just

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.200
blank because you can map whatever you want to them.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:57.040
But, and a bunch of other blank ones, I'd rather have some replacement ones to, because

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.760
I'm really not going to remember how I mapped them.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760
Sharpium.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.760
Sharpium, I guess.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.760
Yeah.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.080
And no kidding.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.080
No kidding.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080
Yeah.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.200
The other thing that I really, that I think about a lot is like, these keys look like

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.680
they have a long up and down like key throw, like the travel of the keys seems high and

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.600
the travel of the keys on the Sculpt ergonomic one is incredibly small, like probably

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.120
less than on a Mac book.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.040
And so like you could just barely move your fingers when you're typing.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.400
And some of these, it's like the mechanical style of like, you know, lots of hand movement,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.560
not fan of it, but that's more than I like.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.560
Mechanical.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.560
Yeah.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.960
But in theory I do.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.200
All right.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.480
Another one is the Kinesis Gaming.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.880
Since you're a fan of Kinesis, have you looked at this thing?

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.560
No, it's flat.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.720
You can, no, you can tilt it.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.720
You can tilt it.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.720
It doesn't have the divots.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720
Oh, I see.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.720
I see.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.720
Gotcha.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.720
I know what you mean.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.720
It has no holes dug for the keys.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.720
Yeah.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.720
This is pretty interesting.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.640
You can like tilt it a lot, but it is kind of just like a, if you want the least weird

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.680
keyboard, but you want to separate it.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.680
Right.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.040
So you can get like the right orientation of your wrists and stuff without causing trouble.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.200
This is a pretty good, we've got the Dygma Rays, which is also.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.680
I've never heard of this one.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.680
Yeah.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.080
It's, it's similar to the gaming one.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.680
I think it's a little bit neater.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.440
It looks like it has like pretty far key throw, but it clicks together and then it clicks

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440
apart.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.760
So that's kind of something you might, people might care about.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.880
Nice magnets to mess up your phone with you that you set next to it.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880
Exactly.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.360
There's the Ergo Docs Easy, which is another one.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.400
Lots of adjustability on like how it's oriented and things, which is kind of cool.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.840
Very thumb friendly, but no, no markings, right.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840
For the programmability.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.440
So you're going to have to need a white Sharpie for this one.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.440
Yeah.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.440
It looks fun.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.920
The ultimate hacking keyboard was Barry Warsaw recommended this one, which it comes with

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.960
a built in track ball looking thing in the middle for one of your thumbs.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.960
Nice.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.960
Yeah.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.960
Okay.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.200
And notice also it has the QWERTY, see as Hoppits says QWERTY, like for a display.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.720
So you can switch it into different modes like Dvorak, like Liz out in the audience

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.720
says I'm a fan of Dvorak.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720
Yeah.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.800
And then we have the advantage 360 keyboard.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.720
That's on my want list.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.240
How's this different than the one that you saw you have already?

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.720
Well, it's, it's split.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.360
So it's, it's, it's like, it's a fully, fully split one.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360
Yeah.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.400
The, the advantage too is actually connected together, but this one's split and it's spread

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.400
apart.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.400
Got it.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400
And it can tent.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.640
Yes, it definitely looks like a content.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.160
And the one that he actually went more, I believe went for is the Dygma Defy.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.240
So you can define your limits with this one, which looks pretty, pretty neat as well.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.280
It's kind of so intimate, you can hardly see a picture of it, but a linkstone for all these

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.280
in the show notes.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.640
But this one, like this one is thumb heavy, Brian, look at how many options your thumb

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.840
gets to play with there.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.320
Oh, I like it.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.320
Yeah.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.320
I like it.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.040
This one takes a little while to get, but anyway, I wanted to go through this because

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.720
I know there's a lot of people out there who might.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.720
Even if he decided on this one, this is the one he decided on now next month, he'll order

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.720
another one.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720
I'm sure.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:34.240
I know, I know exactly, exactly how it feels, but no, I think honestly, it's someone who's

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.480
like had hand issues.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.240
Don't skimp on keyboards.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.680
Don't just think, well, it's weird.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.960
So I'm not going to try it.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.800
But honestly, it's worth not doing something that's just square.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.560
That is your laptop.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.280
Yeah.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.000
Also stand up and walk around to shake yourself out every once in a while.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Exactly.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.160
Or get a chair that just every so often, like the chair just springs you over in the back

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.160
and flings you out.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.720
And so it encourages you to get up before that happens.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.920
It's actually one of the things I like about the Apple watch.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.240
It says like, Hey, you should stand up.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.160
I know it's usually great.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.520
But for when you're like in an airplane, it's like you should get up and walk around.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.520
Like, you know what?

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.520
I'm in the middle seat.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.520
I don't think I'm going to right now.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.520
Thanks Apple watch.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.520
Make me feel even more stuck.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.520
All right.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.120
Well, that's it for my first item.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.120
What you got?

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.120
Okay.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.680
Well, I want to talk about a command line interface tool.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.560
So I just a couple of things.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.520
I just wrote a blog post about testing command line interfaces, particularly arg parse.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.360
I should put a link in that and the extras.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:44.200
But also I was covering that when I was recording the Pytest course, talking about testing command

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.280
line interfaces.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.840
So I tried a few, I went back and tried to click, I tried arg parse and somebody, I'm

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:57.480
sorry, I forget who recommended this is a, there's a new thing called appeal, A P P E

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.560
A L. And it's by Larry Hastings.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.360
And I'm like, Oh, it's probably pretty cool.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.880
And it's got a great logo, like old retro I don't know, like the sixties or something

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880
like that.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880
Anyway.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.760
So one of the things about it is it's just really small.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.460
It doesn't have a whole bunch of boiler plate.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:22.800
So for instance, a hello world, you just import it, create an app and do app command around

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800
it.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.720
And it just picks up that, like, say your hello function has a name to it.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.560
So it the name is going to be an argument that you have to pass in.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.560
So that's neat.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.160
And then I'm like, okay, well, how about more complex things?

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:43.920
Well, things like, Oh, things like optional stuff, like default values, like let's say

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:50.880
we pass in a file name, like F grep, you're going to pass in a file name, but it's optional.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.000
So you just say equals none.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.200
You just do type hints.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:59.320
So you're just saying that this is the command, but, or that F grep is the command, but that

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.000
it takes a pattern and an optional file name.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.360
And it, you tell it it's optional by just saying equals none.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:11.640
So using type hints more, I know that like typer was using type hints, but it still has

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.440
typer still has kind of a lot of boiler plate that you have to do.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.280
And so this is a very minimal, minimal API to get things done.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.020
And I'm pretty excited to try it.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.240
Also look at the contributors.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:34.320
So there's not, there's only five contributors, but it's Larry Hastings, Hugo, Brett Cannon,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.680
Hinnick, and I don't know, Peter, but wow.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.680
Already.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.680
Yeah.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680
Pretty cool.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.680
Yeah.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.680
That's pretty cool.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.680
It looks very interesting.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.440
So nice and simple, nice and simple for command line interfaces.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.440
Worth it.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440
Worth a look.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440
Okay.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440
Do you know what else is worth a look?

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.360
I would like to tell everybody about Scout APM.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.960

Please use this link because it truly supports the show.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.800
Thank you Scout APM for supporting Python Bytes.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800
Indeed.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800
Thank you, Scout.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.800
Very cool product service.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:17.560
I'm going to shine a little light on something that hasn't got a ton of light on it yet,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.560
Brian.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.720
It's a project called Graphinate.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.880
That is the verb of to make a thing a graph, I guess.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.160
It is also a noun, the name of this project.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160
Yeah.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:35.040
So this one comes to us from, one second.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.440
I ran Rivelas and this is a project.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440
It's Graphinate.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:46.560
Graphinate is a Python library that aims to simplify the creation of graphed data structures

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.680
from just pure data sources.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:56.200
So probably the best way to get a sense of this is just look at some examples.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.280
So we go down.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280
It's badge.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.400
It's GitHub readme badge game is strong, by the way.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.400
Yeah.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.400
Wow.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.400
Yeah.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.040
So if we go down a little bit, you can see some examples.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:16.800
Like here is a visualization of a Python AST that looks a little bit like an advanced molecule

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.920
based on benzene, but like a bunch of stuff coming off of it, I guess, like a hexagonal

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.920
thing in the middle.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.960
It's kind of cool.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:31.160
And then here's a relationship of some repositories and dependencies on GitHub.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.280
Very cool.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.040
Here's web page links visualized.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.280
Those are all nice visualizations, right?

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.960
Yeah, that's beautiful.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.200
Looks like dandelion fluff all connected together.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.400
Yeah, you can almost blow on it and like take out a whole segment of the Internet.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400
Yeah.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:56.320
And so the way the way to make this happen, if you go back up here is you write a generator

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.600
that defines the edges.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:03.120
So however you might iterate over your data source, I suppose you could even use like

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.640
recursion and with yield from and all sorts of things to like go through hierarchical

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.960
data models and whatnot.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.680
So you just write a function called here, he calls it edge.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.680
It doesn't have to be called edge.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:19.000
You just give it a decorator called edge and whatever.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.400
And then you just say graph dot materialize, create a model, create this function, boom,

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.440
and then you get those pictures.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.440
That's pretty cool.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.440
Yeah.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.440
Yeah, it is.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.560
It is pretty cool.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:38.640
So anyway, I thought there must be a lot of people that want to have these graph databases.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.320
And Mike Fiedler says graphs, not charts.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.960
Important distinction there.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960
Indeed.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.960
Yeah.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.480
So if you're doing graph type of work, even cyclical graphs seem to be supported, as you

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.520
can see for benzene example, not really benzene example.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.960
So yeah, people can check that out.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.600
I think this is pretty neat.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.600
Benzene.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.600
You're such a nerd.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.600
I know.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.600
I love chemistry.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.600
That's pretty cool.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600
Indeed.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.200
So short and sweet, but there it is.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.200
Yeah.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200
Okay.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.720
Last topic I want to talk about.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.680
Do you know who David Lord is?

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.680
I have heard of him.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.040
Does he do stuff with the web?

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.040
I think he does.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.040
Yeah.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:24.600
So David Lord is the lead maintainer of Flask, Jinja, Click, and a bunch of others.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.200
He works on a project called Palettes.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.000
He's also a PSF fellow.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.400
And as of like just recently, he finally has a blog.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.400
Yay, David.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:42.360
Anyway, so there's a, so thanks David for starting to blog started this month, but he

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.600
wrote this great article.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:52.080
I thought it's just sort of a brain dump is called a disorganized list of maintainer tasks.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.880
And it's not like maintainers really need to know what all they're doing.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.640
But I think people that use open source projects need to know what all maintainers do.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.240
And this list is pretty big.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.400
Why isn't my feature already added for free?

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.760
Yeah, that's, that's what I wanted to highlight is next time when you want to ask, when is

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.520
the next release?

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.800
Instead, look at the project and see where you can start getting involved.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.520
The more help maintainers have, the more they can get done.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.400
And I really love this message.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.680
Currently is looking through this list and saying, huh, if there's a project I want to

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.920
work on, or I'd like to have move faster, what could I help?

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:38.040
Like you could help automate the release process, document a manual, the manual process for

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.040
releases.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.080
You might not know that stuff though.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.960
So maybe improve the test coverage.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.340
I like that one.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:50.100
Maybe help update the docs.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:55.400
So one of the, like, I, a lot of these things I didn't think about, but they definitely

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.460
are time consuming.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.760
One of them, I'm not going to be able to find it right away.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.400
Oh, here it is.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.600
Turning questions and answers into documentation improvements.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.960
So when you get questions on, on Mastodon or an email or something saying, Hey, how

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.760
do I do this?

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.060
That's a great place to put it in the documentation, but that is work.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.720
That's extra things that need done.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.660
So it'd be great to like, even reach out to a maintainer and say, Hey, is there any parts

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.820
of the documentation that you'd like help with or something like that?

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.700
So I kind of love this and I'm kind of overwhelmed.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:34.560
My list is not this big, but wow, David, thanks for all your work.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:40.060
So if you look at flask and GitHub, there's a little bit of attention on that project,

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.060
right?

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.460
Like 65,000 stars, 16,000 forks.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.340
That's a high level of maintainer business, right?

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.340
Yeah.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.340
Yep.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.340
Yeah.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.780
There's a lot going on there and, and click.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.340
I've been kind of using click more also.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.620
So it's, there's a good projects.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.620
That's right.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.620
Yeah.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.620
So very cool.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:08.420
It's almost like a reverse lookup of how can I contribute to open source?

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.060
Yeah.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:17.340
And I actually, this is not, I think we covered like a non-code contributors.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.060
This is all technical work.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.380
It's not, it's not non-technical.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:29.140
It's a technical work to like answer questions and filter PRs and things like that.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.140
All sorts of great things to help out with.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.140
All right.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.860
Well, those are our topics for the day.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.300
Do you have anything extra for us?

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.900
I believe three extras I want to cover real quick.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.140
You got a quick glimpse of them there as I was just showing the stars.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:53.580
First of all, in the weird world of marketing, it is black Friday as of Monday.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.580
As of this, yeah.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.580
Starting this week.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.580
Yeah.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:01.380
I'm not a big fan of it, but you know, people really appreciate it.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.040
I know they wait up for it.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:08.560
So over at talk by on training, we have a different deal this year than we had last

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.240
year and there's two cool aspects of it.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.160
So I just wanted to give a quick shout out and let people know like, Hey, if you were

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.640
looking to take a course now would be in affordable time to do so.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.640
And there's a good cause.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:25.000
So what I'm doing this year is I took five of our most popular courses or most anticipated

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.800
courses that maybe are not even a hundred percent done, but are almost done and put

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.200
them out as early access.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:37.800
So we have that are not Visual Studio Code for the Python developers coming out, which

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.360
is a really awesome course.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.320
I'm just like, how do I change my view?

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.320
It's good to do this and that.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.320
And what am I doing?

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.320
Mind?

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.320
How do I make it do that?

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.080
So this is an early access by Brian Clark and Cicela Phillip, and we'll be out in a

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.800
little bit, but you can sign up for it now.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.440
It's like two thirds of the way done.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.000
So it's still us to get there.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.480
Async MongoDB with Beanie and Pydantic up and running with Git, like a more visual,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.800
more beginner friendly way to get going with Git.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.200
Effective PyCharm because I love PyCharm and our beginner course.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.680
All those are 50% off for the week.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.760
So that's our Black Friday.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.360
Nice.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:21.640
And the other part is we are taking 10% of the revenue and donating it to the hidden

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:29.320
genius projects, which trains and mentors black male youth in technology, creation,

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.400
entrepreneurship, leadership.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.560
Basically a lot of kids who are in places where they might not see a lot of hope or

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.160
don't think tech applies to them.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.680
And they run even up to like 15 month long, not an accelerator.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.960
That's not exactly fast, but like mentorship journeys for them.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.240
And they've had like 10,000 students and we've done a lot of things that like PyCon and whatnot.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.400
So that's the other half.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400
That's pretty cool.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400
Yeah.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.400
Nice.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.400
Thanks.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.400
Okay.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.400
Two more.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:05.680
Python 3.13 alpha is out and boy, oh boy.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.000
How do you want to push your luck?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.800
Friday, October 13th.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:16.320
So Friday the 13th, we're going to release Python 13 alpha.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.600
No, I'm sure it's fine.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600
I'm sure it's fine.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.960
I'm sure people can check out the new alpha.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.960
If you want to start seeing what's coming and the new version, I mean, we just got 3.12,

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.320
but it's now time to move on and start adding features to the alpha.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.640
What do you think?

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.640
I think that's, sorry.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.280
I think that's great.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:43.000
I just, I just reminded, I was reminded of a couple of years ago, one of my kids said

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.720
that they heard that somebody at school say, did you know that this year Halloween's going

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.720
to be on Friday the 13th?

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.920
Maybe a little bit backwards.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.720
Like, no, it's not going to be.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.920
So this is actually a little bit old, but I just realized I was off my list to talk

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.280
about and I skipped it, but the Python 3.13 is already underway.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.400
People want to check it out.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400
Get going on that.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.400
Yeah.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.480
We won't cover the new features that are, they're playing in, but maybe we can cover

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.200
that in an upcoming episode.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.200
Yeah.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.200
We can go to that.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.160
You know, new features will come.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.120
Alpha one is not the end of features.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.120
That's when we get to the beta.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.120
So that's quite a ways off.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.120
More to come.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.120
Yeah.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.120
All right.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:29.200
Last thing from my extras is the PSF and JetBrains have over the last couple of years done their

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.200
survey.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.200
Right.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.040
I think JetBrains is, yeah, again.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:42.080
So the Python developer survey for 2023 is now open for the taking as in take your time.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:48.640
Please go there, fill it out, submit your thoughts, and then in, I don't know what,

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.240
a couple of months, six months, hopefully quicker than that, we'll get results and we

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.240
can go talk about it.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.240
Right.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.240
But the way we can talk about it is that people take it.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.240
Right, Brian?

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.240
Yes.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.360
It's pretty cool that it's out already.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.520
I'm wanting to think about it.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.520
I am as well.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.680
It'd be awesome if it came out while it was still in 2023.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.360
So we don't have to explain.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.920
I know the results say for 2023 and it's 2024, but it actually applies to the most, you know

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.920
what I mean?

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.040
That kind of talk.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:24.440
And Hugo also says alpha 3.13, sorry, 3.13 alpha 2 is due out today.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:30.160
So I just snuck in under the, this is super outdated news, Michael, deadline.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.160
What gives, man?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.160
All right.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.720
That's it for my extras.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.720
Okay.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.800
Well, I just have a couple of extras.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.880
I, this morning I met with the JetBrains and PyCharm team and did a webinar about, do you

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.240
do enough testing, pytest to the rescue?

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.520
And it was really fun.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.960
It was Paul Everett and Helen Scott.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:55.440
And we had a lot of fun this morning and we had like 200 people show up, which was great.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.120
And then it's already had 500 views since three hours ago.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.120
So that's awesome.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.120
It was fun.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.120
So check that out.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.200
People are wondering if they actually do do enough testing.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.960
And so they came to check it out.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.880
Well, it's always fun when you're with Paul and those guys as well.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.880
Yeah.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.960
So the focus of this, I kind of got some technical stuff, especially with the parameterized IDs.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:22.360
Sorry about the nerdiness, but the, but the point was trying to get people to realize

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.120
how easy it is to get started.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.920
I'd like to get people to not be afraid of it.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:33.520
Speaking of pytest, the pytest complete course or the complete pytest course is coming along.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:38.040
I have the, it's going to be 16 chapters.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.680
I've got 11 published already.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.440
The 12th is already recorded and the 13th should be recorded soon.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.880
So I'm definitely on track to getting this done this year.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.360
And it's of course, it's all for sale.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.040
And I was going to ask you this after recording, but do you think it'd be a good idea to do

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.280
a Black Friday sale?

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.880
Yeah, it might be.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.120
I suspect people would be interested in it.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.120
Okay.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.360
I'll, I'll probably set up that.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.640
So if you show up today before I get a chance and it's not there yet, I'll probably by tomorrow,

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.040
I'll do have the Black Friday sale.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.240
Yeah, put the link to the show notes when you get set.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.240
Nice.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.240
All right.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.240
Well, that's all of my extras.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.240
All right.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.280
Brian, do you know it's important to comment your code?

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.280
People tell you this, right?

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.280
Yeah.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.480
As long as the comments are right.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.480
Yeah.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.180
Well, sometimes people, that's part of it.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.120
Sometimes people can just mess up the comments or, you know, they're, they might be inconsistent

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.680
or they could just be boring.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:43.320
It could just not attract, like you might leave the function with a hollow sense of

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.400
this was just, there was no joy here.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400
You know what I mean?

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.400
Okay.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.700
So here's a image that says the proper way to comment your code.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.700
Let me see how I can do.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.700
I did study math.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.280
So the function is called calculate circle area given in the parameters or radius.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.280
Okay.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.660
And it does what you would expect, but the comment is even more than the function.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:11.880
It says in mathematical fields where circles weave with pi's grace, a mystic number we

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:18.260
conceive radiance orbs in their geometric trance circles area, a poet's rhythmic dance

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:29.100
3.14159 are constant true in pi's embrace the circle secrets do where radius meets its

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:36.060
boundless quest area blooms in geometries bequest that it does colon calculate circle

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.060
area.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.060
It's nice, right?

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.060
Yeah.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:48.100
I love also the, the, the it's four lines of code and eight lines of comment.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.780
And that's never going to be wrong.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.780
Right.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:58.220
I mean, that's, I think that's our takeaway is yes.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.580
As long as your comments are just loosely related to the code below it, it's probably

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.940
not going to be wrong ever.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:04.940
So you're good.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.260
You just want to call this function for the joy of the description.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:15.820
and Peter beans points out, indeed, this is where AI might help you write some code.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.380
Oh gosh.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.180
Dear, dear, co-pilot thing.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.900
Write me a poem about this function.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.900
That's awesome.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.600
I think it could totally do it.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:35.380
That's a great use of, of, AI and chat GBT and, and try it now before the entire

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.180
system explodes and implodes on its own.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.180
Exactly.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.260
There's some drama in that world right now.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.260
Yeah.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.420
More of a shift, a fresh, like a weird dramatic shift.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.580
Not anyway, people can check the news.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:56.300
And with that, Brian, I bid you happy poem and haiku writing for your code.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.300
Yeah.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.140
I'm more of a limerick man, but okay.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.140
Make that happen.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.140
All right.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.380
thanks a lot.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.180
And thanks everybody for listening.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:11.100
Thank you for showing up and to the, to the live episode and everybody listening later.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.100
We love you.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.100
Talk to you later.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.100
Bye.
