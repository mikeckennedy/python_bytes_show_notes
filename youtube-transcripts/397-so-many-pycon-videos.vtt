00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.020
Hey, everybody. Welcome to Python Bytes.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.680
Should we get started?

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.920
Let's do it. Hey, Brian. Hey, everyone.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.660
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.920
directly to your earbuds. This is episode 397, recorded

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.660
August 20th. And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.800
And I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.220
This show, this episode is sponsored by us. So check out our stuff, our courses and training

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.220
and everything. Links in the show notes, of course. You can

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.680
connect with us on Mastodon or Fosstodon.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.200
We're at mkennedy @brianokken at Python Bytes. But you can find

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.080
all of those in the show notes as well. Also, you can go to

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.100
pythonbytes.fm/live if you want to join us in the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.300
studio audience.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.080
And finally, we have some exciting news about the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.840
handcrafted artisanal show notes in email form.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.420
Our email friends of the show list has reached a milestone and we've already

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.840
sent out prizes, which is awesome.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.760
Yes. Check your mail. You may be a lucky winner. I know two folks have already

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.500
redeemed some courses over at Talk Python and over on your platform, right?

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.260
Yep. You may already be a wiener. So check your email.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.660
What do you got for us, Michael?

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.700
I've been waiting and waiting to talk about this.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.780
So let's talk about Pi Awaitable.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.680
Was bad, but it had to be done. You know what I mean?

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.760
So Pi Awaitable. This is something I feel like

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.220
probably not a ton of people are going to be using, but

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.360
the concurrency models in Python are only increasing.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.520
The use of async and await is only increasing.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.520
And people writing code,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.100
people writing code in

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.180
C and Rust in other languages to basically

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.800
create lower level faster bits is increasing.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.420
And so I put this out there to help

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.080
those of you who are saying, maybe I want to rewrite the section in C

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.580
or integrate with this other bit of code in C.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.500
So this is a project called Pi Awaitable,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.300
which is really for people writing

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.620
code in C, C extensions for Python.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.960
Okay.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.800
Okay.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.100
And interestingly, it comes from Peter.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.740
Last name is

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.820
Birma.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.500
Peter Birma.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.280
And if you check out his website, it's pretty interesting, actually.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.460
Hey, I'm Peter, software engineer from the United States.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.120
I'm 16 years old.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.480
I've been writing.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.780
I've been coding since I was nine.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.620
And this is just one of my many projects.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.620
So there's a bunch of projects.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.080
You can see that like the pointers.py joke

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.260
that was going around a while ago.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.980
He did that and stuff.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.420
Anyway, so that's kind of interesting and impressive.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.680
And so this is a library that lets you create

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.700
code in C that can accept an async Python function.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.200
So if you write async def in Python, right,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.920
and create some function that uses async and await,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.480
and you pass it off to the C layer,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.260
well, that used to be kind of tricky.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.760
This used to be, this was suggested as a pep,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.760
if you check it out.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.040
I don't know if it got far enough to have a number,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.740
but there's like the whole PEP write-up

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.240
of what is the value of this?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.040
Why does it exist?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.720
How do you use it?

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.560
How should it be added?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.620
And from what I gather,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.440
what I understand is that since this thing only uses the public ABI,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.180
the public interface of the C API,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.000
it doesn't necessarily have to be part of CPython.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.100
It could just be a third-party library.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600
So here it is.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.600
So here it is.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.220
And here's how you, here it goes, Brian.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.720
This will connect with you, I think.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.300
Hash include pyawaitable.h.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.080
Here we go.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.400
Here's a function that takes a Python coroutine function,

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.640
or an async def type of function,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.680
uses this library to create something that can be awaited on it,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.440
and then it returns it.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.140
So then that basically turns the C function into an async,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.700
something that can be awaited from Python.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.560
Okay.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.040
So the C function is the thing that you're waiting for completion of?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.480
Yes.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.620
So here's a C extension written with this library

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.700
that itself is effectively an async def function

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.620
that you just await as if it was a native Python one

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.480
in the event loop and all that kind of stuff.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.420
And it can coordinate with other async things

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.100
like your own ones or the built-in async.io.sleep or whatever.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.700
That's pretty cool.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.660
Pretty cool?

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.060
So I'm pretty short and sweet and pretty focused,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.800
so I'm not going to say much more about it,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.100
but check it out.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.580
It's pretty new,

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.360
but it seems not super advanced in terms of what it does.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.200
So if you're doing a lot of C and async programming,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.340
you can check it out and see what you think of it

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.360
and use it and contribute.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.900
Nice.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.840
All right.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.140
Well, I want to show you something pretty.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.260
So look at this plot.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.280
This is amazing.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.560
So this is just a coal production since 1900.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.700
So why am I showing this?

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.800
Because it looks like it came out of a magazine or something.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.580
You've got these call-outs.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.120
It's a stacked plot, but it's got the colors.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:04.200
Instead of doing a key, they're listed as colored names in one of the descriptions.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.940
This is great.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.500
So anyway, I like this plot.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.380
I want to do something like this.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.440
And luckily, there's an article called Annotated Area Charts with Plotline.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.380
Plotline is an open source Python library.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:27.560
And this is just a tutorial that walks you through doing this wonderful, very professional-looking plot.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.420
And it doesn't even look that complicated.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:38.820
Anyway, so going through this looks pretty fun to try to do some fancy plots like this.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.980
Maybe make me look more professional at my job.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.920
So it uses Plotline, which I hadn't heard of.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.080
And Plotline is based on ggplot2.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.660
And it says Plotline is an implementation of a grammar of graphics.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.020
I did not know that gg and ggplot was grammar of graphics.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.240
That's cool.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.640
I learned that today.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.280
So that's cool.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.220
Anyway, I'm like, well, wait a second.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.780
Is this open source?

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.620
Yeah, it's all on GitHub.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.340
And MIT licensed.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.100
So I feel safe with talking about licenses a lot lately.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.240
And I am paying more attention to the licenses that I use.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.560
Anyway, just a fairly quick shout-out to this wonderful, oh, who wrote it?

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.700
It was Nicola Renni.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.260
And a great-looking blog, too.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.920
But anyway, just had to make really beautiful plots with Plotline.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.540
That's a nice-looking blog.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.400
And very nice-looking presentation.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.800
So Plotline is new to me, so good to know.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.260
Right on to the next one.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.260
We have DeltaBase.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:06.840
So, Brian, I'm sure you've heard of SQLite, the embedded database that you can just point

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.760
at a file and run.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.680
So DeltaBase is kind of like that, but broader, I guess.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.460
It's a lightweight, comprehensive solution for managing Delta tables built on Polars and Delta

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:18.860
Lake.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.480
All right.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.560
So some definitions for this makes sense.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.340
So Polars is a data framework very much like Pandas.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.080
I actually had the guy who created it on Talk Python quite a while ago when it came out.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.220
And the idea is, one, it's super fast.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:44.560
But two, the way that you work with it is a so-called fluent API.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.740
Scrolling for an example, not finding one.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.940
A fluent API that has deferred execution.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.820
So when you work with Panda, you might say, do this filter and then transform this and then

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.180
multiply that thing by something.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.000
It just does every one of those steps and then processes it together.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.700
With Polars, it says, okay, I see what you're doing.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.280
And first you told me to multiply.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.460
And then you told me to filter.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.900
But if I filter and then multiply, I'll be multiplying way fewer things, potentially.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.380
Right.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.340
So that's kind of the big difference.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.800
Anyway, super cool.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.940
Built on Rust.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.160
So obviously, it's got some pizzazz behind it.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.340
Wait.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.600
So are you saying that you can write it in a fluent way that makes sense to you, but it'll

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.560
rearrange it if it makes sense to pull?

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:29.680
Yeah.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.840
It has like a query optimizer type of deal.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.900
It's not quite a query because you're not writing a query, but yeah, it has a deferred

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.800
execution and it takes into consideration.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.340
If I remember this correctly, it takes into account all the different steps because it doesn't

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.900
actually execute until you give it like the command.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.560
And so it's built up all these steps that it can do.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.160
And so it can make decisions about that.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.260
Oh, that's cool.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:52.720
Okay.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.560
Yeah, which is really cool.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.280
But in other ways, it's very similar to Pandas.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.280
Not trying to be a copy of it, but it kind of plays the same space.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.000
All right.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.080
So that's one thing.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.920
The other is Delta Lake.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.760
This is an implementation of Delta Lake, I guess.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.920
And with a space, rather than without a space.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.940
Oh, that clears it up.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:17.240
Totally.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:17.700
Oh, yeah.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.480
So absolutely.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:19.720
Absolutely.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:27.340
So this is a format, actually, that allows you to talk with computational engines such

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:34.960
as Spark, Hive, Snowflake, but also things like DuckDB and others.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.740
And you can just point it at a local file.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.040
You don't even have to have a server.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.360
Okay.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:46.700
So this is a pretty cool looking library that lets you basically, you know, it's optimized

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:55.220
for doing up search and all sorts of things like that efficient versioning and so on.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.920
So you just pointed at some path if you want, sort of the SQLite experience.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.200
And then you say, here's a table.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.560
It has a primary key with its name.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.340
And here is a bunch of data I want you to put into it.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:19.060
And notice that there is no, here's my SQL create statement and my table schema and all

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.180
of those things, right?

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.040
Like, where is that?

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.560
Doesn't exist, does it?

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.340
So you just say, I'm going to commit this thing.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.540
Also, if you go, you can do select statements against it, right?

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.480
Query statement, SQL statements against it.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.900
You go and look at the docs, which I did.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.380
Here we go.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.300
Which are a bit of a work in progress here.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.620
However, if you go and check out the docs, it shows you, for example, under connecting that

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.940
you can connect to just a path, but you could also connect to an S3 bucket.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:12:01.760
You can connect to some kind of Azure data lake container or Google cloud storage, or as

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.780
you saw, a big query.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.960
So this is pretty interesting, right?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.500
Just change your connection string and you get these different data tables.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.680
Neat.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.340
Data lakes, rather.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:11.640
Yeah.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.540
So that's what I have for people.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:19.060
If they're doing this kind of stuff, you know, this is something, kind of a wrapper around

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:19.540
those things.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.500
Also not super popular, but I don't know.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.820
This week, I kind of felt like shining a light on things that were new and could maybe catch

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.380
on with folks.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.260
Yeah.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.960
It looks fun.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.820
Yes.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.880
Also fun videos, I think.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:47.900
So I wanted to highlight a blog post on the PyCon blog at blogspot, which still just cracks

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.280
me up.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:56.600
But anyway, it's PyCon US 2024 recap and recording release, which I was confused by.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.360
I would have thought I recording the release was something you had to sign to make sure that

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.380
your video was releasable.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.500
No, we just wanted to say that the videos from PyCon are out.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.940
And I'll take a look at those in a second.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:17.940
One of the highlights that they noticed was that there were a lot of people showing up.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.700
There was a total attendance of 2,991.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:27.600
That's 2,551 in person and 440 online.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.380
So that's pretty cool.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:35.440
I was just curious, I went and looked, Michael reminded me that if you go to look at PyCon

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:42.140
on Wikipedia, it has a list of years of attendees.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:45.940
2003, there were 200 people in Washington, D.C.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.560
That's awesome.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.460
I think it was like in a hotel or something.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.320
And then I started going in Portland and we were at over 3,000 in Portland.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.420
And then Cleveland was over 3,000 as well.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.720
And then the pandemic hit and it went down quite a ways.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.000
But we're back to better numbers.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.280
2022 was 1,700.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.520
2023 now is over, was 2,100.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.480
And now we're up to 2,500-ish in person.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.740
It's going better.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.300
I think I'm not.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.420
I'd be totally up for going possibly next year, but I'm totally going to hit Long Beach in

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.120
2026.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.980
That sounds great.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.140
I'm definitely going to Long Beach.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:35.680
Yeah.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.480
Bring on some SoCal.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.060
Let's do it.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:38.700
Okay.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:43.040
So they also announced in this announcement that there was a, where is it?

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.860
Somewhere in there.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.440
It has a link to the YouTube thing.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.700
So you can find the link there.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.060
But you can also see it in our show notes.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.800
So if you go to PyConUS at YouTube, all the videos are now up.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.140
And my favorite way to get them is to just hop over to the playlists.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.520
You can go to the, there's a 2024 thing.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.340
But underneath it, you can see the full playlist.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:11.440
And I like that one because I can see all of the names of the videos.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.120
You don't just hit play on the playlist and just binge?

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.920
No.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.480
No way.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.620
But so if you, if you just hit the playlist though, if you start it, you can pause it.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:28.580
But then all the little, all the playlist is over on the side, but you can't see the titles.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.340
Yeah.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:29.620
Yeah.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:29.800
Yeah.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.200
So I agree with you the same way as I do the same way.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.500
Anyway, I've already got queued up and you can search, you can search easier with this,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.060
this way as well.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.120
I'll go away.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.560
And so I already queued up a search for test stuff, of course.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.760
And I've got queued up pipe, pipe test for unit testers by Paul Gansel.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.520
And then this one looks pretty good.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.860
Testing data pipelines with the emotish Swain.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.420
Yeah, it does look cool.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.240
Anyway, lots of stuff to check out.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.800
Awesome.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.400
Awesome.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.720
I think that's all we got for that.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.160
That's all we got.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.920
Those are all of our main items.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:10.720
Yeah.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.420
Got any extras?

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.080
I do.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.620
I have, I have multiple.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.180
I have a couple of things I want to talk about actually.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.500
One, I just impromptu added here.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:35.300
So I've been, one of the things, one of the things I've been working on, Brian, is trying

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:43.940
to do like a little bit less being not distracted by my phone, but just pulled in by my phone

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.780
and other digital things.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.080
Right?

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:53.320
You go, you're like, oh, I got a notification for a text from someone or my music stopped.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.340
Why the heck did it stop?

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.060
Crappy AirPods.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.440
I got to go back and like, find it and make it go again.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.240
Because I paused it for three minutes.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.400
So it must have killed the app.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.340
Like that makes sense.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.260
You know what?

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.380
Super computer in your pocket.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.180
So you go and open it up and you're like, oh, wait, that has a little dot or that has a

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.160
little like badge of three unwrap.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:11.660
What is that?

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.580
And then you start scrolling and then you're over there.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:23.060
And then, you know, it just, there's just this like pressure or this sort of gravity

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.920
of, of that thing being around.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.460
So I am taking an attempt and I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:35.620
I'm making an attempt to make my home screen feel less, more, less like a black hole

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.340
that sucks me in and more like a, I've come here for a purpose.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.740
Let me do the thing and then go on.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:49.120
I would, I looked at maybe getting an Android phone, like a really option to have like a real

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.700
dumb interface, like the nothing phone would be really cool or something like that.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.980
But with my Apple watch and all my other things, basically I have to just throw that thing in

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.440
the trash.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.600
If I switched Android, which is really unfortunate, but I'm like, all right, well, I'm sticking

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.020
with my iPhone.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.120
So I'm, I started using this thing called dumb phone.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.800
Have you heard of this?

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.520
No.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:16.340
So what it does is it uses some weird tricks to take over your home screen on iPhone.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.120
And it just has a really, really simple display.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.480
Like the phone, instead of being an icon, it's just the word phone.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.400
Your messages, instead of being the green thing with the, like the three in red is just the

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.180
word messages.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:30.940
And so on.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:31.860
Okay.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.140
And so for example, here's a, I'll link to it.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.820
A screenshot of my iPhone 13 mini.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.960
It just says web bone messages, maps, weather, and photos on a gray white text on a gray

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.340
background.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.940
And you can swipe it over.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.100
Like the next one I think is videos, podcast news, something like that.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.560
You know, and the ones like productivity, like mail on calendar.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.080
Okay.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.260
If you still want, you still wrote where you're at Mac, you can, you can pull down, you can

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.040
search, or you can even keep swiping until you get past this.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.880
Anyway, this, I'm trying this and people, if they want to try to go down this path so far,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.540
I'm liking it.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.820
I've been messing with my phone.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.960
It's been effective.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.400
I've been like stuck in my phone less.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.200
I'm not a person like, oh, I can't have my phone with me.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.260
I have it with me all the time.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:24.520
But when I go and like check my messages, I don't end up somewhere else as often.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:31.240
Let's say, so I did, I just like took, I've just got a handful of things like those

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.980
sorts of things, on my home screen, but I just have a few on my, on the first screen

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.700
and everything else is on some other page.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.200
yeah, that makes sense so that I can just see my, and then I have a background picture

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.760
of my lovely wife there so I can see.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.800
Oh, yeah.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.280
I didn't have to give it my background.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.580
I guess I could put a background, but it wouldn't look right.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.640
Cause the way this thing works.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.340
So also I took off all of the badges.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:59.280
the, the only thing that I, the only thing that gets a little number that

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.600
I still left was, the phone messages because I actually don't check that very much.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.240
So I'd like to see if there's a message.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.340
not, not actual.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:09.900
Oh yeah.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.960
Actual messages and you know, phone, like somebody left a voicemail.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.780
like who does that anymore anyway?

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.840
but, but at the same time I don't answer my phone.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.720
So, if, if I don't recognize it, so the doctor might leave it messengers anyway.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.400
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.380
But I'll be curious to see how long you can deal with that.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:34.080
you could also just get a cheap phone, but you know, maybe you can, but that's hard to do now.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:42.740
So it's super, well, it's like, okay, well, I also want to have, you know, a nice GPS if I'm somewhere and I want to have car play in my car.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.640
Cause I have like a big display that's like a beautiful screen while I'm driving.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:53.340
And yeah, it's like, and occasionally you're stuck somewhere and you want to read something or whatever.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:53.680
Yeah.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:53.880
Yeah.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.720
I'm not trying to not use it.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.300
I'm just trying to like, when I open and I look at it, I don't want it to be a black hole.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.820
And right now, oddly, it's like a very dark gray, not black, but it's a gray hole.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.180
It's a gray hole that has no interest to me.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.380
Okay.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:07.860
We'll see.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.020
I'll report back.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.760
I'll report back.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.480
Either I give up or I do that.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.540
And then one more thing, we're coming up on the last, last time for the code in a castle.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:25.520
So if you want to come to Italy with me and talk about Python and databases and APIs and all sorts of fun stuff,

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.860
you've got a couple of weeks to sign up.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.260
So code in a castle.com and I hope to see you there.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.680
Nice.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.400
Cool.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:44.220
the extra I've got is I want to say, Hey, I finally got the new course done.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.180
So hello, pie test is available.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.000
It's I gotta figure out how to take this away.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.800
It says 16 lessons, but it's not, it's 12 lessons.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:58.780
some of the, some of the things it's like counting the intro and the source code as lessons.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.600
Those aren't really lessons, but anyway.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:09.280
so, 16 lessons under 90 minutes, I think, slightly under 90 minutes, including the intro and outro.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.560
So there are only a few minutes of video there, but, but, check it out.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:23.280
you can, you can have full, full, the full content table of contents is there at, courses.pythontest.com.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.480
And yeah, loved it.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.200
Loved to hear what people think.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.240
And I'm going to just stick it with 10 bucks for a while.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.160
had a lot of great feedback that said that's about, that's a cool price point.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.300
So we'll leave it.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:36.600
Yeah.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.640
Awesome.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.260
And congratulations.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.220
That's a big deal.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.260
Thanks.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:47.360
And I'm kind of, if we're, we talked about this a little bit, I used a Camtasia to record

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:47.700
this.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:55.780
and I'm gonna, I think I'm going to try to try working with, OBS studio a little

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:55.980
bit.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.780
You definitely should.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:02.680
there's, there's some stuff I love about Camtasia though, that, OBS doesn't

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.540
seem like it does.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:08.400
but let's, let's talk after, let's talk after there's some really neat stuff.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.440
I know you have a little mini stream deck as well.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.340
And that's really awesome for like swapping up the views while you're doing recording and

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:14.860
stuff.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.140
So.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:15.780
Yeah.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:15.840
Yeah.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.240
Cool.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.340
Yeah.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.080
Cool.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.380
Well, do you have anything funny for us?

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.480
I will let you be the judge.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.600
I have philosophy for us.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.380
Okay.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:29.800
So previously we've talked about the tower programming and I want to come back to the tower programming.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:39.280
And this is like a parody, ancient philosophy, sort of Eastern philosophy sort of thing here.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.740
So this one is a 4.3 from the tower.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.080
Okay.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:44.820
Okay.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.700
Master was explaining the nature of Tau to one of his novices.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.620
The Tau is embodied in all software, regardless of how insignificant, said the master.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.060
Is the Tau in a handheld calculator?

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.900
Asked the novice.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.320
It is, came the reply.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.300
Is the Tau in a video game?

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.320
Continued the novice.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.000
It is even in a video game, said the master.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.260
And is the Tau in the DOS or a personal computer?

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.960
The master coughed and shifted positions lightly.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.560
The lesson is over for today, he said.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.840
Yeah.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.580
Pretty good.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.280
Yeah.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:20.840
Yeah.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.520
That's good.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:29.280
And you can be okay with, like joking about DOS because it doesn't even exist anymore.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:29.800
Exactly.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.760
Exactly.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.400
It's not going to hurt anybody.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.820
Except for those three people who are still on their 386 and won't give it up.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.720
Word perfect is perfect for me.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.400
I love it.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.420
Come on.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.700
I remember getting my 386.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.940
I'm like, gosh, I don't think I can, I don't think I'll need another computer for a really long time.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.300
I know.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.620
I got a 486.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.120
DX33, not the SX25 megahertz.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.600
The DX33.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.660
And it had a turbo button and it was amazing.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.880
A turbo button.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.400
Like, why would you turn it off?

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:06.360
Because if you wanted to play the games written for the 286, they went really fast and you couldn't play them at all.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:06.840
It was out of control.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:12.360
So if you hit, if you disable turbo, it was more of a slow it down button, but they didn't want to call it that.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:18.420
So you could play the ones that just use the frame rate instead of real time per frame.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.000
Like MechWarrior and stuff, I think was out of control.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.100
It was like those old record players that you had, that speed controls on them.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.020
Yes, exactly.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.700
For the small ones or the big ones.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:27.880
Yeah.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.720
45s and whatever.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.280
Funny.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.220
Nice.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:33.940
Okay.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:39.680
Well, thanks again for our wonderful Python bytes and, we'll see everybody next week.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.520
Yeah.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.340
See you later.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:41.820
Thanks everyone.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:41.820
Bye.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:41.820
Bye.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:41.920
Bye.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.660
Thank you.
