00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.560
Hey, Brian. Hey, everyone.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.160
Hey.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.800
Excellent to be here. Good to be back from the holiday break.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.000
And let's just kick it off.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.180
Yeah, let's do it.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.800
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.060
where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.740
This is episode 416, recorded January 13, 2025.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.380
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.600
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.060
And this episode is brought to you by us.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.400
Check out our stuff that we're doing over at Brian's course.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.160
Where's your course, Brian? I forgot the URL.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.560
Pythontest.com.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.580
Pythontest.com. That's right.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.700
And over at Talk Python Training.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.520
Links are in the podcast player show notes or on the homepage,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.560
all of those things.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.900
Follow us on Mastodon and Blue Sky.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.480
We love to connect with people over there.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.840
In fact, Brian, you don't really have visibility into this yet,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.880
but there's a bunch of recommendations I got from,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.300
I think it was Blue Sky, which fills out many of my topics today.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.300
Nice.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.040
Yes.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.000
And I encourage people to follow us out there.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.360
Use the starter pack on my profile if they wish.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.200
And if you want to get all this stuff sent to you automatically as an email,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.660
and this might be getting an upgrade.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.880
We're not entirely sure yet.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.540
We're playing around with some ideas here.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.360
Yeah.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.500
Content-wise.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.060
But you should definitely subscribe to the email.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.400
PythonBuyes.fm.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.180
Click on newsletter.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.280
Guess what?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.280
You'll get a newsletter if you do it.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.700
That'd be awesome.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.180
We'd love to talk to you there.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.460
And with that, Happy New Year, Brian.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.240
It's been a couple of weeks we've been on break.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.640
Some of it by decision.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.260
Some of it mandatory by family stuff.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.820
All those kinds of things.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.520
That's on my end.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.940
But welcome back.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.780
Happy New Year.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.360
Welcome back.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.720
Yes.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.120
Thanks.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.800
It's really good to be back.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.720
I'm glad to start talking coding and Python on the air again.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.940
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.920
You get to this age where you get phone calls out of the blue.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.020
You've got to come help your father with this because he's old and can't do stuff.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.260
And just sometimes you jump on a plane for non-vacation reasons,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.700
and it's not as fun as it could be.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.460
But you've got to do it.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.020
That was me last week.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.620
Okay, well, how about this week?

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.240
What do you got for us?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.440
Well, I was thinking that this week, at the start of the new year,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.580
people might be thinking of some changes.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.620
So some of the changes they might be thinking about is terminal or shell changes.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.260
If you're kind of a terminal person, and especially if you're a macOS or Linux user,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.640
one of the things that just came out recently is Ghosty.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.560
So at G-H-O-S-T-T-Y.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.140
Get it?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.160
Yeah, that's clever.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.860
That's clever.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.700
It's a fast feature-rich and cross-platform terminal emulator

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.040
that uses platform native UI and GPU acceleration.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.960
So super fast, super featured.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.660
Why am I covering this?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.420
It's kind of fun, actually.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.340
So Ghosty, have you heard about this?

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.340
I have absolutely heard about it.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.180
I have it installed.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.280
I have played with it.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.260
It is fun.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.720
It is not yet dethroned warp as my way to go to yet.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.280
But I like it.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.240
Both of them are written in high-speed languages.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.300
I think Ghosty is zig of all.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.480
Zig language is awesome.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.960
Yeah.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.540
And warp is rust.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.540
But yeah, I love it.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.440
Yep.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.780
So Ghosty just came out.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.400
Let's see.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.620
They did the announcement of a release in October.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.000
But it just came out at the end of the year.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.420
I think it was the 31st of December or something like that.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.800
end of the year.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.800
But it's...

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.720
So why am I talking about this?

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.400
Because it's kind of fun.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.440
And also, it has some interesting heritage.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.660
So this is started by Mitchell Hashimoto,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.020
which is one of the co-founders of HashiCorp.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.720
I think he left HashiCorp in 2023.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.160
But anyway, some nice heritage.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.440
It's feature-rich.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.580
What does feature-rich mean?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.000
It's feature-rich, fast.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.760
It's got themes.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.240
It's got all that sort of stuff.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.900
But a couple of reviews that I was reading of it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.960
were saying that it really is pretty fast

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.480
and partly because it's less code.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.540
They really...

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.440
The code for it is a lot more streamlined

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.020
than a lot of other things.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.980
And having it be native

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.940
and really focusing on some of the speed

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.500
as well as features.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.840
So the tagline really,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.340
when you go to the About page,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.780
it says,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.420
there are many excellent terminal emulators available.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.340
But they all kind of force you

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.120
to either choose speed, features,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.560
or a native UI.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.520
And Ghosty wants to do all three.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.840
And I kind of like that.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.760
I've had issues with things

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.620
that don't really look like...

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.740
You know, they don't really look like a native feel.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.940
Anyway, I've just downloaded it,

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.200
started playing with it a little bit,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.600
haven't done much with it.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.500
But a lot of people on Blue Sky were talking about it

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.300
in Mastodon over the break.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.480
As far as shells go,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.440
so Ghosty does integrate with shells,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.020
with different shells.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.420
It integrates with...

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.860
It says,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.280
some of the features require integrating with your shell.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.180
It automatically does automatic injection

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.440
of shell integration for Bash,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.080
ZShell,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.780
Fish,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.660
and Elvish.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.720
And I've been thinking about Fish

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.760
because Fish was actually in the news as well.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.480
Fish...

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.620
I see.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.700
You're into jam bands?

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.140
I got it.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.340
Yeah.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.060
I kind of forgot about Fish.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.520
Anyway.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.840
But an announcement in December as well

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.220
is that Fish shell is...

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.420
The 4.0 is in beta

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.340
and it is rewritten in Rust.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.660
So that's kind of fun.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.460
Do you know what it was written in before?

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.460
I think it was C or C++.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.540
Yeah.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.140
A port from C++ to Rust.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.000
So not sure about the reasons around that,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.400
but it's kind of fun.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.820
It'd be fun to get...

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.360
If you want to contribute or whatever.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.780
I think there's more energy around Rust

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.140
than C++ right now.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.540
Yeah.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.960
There is.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.300
One of the things that I'm intrigued by with Fish

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.240
because I've been setting up new environments lately

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.800
and stuff

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.820
and I like my environment,

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.840
my shell environment,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.200
but keeping it all,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.060
like all the extras on different machines

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.500
is a little tricky.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.020
and apparently Fish has a lot of stuff built in

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.280
that other people have to configure later.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.680
Okay.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.660
I'll give you a shot also.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.920
Yeah.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.960
I'll check that out.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.420
Very nice.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.960
You used to do Z shell and OhMyZshell.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.500
Are you still...

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.620
Yeah.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.960
Yeah.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.180
Okay.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.880
If I use the regular terminal

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.180
or iTerm or something like that,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.680
then I am.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.240
But I think with warp,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.220
I'm pretty sure...

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:14.520
Yeah,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.740
I'm sure that it doesn't run Z shell.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.240
Not directly anyway.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.380
It may underneath the cover somehow,

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:20.940
but...

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.440
Okay.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.840
It feels like it kind of does its own thing,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.500
you know?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.280
Yeah.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.260
And I'm enjoying it.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.160
It comes pre-built with a lot of stuff

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.020
that I used to install,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.260
like McFly and other types of stuff.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.660
Well,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.720
so I used to have...

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.080
It used to be a heavy-duty Z shell user

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.220
and had tons of configuration changes,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.740
but when I started doing a bunch of machines,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.980
I kind of just went back to vanilla Bash

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.460
and with just like a Bash RC file.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.660
But we'll see.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.220
It's the history.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.300
The history is so hard on Bash

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.700
compared to some of the other things,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.980
unless you configure it right.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.740
Yeah.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.540
Yeah.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.380
Anyway,

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.900
what you got for us?

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.820
All right.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.780
Let's take it for a loop here.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.760
This one comes to us from Owen Lamont,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.160
and I told you stuff was coming from Blue Sky,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
and Owen has a special honor in this episode.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.540
He doesn't know it,

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:25.340
but he might have a perfect trifecta

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.000
sort of thing going on here.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.300
So this one that we're going to cover,

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.540
he pointed out,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.880
and then the next one we're going to cover

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.440
is...

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.420
The next one I'm going to cover

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.080
is my second main topic,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.940
is actually created by him.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.500
Then something else,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.860
I can't remember exactly what it was,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.480
was referred to.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.840
So he's got three things

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.840
in three different sections,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.360
which is pretty wild.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.260
So Owen,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.280
thanks for sending this in.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.760
And like I said,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.020
I encourage lots of people

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.400
to send their stuff in

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.800
because that is super helpful,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.000
and we'd love to have it up.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.180
So this one is called Winloop.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:08:59.660
Now,

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.660
something that's a hassle

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.160
is if you're working in AsyncIO,

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.440
well,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.060
AsyncIO is not

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.760
as high performance

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.460
as it could be,

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:11.780
right?

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.540
So there are things like

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.440
UVlib,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.000
which is the backend

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.040
powering things

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.420
like UVloop,

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.420
hence Winloop,

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.040
UVloop.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.540
The problem is

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.120
UVloop is not

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.880
compatible

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.840
with Windows,

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.600
even though the foundation

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.720
of LibUV

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.960
is compatible.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.920
Make that make sense,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.120
huh?

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.700
So this person

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.360
came along

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.600
and worked on it,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.100
Visonex,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.020
and said,

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.320
all right,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.580
I've been waiting for people

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.140
to set this up

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:42.800
and make it work,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:42.980
and,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.060
well,

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.320
I guess I'm going to have

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:45.960
to do it myself.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.660
So he said,

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.580
because nobody was willing

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.120
to step up

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.080
after so many years

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.460
of waiting,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:49.940
I went ahead

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.520
and downloaded

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.020
the source code

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.720
for UVloop,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.120
started modifying

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.820
the source code

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.360
to be Windows compatible

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.520
by carefully removing

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.480
and changing parts

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.080
that were not made

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.600
for Windows,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.680
such as forking processes

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.900
rather than launching

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.800
subprocesses,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.500
and so on,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.120
and so on.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.360
So here's a,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.360
does it have any benchmarks?

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.380
Where are your benchmarks?

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.500
I think it might actually,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:11.720
no.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.560
Yeah,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.520
it does have some benchmarks.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.100
So this is a way

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.500
to replace the asyncIO event loop

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.120
to upgrade it

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.580
to have faster performance,

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.440
much like UVloop does

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.680
for Mac and Linux,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.480
but you can just do that here,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.560
and you can kind of use them both,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.200
right?

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.900
You can just do

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.900
sort of an import,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.420
try,

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:34.700
accept,

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.220
like try to import this

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.560
or check your platform

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.780
and import the right thing

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.620
and just sort of swap

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.180
between them.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.100
Okay,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.400
cool.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.120
Yeah.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.700
So it says

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.480
if you run it

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.360
with the different policies,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.020
it'll show you

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.060
like how much faster

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.040
you can get,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.460
like it gets,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:51.740
I don't know,

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.760
is this like five times faster

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.080
or something

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.660
for some benchmark,

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.080
you know,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.960
all those things go.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.980
And then,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.600
where are we?

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.140
They've got some nice examples.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.420
Yeah,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.400
it says check out the

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.060
how to use

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.100
when loop,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.900
when uv loop

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.600
is not available.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.880
So it just basically says

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.580
if the platform

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.360
is win32,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:12.880
sigwin,

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.620
or CLI,

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.900
just import the run method

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.580
from win loop,

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.500
otherwise import it

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.640
from uv lib.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.700
You could also probably,

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.680
you know,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.360
probably a nice way

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.140
would just to be set

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.980
the asyncio event loop policy

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.420
before an event loop

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.480
comes into existence,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.740
which then when it goes

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.600
and creates a no event loop

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.160
automatically,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
it'll use the win loop

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:34.900
or uv loop one

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.240
or whatever.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.240
But,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.540
you know,

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.260
people can check it out.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.080
It shows how to use it

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.000
with FastAPI

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.740
and things like that.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.980
So pretty neat,

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.320
I think.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.740
Yeah,

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.540
that's cool.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.380
Yeah.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.440
So if you're doing

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.000
asyncio stuff

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.620
and you're on Windows

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.300
and you've been like,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.540
people keep telling me

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.380
UV loop is awesome.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.080
I hear you.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.060
I can't use it.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.800
Win loop,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.280
check it out.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.820
And thanks Owen

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.440
for sending that in.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.160
I also kind of,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.040
I really like that

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.280
it kind of works with both

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.080
or you can,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.420
you can have,

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.240
have some examples

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:07.820
to use both

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.760
because there are people

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.040
that are test,

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.420
you know,

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:11.680
test,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.440
developing on Windows

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.280
and pushing to Linux.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.340
Yeah,

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.500
or you're a framework creator

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.520
and you have users on both.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.580
Yeah,

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.660
which you should think about

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.180
because like we've said before,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.220
it's like over half

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.060
of the Python users

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:26.880
are using Windows.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.440
Yeah,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.020
the majority.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.560
If you single down

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.400
to a single platform,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.200
the majority,

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.320
the biggest one is Windows

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.760
and then it breaks

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.240
into pieces,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:36.580
right?

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.140
Yeah.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:38.700
Luckily,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.600
all the other pieces

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.220
are Linux-y sort of things.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.520
That's right.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.700
And I think that's the problem.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.180
Everything is POSIX-like

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.840
except for Windows.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.300
Yeah.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:48.960
That's a challenge.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.740
Yeah.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.740
Oh, well.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.360
Anyway.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.820
Okay.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.640
Well,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.920
let's take a look

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.080
if I get this right.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.420
Oh,

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.440
I've got some news

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.940
from both,

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.760
from Astral,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.320
a couple of Astral topics,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.040
UV and Ruff.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.540
first off,

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.700
I saw this

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.540
like little notice

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.560
that there's a rough 2025

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.000
style guide

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.200
and I'm like,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:11.720
what?

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.380
What do we need

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.280
a new style guide

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.940
for 2025?

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.800
But I'm really,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.740
there's a bunch of stuff

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.080
in here,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.120
but what I'm really excited

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.560
about is the modifications

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.900
to the F-string formatting.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.500
And yeah,

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.100
we're getting really nerdy here

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.140
if you're getting excited

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.120
about F-string formatting.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.040
But F-yes.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.920
There was a great sticker

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.860
for all that said F-yes

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.780
when f-strings came out.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.640
So one of the cool things

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.320
is I guess it didn't do

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.700
deal with the formatting,

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.060
the expressions inside,

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.280
the interpolated expressions

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.860
inside of the curly braces

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.780
inside of an F-string.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.080
And so,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.740
yeah,

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.240
often it's just a variable name

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.160
which isn't a big deal.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.300
but you can put code in there

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.980
and now Ruff will format

00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.760
that correctly.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.440
So it's doing like,

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.000
it shows an example

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.700
of like,

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.800
you know,

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.940
layer method plus five

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.020
and it was two stuck together.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.980
So now Ruff will spread it

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:12.620
out a little bit.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.840
I do that all the time.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.160
Like if I have a time delta

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:15.760
and I want to know

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.520
how much time,

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.460
I want to represent

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.300
that in milliseconds,

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.360
but it has a dot total seconds.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.340
So I'll just times a thousand.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:22.480
Yeah.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.240
And actually more and more now

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:24.720
I'm like,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.880
do I really need to assign this

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.320
to a variable

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.260
just so I can stick it

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:28.940
into an F-string?

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.960
I'll just stick the code

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.540
in the F-string.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.280
So I'm doing that more and more.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.680
So having Ruff deal with that

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.060
is great.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.480
But with that also,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.960
there's a bunch of other cool things

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.600
like quotes are now normalized

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.440
in f-strings

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.060
according to a project configuration.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:43.740
so if you want,

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.040
if you set it to be double quotes

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.720
or single quotes,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.180
it'll deal with that.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:48.900
But,

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.180
and they're left untouched

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.020
if normalizing would result

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.020
in an invalid F-string.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:54.460
Of course,

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.360
it checks to make sure

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.940
it doesn't mug things up.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.460
Looks for

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.980
unnecessary escape

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.900
like back ticker,

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.160
the,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:04.620
you know,

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.340
the backslash

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.800
if it doesn't,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.220
if it's not needed to be there.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.120
So that's nice.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.800
Yeah,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.360
that's excellent.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.040
Like for example,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.980
you have single quote

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.760
and then you will have

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.600
another single quote

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.200
in the string.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.140
You've got to escape it.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:15.800
It'll,

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.860
rather than leave it there,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.480
it'll convert it

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.280
the outer strength

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:19.860
to double quotes.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.780
So you just don't need

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.740
the escape at all,

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.540
which is perfect.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.260
Yeah.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:23.960
Yeah.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.740
And then one of the last things

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.420
is it looks

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.100
at the interpolated expressions

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.780
in an F-string

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.340
to see whether

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.380
it might be acceptable

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.700
to split the F-string

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.780
over multiple lines.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.520
So,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.460
and,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:37.460
and,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.040
and it has done that

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.660
with strings

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.360
of splitting it

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.300
on multiple lines.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.780
But I don't think

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.600
it did that with f-strings

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.580
before because it could

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.080
have mucked up

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.820
the interpolation.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.840
Now it's figuring that out

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.960
and doing the right thing.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.640
So,

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.960
just lots,

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.360
lots of good cleanup work

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.040
for f-strings.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.640
There's other stuff

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.140
in here too

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.540
that I think is really nice.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.260
There's a

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.000
prefer wrapping

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.840
the assert message.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.420
Basically,

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.880
do I care about this?

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.440
Not really,

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:02.980
except for

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.160
I like the new one better.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.740
It looks better.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.520
So,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:05.900
sure.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.640
better looking code

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.520
is always a good thing.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:08.920
So,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.600
thanks Astral for not

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.360
like ignoring.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:11.660
I mean,

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.780
rough is why we've got,

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.760
fell in love with these guys

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.480
in the first place.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:14.880
And,

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.600
so,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.200
so I'm glad that there's

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.160
still work going on here.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.920
Now,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.160
I've got a bit of a tangent

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.400
that seems like a tangent,

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.040
but not really.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.780
The Python 3.14,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.640
3.14,

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.280
the Py release of Python

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.300
is in alpha right now.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:31.780
December,

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.180
as of December 17th,

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.140
there's the alpha 3.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.060
so it's been an alpha

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:35.620
for a while.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.100
But,

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.480
so you can play with it,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.500
but how do you play with it

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.640
if you're kind of a uv person?

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.440
Well,

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.160
Charlie Marsh posted

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.900
in,

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.700
just on the 7th,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.840
that you can use,

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.080
what,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:52.900
what is it?

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.080
UV Python install.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.300
UV Python install,

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:54.760
yeah.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.780
3.14,

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.680
and then you do

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.700
--preview

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.480
because 3.14 isn't there yet,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.420
but if you use the preview,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.060
it works.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.060
And after,

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.340
after I did this,

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.840
now I can just,

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.220
now I don't have to use preview

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:08.960
when I just say,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.820
like uv,

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.200
V,

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.700
and V,

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.380
and then pick.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:12.920
Yeah,

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.540
yeah,

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.220
just Python,

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.900
yeah,

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.220
3.14 or whatever,

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:16.460
yeah.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.120
It just works

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.340
because now it's on my machine.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:18.580
So,

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.920
so there's a preview mode

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.900
to grab that,

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.960
which is really nice.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.960
I like it.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.060
that's excellent.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.060
Yeah,

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.080
they're doing really good work

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:28.480
over there

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.120
and you're right

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.340
that,

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.680
that rough started it all.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.900
So that's,

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.980
that's really cool to see.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.380
And one of the things

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.080
that I've noticed

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:36.700
that I'm,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.360
I,

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.680
I wasn't really up

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.820
for a lot of the,

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.140
like the big packagers

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.740
to create my Pi project

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.600
toml for me

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.220
and to start a project,

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.540
but uv init,

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.120
it rocks.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.840
Okay.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.240
It does just enough.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.100
Like if you pop into a new,

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.420
a new project

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.120
and just say,

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.140
UV and like you,

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:55.940
you start coding

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.000
and you say uv init,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.140
it creates enough boilerplate

00:17:59.140 --> 00:17:59.860
that's good,

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.900
but not too much.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.760
Like it'll generate

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.520
a Pi project toml for you,

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.420
but it's not too big.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:05.980
You can just,

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:06.480
you know,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.700
add more stuff to it.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.000
That is such a balancing act,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.220
right?

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.620
Like I'm going to create

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.080
a new project,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.900
run this cookie cutter

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.640
or this other template.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.780
Do you want to use Postgres?

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.780
How about celery?

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.920
Do you like caching?

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.820
What kind of,

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:19.260
like,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:19.740
whoa,

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.020
whoa,

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:20.860
I just,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.520
I just don't,

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.240
I just need to like

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.080
a Pi project toml

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:23.700
and a few things

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.860
and what's the right layout

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.040
relative structure.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.140
Let's,

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.700
let's not overdo it,

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.020
you know?

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.420
Yeah,

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:29.780
let's not overdo it.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.340
Too much opinion.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.000
And then also uv sync.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.300
I'm using a uv sync all the time.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.540
So you could clone a project

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.440
and do uv sync

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.180
and it'll pick up the project toml

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.460
and create a virtual environment

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.800
and all that.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.100
So,

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:42.800
love that.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.720
Well,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.640
I really appreciate

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.480
your perfect segue

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.280
because this next topic of mine

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.420
is called uv dash secure.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.320
Nice.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.600
Pretty awesome.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.740
This was the one created

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.640
by Owen Lamont

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.200
and he just released,

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.000
he's been working on it

00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.500
for a little while

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.640
and people might be familiar

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.680
with pip audit.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.120
So pip audit

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.240
will go

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.300
and look at

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.140
what is installed

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.320
in your virtual environment.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:08.800
So,

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.380
I've got a virtual environment,

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.720
I've installed some packages

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.520
through whatever,

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.760
pip install dash E

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.220
or

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.360
through just pip install

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.260
or dash

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.120
requirements,

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:18.840
however you get it,

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.020
right?

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.620
you've got all those

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.280
requirements installed

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.480
and what if there is

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.620
some kind of malware

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.960
or some other horrible thing

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.360
that you mistyped

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:28.840
like

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.080
jang

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.060
jangagu

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:31.940
or I don't know,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.160
whatever,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.500
like you,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.760
somehow you miss a letter

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.000
and you get something terrible

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.960
or something was just taken over,

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.460
it was fine

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.340
and then it wasn't fine.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.300
This will go,

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.340
pip audit will go back

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:41.980
and talk to,

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.540
I can't remember exactly

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.480
what it's going back to

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.340
but there's an API

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.560
that checks for vulnerabilities

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.440
in

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.020
different packages

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.620
and basically

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.900
if a vulnerability is found,

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.660
it's listed there

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.280
and you'll know,

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:52.520
right?

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.280
Cool.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.080
Cool,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.680
so that's great

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.080
but that requires you

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.200
to have all those things

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.760
installed

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.760
and

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.260
it

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.740
doesn't work,

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:01.960
it doesn't

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.240
like look at things

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.620
like the uv lock file

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.580
so uv secure

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.860
allows you to ask

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.880
hey,

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.940
what is the status

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.600
and vulnerability story

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.940
of my project

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.620
before I install them?

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.100
Right?

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.300
It's

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.740
it's good to know,

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:15.960
hey,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.020
you've installed a virus

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:17.960
that is now running

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.780
and losing your computer

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.660
you'll want to try

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.320
to work on that

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:20.840
get it out

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.080
it's better to know

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.880
before you install it

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.200
right?

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.420
And so

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.460
when Owen

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.180
submitted this to us

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:29.420
I'm like,

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.040
this is awesome

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.400
but I'm not a

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.160
UV sync

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.860
kind of guy

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.640
I'm a

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.220
UV pip install

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.900
and a uv pip compile

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.060
to generate a requirements

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.000
dot txt file

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.940
so

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.660
he said,

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.160
no problem

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.520
I'll update it

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.540
to also do

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.460
requirements files

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.800
and then

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.840
I ran

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.680
just

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.780
go in

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.800
to the

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.020
working folder

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.240
for Python bytes

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.280
and say

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.140
UV dash secure

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:55.860
so first of all

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.400
you

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.920
can install it

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.760
with uv as a tool

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.480
or with pipx

00:20:59.480 --> 00:20:59.940
or however you want

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.420
then you say

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.760
UV dash secure

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.140
and it'll say

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.980
I'm looking at this

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:04.780
requirements file

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.580
or I'm looking at

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.480
this lock file

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.220
or whatever it is

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.620
and it'll take a minute

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.620
because it's

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:09.920
you know

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.320
the Python bytes

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.680
project has 86

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.660
packages it uses

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.940
so it calls that

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.100
API 86 times

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:16.760
and gets a response

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.480
there's a bit of a delay

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:17.720
there

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.480
I'm sure you could

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.780
parallelize that

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.180
but maybe harm the API

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:21.940
I don't know how much

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.740
it can take in parallel

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.600
but anyway

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.280
it says

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.420
if there's a problem

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.220
or whether everything

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:27.740
looks safe

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.180
and hey

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.040
everything looks good

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.660
gotta love that

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.080
nice

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.380
yeah so

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.560
nice work on that

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:34.780
Owen

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.400
and

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.600
yeah people can

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.400
check out

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.320
UV secure

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.120
cool

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:42.900
yep

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.360
and

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:44.660
yeah

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.860
there it is

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.940
I'm being checked

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.720
to see if I'm secure

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.440
trying to pull it up

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:49.700
but yeah

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:50.960
scan your uv lock file

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.540
for dependencies

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.640
with known vulnerabilities

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.680
and now also

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.600
works with

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.440
requirements.txt files

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.380
that were generated

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.220
by UV

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.600
I imagine with others

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.040
as well

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.060
pinned ones at least

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:02.880
you know

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.820
yeah

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.700
I mean

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.580
people might write

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.000
their own

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.840
who knows

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.480
whatever

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.300
yeah

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.880
they might

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.440
they might

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.820
all right

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.080
that's it for our main items

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.700
isn't it

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.460
it is

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.120
yeah

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.600
you got any extras

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.580
just I guess

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.080
a little bit

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.500
over the

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.340
break

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:23.920
I did

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.240
I did

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.180
play around

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:26.760
with pytest

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.140
more

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:28.720
and

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.520
started

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.440
testing code again

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:31.800
so

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.160
we talked about

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:34.720
doing seasons

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.380
so I thought

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:35.720
yeah

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.160
what the heck

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:36.460
I'll do

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.180
I'll shift over

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.000
and so

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.480
after nine and a half years

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.440
and 223 episodes

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.260
season two is starting

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.720
so

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.400
I'm going to do

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.100
pytest plugins

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:49.720
so please

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.780
anybody

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.360
so there's an episode up

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.080
just introducing

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.440
the

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.960
introducing the season

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.980
they'll be probably

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.380
short

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.380
short or long

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.180
depending on what

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:58.920
we want to talk about

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.340
for different plugins

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.060
some of them are going to

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:02.600
combine

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.540
plugins

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.740
like all the orderings

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:05.560
together or something

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.540
or whatever

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.400
or individual ones

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.060
so

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:09.940
if you'd like to

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.540
submit your favorite

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:11.880
plugin

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.220
or something you'd like me

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.020
to take a look at

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.800
go ahead

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.420
and how would you do that

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.620
you would

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.620
either go to

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.280
Blue Sky

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.220
or Mastodon

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.360
or

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.660
I recently added

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.560
a contact form

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.740
on pythontest.com

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.200
oh

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.180
I have to add

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:27.760
my Blue Sky

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.800
to that contact form

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.040
also

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.500
oh

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.860
come on now

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.180
don't forget it

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.840
anyway

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.740
so

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.600
that's my extra

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.360
excellent

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.540
and real-time

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.140
follow-up

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.820
you have

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.160
Henny

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.800
out there

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.180
points out

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:42.740
that sneak

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.240
maybe

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.240
is possible

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:44.840
does something

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.080
similar

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.340
yeah

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:45.960
that's for sure

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.360
I wonder

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:46.760
it's using

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.160
the sneak

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:47.540
API

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.040
for that

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:48.600
UV secure

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.160
not sure

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:49.400
anyway

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:49.660
but

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.160
but yeah

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:51.780
that's another

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.620
thing to consider

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.420
okay

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.980
I have a few

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.440
extras

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.560
this is the

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.000
trifecta part

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.880
and I'm just

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.420
going to link to it

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:00.800
I'm not going to

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.220
play it

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.060
we've already

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:02.620
all had

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.120
plenty of

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:03.600
heavy metal

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.700
but

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.860
Owen

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.400
was inspired

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.560
by the funny

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.860
song that we did

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:11.300
with remember

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:11.820
the curl

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.440
heavy metal

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.060
like super

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.540
heavy metal

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.300
that was awesome

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.100
TLS

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.660
connect

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.140
hello

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.120
so

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.200
he did one

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.140
for HTTP status

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:20.440
codes

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:20.880
and it goes

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.320
through all

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:21.700
the different

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.440
HTTP status

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:22.700
codes

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.000
so

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:23.520
I'll link

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:23.800
to that

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.020
you can

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.420
play it

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:24.780
make sure

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.060
you turn

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:25.720
on the audio

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.120
because it's

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.760
off by default

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.140
because

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:27.660
it's pretty

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.100
good

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.260
it's pretty

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:30.520
good

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.940
I do enjoy

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.500
it

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.300
I wonder

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:33.660
if it has

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.400
I'm a teapot

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:34.640
in there

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.100
I didn't

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.540
listen that

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:35.740
hard

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.100
before

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:36.880
1819

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.260
whatever it

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:37.440
is

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:37.840
that's a

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.220
pretty good

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:38.580
one

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.160
okay

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:41.640
so

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.340
people can

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:43.900
check that

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.140
out

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.580
that's

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:44.860
that's

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.380
pretty fun

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:45.960
following on

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.180
that

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.020
who knows

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:48.340
maybe

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.160
I might

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:49.520
do some

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:49.840
more fun

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.040
stuff

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:50.560
with songs

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.220
later

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:51.740
as well

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.040
with some

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:52.240
of these

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:52.500
episodes

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:52.800
I think

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.060
we can

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:53.280
do it

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:53.480
but we're

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:53.760
not doing

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:53.960
it this

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.140
episode

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:54.400
we've got

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:54.620
to play

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:54.720
around

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:54.920
so

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.540
another

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:55.900
thing to

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.180
announce

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:56.420
is

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:56.940
PyCon

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.740
Austria

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.840
is

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.600

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.120
and 7th

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.800

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.200
it's

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:05.620
opening

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:05.920
party

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.020
on

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:06.160
the

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.500
5th

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:06.780
I mean

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:06.940
who

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.180
wouldn't

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:07.340
want

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:07.520
to go

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:07.900
to a

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.400
party

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:08.640
in

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.060
Austria

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:09.920
have

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.080
some

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.260
good

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:10.600
beer

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.780
it'd

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:11.840
be

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.100
great

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:12.480
yeah

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:12.980
so

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:13.560
I met

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:13.720
some

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:13.780
of

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:13.860
the

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.040
folks

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.320
behind

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:14.600
this

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.000
at

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.120
PyCon

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:16.940
Slovakia

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.660
2018

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.080
when I

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:18.360
was there

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:18.760
giving a

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.040
talk

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.420
and

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:20.700
they're

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:20.860
putting

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.000
this

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.260
on

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:21.480
I

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:21.920
think

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.080
it

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:22.200
is

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:22.420
free

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:22.600
yeah

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:22.900
attendance

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:23.120
is

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:23.320
free

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:23.500
but

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:23.760
space

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:23.900
is

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:24.120
limited

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:24.340
so

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:24.440
you

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:24.560
still

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:24.700
got

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:24.820
to

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:25.040
sign

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:25.240
up

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.640
so

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:25.820
if

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.260
you're

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.240
near

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:27.680
Austria

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.060
in

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.480
Austria

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.000
or

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.220
can

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:29.560
take

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.340
a

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.400
train

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.300
over

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:32.620
to

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.040
Austria

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:33.660
and

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:33.900
like

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.020
to

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:34.120
do

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:34.340
that

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:34.920
you

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.000
know

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.160
check

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:35.260
it

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:35.400
out

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:35.680
I

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:35.840
would

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.320
absolutely

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:36.600
go

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:36.760
if

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:36.880
I

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.120
could

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:37.840
but

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.240
it

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:38.820
intersects

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.080
with

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.720
some

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.020
family

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.280
stuff

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:40.520
that I

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:40.840
can't

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.020
get

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:41.240
out

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:41.440
of

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.700
so

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.600
I'm

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:43.740
not

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:43.900
going

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.080
this

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:44.300
year

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.000
unfortunately

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.500
because

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:45.640
of

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:45.740
the

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:45.960
dates

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.260
but

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:46.500
it

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:46.820
still

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.880
would

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.000
be

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.260
fun

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:48.400
and

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:48.560
people

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:48.700
can

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:48.880
check

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:48.980
it

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:49.120
out

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.340
right

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.440
yeah

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.640
another

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.020
one

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:55.640
Leonard

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.100
Richardson

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.360

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:57.720
guy

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.140
who

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:58.540
created

00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:58.980
beautiful

00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.400

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.160
this

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.400

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:02.300
want

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:02.600
little

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:02.760
bit

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.020

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.300
one

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:05.640
was

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:12.780
apparently

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.060
this

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:13.260
is

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:13.500
a

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:13.780
pretty

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:13.980

the

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:04.440
show

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:04.700
with

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.060
something

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.660
special

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.040
and

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:06.600
unexpected

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:06.980
for

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:07.300
people

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:07.900
okay

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.980
in order

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.300
to

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:12.940
do

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.160

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.520
the

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:13.900
end

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.140
I

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:14.320
think

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:14.520
let's

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:14.620
do

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:14.740
the

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:14.900
joke

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.320
first

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.000
I

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.180
I'm

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:16.840
jokes

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.480
yeah

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.660
so

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.600
you

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:19.700
know

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:19.820
what

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:19.960
it's

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.160
like

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.280
to

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:20.380
go

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:20.500
to

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:20.720
stack

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.000
overflow

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.440
right

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.800
it's

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.100
not

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.620
it's

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.300
super

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:25.620
helpful

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:25.940
but

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.060
it

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:26.200
can

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:26.340
be

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:26.480
a

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:26.600
little

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.180
prickly

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:27.560
let's

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:27.840
say

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.980
yeah

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:29.280
yeah

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:29.600
you'll

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:29.840
submit

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:29.980
a

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:30.240
question

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:30.400
like

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:30.520
well

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:30.640
that

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:30.940
question

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.080
was

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.380
answered

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:31.680
seven

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.300
years

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:33.460
ago

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:33.660
over

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:33.920
there

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.660
like

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.100
well

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:35.560
yes

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:35.740
but

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:35.880
it

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.120
doesn't

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:36.300
work

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:36.440
that

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:36.580
way

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:36.860
anymore

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.280
or

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.700
you

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:38.820
know

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:38.960
you

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.160
just

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:39.340
you

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:39.700
shouldn't

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.020
why

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:40.100
are

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:40.200
you

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:40.380
even

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:40.600
asking

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:40.780
this

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:40.880
you

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.080
shouldn't

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:41.200
do

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:41.400
this

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.620
right

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.520
so

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.080
this

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.280
comes

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:43.540
back

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:43.700
to

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.000
a

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
very

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.020
common

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:47.300
sort

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:47.420
of

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:47.780
question

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:48.020
you

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:48.160
know

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:48.780
optimist

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:49.100
versus

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:49.820
pessimist

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.280
but

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:50.400
we

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:50.560
have

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:50.700
a

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:50.940
third

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:51.500
category

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.320
a

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:52.600
stack

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.380
overflowist

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:53.760
okay

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.200
so

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:55.500
here's

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:55.620
a

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.020
glass

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:56.380
it's

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.060
exactly

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.820
50%

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.200
full

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.300
of

00:27:59.300 --> 00:27:59.600
water

00:27:59.600 --> 00:27:59.920
I mean

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.200
you can

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:00.480
debate

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.300
it's

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:01.820
100%

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.000
full

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.140
but

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:02.380
whatever

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:02.640
like

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:02.940
that's

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.340
not

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:03.500
the

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:03.680
debate

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.040
a

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:04.320
chemistry

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:04.740
joke

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.560

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:19.300
question

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.160
and

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.320
so

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:22.580
I

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:22.860
in

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:23.620
notes

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:23.840
I

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.360
entitled

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:24.600
the

joke

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.080
that's

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:25.200
a

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.420
stupid

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:25.780
cup

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:26.180
or

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:26.400
stupid

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:26.840
glass

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.500
I

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:28.760
like

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.200
it

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:29.800
pretty

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:29.960
good

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.200
right

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:30.760
yeah

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.660
and

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:31.860
then

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.340
like

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:32.640
of

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:32.900
course

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.620
I'm

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.420
the

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:34.680
nerd

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:34.820
in

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:34.960
me

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.100
is

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:35.340
looking

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:35.540
at

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:35.720
this

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.060
going

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:36.760
well

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.260
visually

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:37.620
it's

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:37.920
halfway

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.260
up

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:38.560
but

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.040
since

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.300
the

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:39.520
cup

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:39.720
is

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.140
wider

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:40.340
at

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:40.500
the

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:40.820
top

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.540
it's

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:42.780
got

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:42.960
more

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.680
more air

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:43.900
than

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:44.220
it does

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:44.880
I

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.020
would

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.200
say

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.720
pessimist

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.120
wins

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.560
comes

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:47.760
in

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.020
second

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:48.580
optimist

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.040
no

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:49.320
no

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:49.520
no

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.400
that's

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:50.480
a

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:50.700
stupid

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:50.980
cup

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.320
okay

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:51.800
that's

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:51.900
a

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.160
stupid

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:52.480
cup

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:52.900
all right

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.120
you ready

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:53.360
for the

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:53.560
last

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:53.780
thing

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.380
this is

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:54.540
pretty

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:54.800
awesome

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.180
this is

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:55.480
this is

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:55.600
pretty

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:55.840
wild

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.140
we live

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:56.280
in

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:56.680
we live

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:56.780
in

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.060
incredible

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:57.420
times

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.800
so I've

00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.000
started

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.360
doing this

00:28:59.360 --> 00:28:59.680
thing over

00:28:59.680 --> 00:28:59.840
at

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.020
talk

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.340
python

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.040
this is

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.280
only

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:02.940
tangentially

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.240
the

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:03.840
actual

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.240
topic

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.720
it is

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:05.960
but it

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.400
isn't

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:06.680
I've

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:06.840
started

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.040
doing

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:07.180
this

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:07.300
thing

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:07.580
called

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.240
episode

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:08.560
deep

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:08.740
dive

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.000
so I

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:09.240
wrote up

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.440
on the

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:09.580
talk

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:09.880
python

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.340
blog

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:10.860
introducing

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.460
episode

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:11.800
deep

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.200
dives

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.460
at

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:12.680
talk

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.020
python

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.300
and so

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:14.620
if you

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:14.900
go to

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.420
any

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.580
I'm

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:17.880
embarrassed

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.260
to say

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:18.660
it took me

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:18.900
a while

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.380
to understand

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:19.900
the snorkel

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.400
reference

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.840
deep dive

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.200
yeah well

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:23.940
you got to

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.340
pick something

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:24.700
from your

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:24.900
font

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.260
awesome

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.120
icons

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:26.860
and I'd

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.040
already

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.380
used up

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:27.740
some other

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:27.980
stuff

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.720
so it's

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.140
a snorkel

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:29.460
as the

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:29.760
icon

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.100
to click

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:30.420
the button

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.060
I like

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:31.260
it

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.520
so now

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.140
for every

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:33.460
episode

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:33.780
that I

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.260
publish

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:34.940
I'm

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.160
putting

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.480
together

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:35.760
what's

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:35.920
called

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.240
a deep

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.540
dive

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.180
and

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:37.720
actually

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.480
it's

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:38.940
ironic

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.340
that

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.360
the older

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:40.660
ones

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.080
are better

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.740
because

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.280
the more

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:42.640
of them

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.040
I've

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.320
done

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.200
the better

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:44.420
I've

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:44.700
got

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.040
at

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.260
you know

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:46.440
figure

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:46.660
them

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:46.920
out

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920
let's

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.340
yeah

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:48.780
it's so

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.000
weird

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.700
so here

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:49.900
let's

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.020
see

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.320
space

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:50.760
science

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.260
does

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:51.360
this

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:51.500
have

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:51.600
a

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:51.720
deep

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.000
dive

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.360
it

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:52.560
does

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:52.820
okay

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.500
so

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:53.860
space

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.320
science

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:54.680
this

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:54.900
one

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.080
is

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.440
I

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:55.780
interviewed

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.500
Thomas

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:56.960
Albin

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.740
about his

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.000
YouTube

00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.400
channel

00:29:59.400 --> 00:29:59.840
and his

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.180
work

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.020
I think

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:01.180
it was

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:01.280
a

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:01.520
European

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:01.880
space

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.160
agency

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:03.680
and so

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:03.880
on

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.640
but

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.560
instead

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:05.780
of just

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:05.940
having

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:06.100
the

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:06.280
show

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.480
notes

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:06.660
now

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:06.740
it

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:06.860
has

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:06.980
this

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.120
thing

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.280
called

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:07.440
the

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:07.620
deep

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:07.980
dive

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.960
which

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.240
comes

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:09.420
into

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:09.560
the

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:09.960
background

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.240
it

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:10.380
says

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:10.660
hey

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.120
if

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:11.300
you're

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:11.560
new

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:11.700
to

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.080
Python

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.960
these

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.080
are

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:13.180
the

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:13.400
types

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:13.540
of

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:13.740
things

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:13.940
you'll

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:14.060
want

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:14.220
to

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.000
research

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.240
a

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:15.340
little

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:15.500
bit

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:15.640
to

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.060
understand

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:16.580
this

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:16.920
topic

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.180
really

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:17.420
well

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:17.620
like

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:17.800
this

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.000
one's

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.220
about

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:18.760
visualization

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.120
so

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:19.240
it

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:19.440
talks

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:19.660
about

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:19.900
map

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.080
plot

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:20.300
11

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:20.960
pandas

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:21.820
and

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.620
spicy pie

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:22.800
and

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.540
then it

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:24.900
goes into

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.220
all

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:25.440
the

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.200
takeaways

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:26.600
and

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:26.920
links

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.140
and

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:27.720
documents

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:27.920
and

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.260
tools

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:28.640
and

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.260
excellent

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:30.560
stuff

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:30.700
to

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:30.820
just

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:30.980
make

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:31.100
it

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:31.240
way

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:31.420
more

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:31.660
useful

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:31.920
right

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.100
okay

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.480
that's

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:33.580
nice

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:33.780
so

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.320
yeah

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:34.600
thanks

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.520
we might

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:35.760
start

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:35.960
doing

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.100
that

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:36.340
here

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:36.880
I'm

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.100
trying

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.260
to

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:37.540
decide

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:37.820
because

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:38.020
we're

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.280
show

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:38.460
notes

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:38.620
are

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:38.980
pretty

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.360
close

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:39.500
to

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:39.760
this

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.080
but

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:40.240
they're

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:40.400
not

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:40.860
exactly

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.260
we

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:41.400
can

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:41.600
play

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:41.780
with

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:41.880
it

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.080
but

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.340
you know

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:42.520
we've

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:42.660
looked

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:42.780
at

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:42.900
a

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.020
little

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:43.320
right

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.780
is

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.180
a ton

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:45.280
of

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:45.440
work

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:45.620
though

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:45.820
I

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:45.980
don't

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.120
have

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.200
them

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.320
all

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:46.500
done

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:46.840
I'm

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.080
back

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.160
to

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:48.280
like

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:48.740
2022

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:49.540
and

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:49.740
I've

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:49.920
got

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.120
to

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:50.260
go

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:50.460
back

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:50.580
to

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:51.060
2016

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:51.420
so

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:51.620
there

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:51.680
you

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:51.860
go

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.880
but

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.440
many

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:53.600
of

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:53.740
the

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:53.880
new

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.060
ones

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:54.160
are

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:54.360
done

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:54.640
which

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:54.900
is

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:55.380
awesome

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.720
so

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.480
here's

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:58.620
the

00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:58.860
thing

00:30:58.860 --> 00:30:59.060
that

00:30:59.060 --> 00:30:59.700
here's

00:30:59.700 --> 00:30:59.840
the

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.060
thing

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:00.240
I'm

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:00.320
going

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:00.420
to

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:00.680
close

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:00.920
out

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.100
the

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.260
show

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:01.460
with

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:01.600
that

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:01.720
I

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:01.960
think

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.260
is

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.480
crazy

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:03.680
and

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:03.780
I

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:03.900
think

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.160
people

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:04.400
will

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:04.820
enjoy

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:05.420
this

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:05.600
is

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:05.860
kind

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:05.940
of

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.040
a

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.300
separate

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:06.840
topic

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.100
notebook

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:11.520
LM

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.200
have

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:12.320
you

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:12.540
played

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:12.680
with

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:12.920
notebook

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.260
LM

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.200
no

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.080
so

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.440
notebook

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:15.820
LM

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.300
is

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:16.760
originally

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.080
came

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:17.300
out

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:17.520
it's

do

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.000
the

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.420
researchers

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:33.760

about

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:34.400
this

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:34.840
and

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.000
it's

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.320
based

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:35.520
on

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:35.740
all

the

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.040
most

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.460
insane

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:37.820
thing

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:37.960
and

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.080
this

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.140
is

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:38.260
what

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:38.400
we're

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:38.540
going

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:38.620
to

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:38.840
close

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:38.960

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:39.540
with

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:39.980
is

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:40.060
you

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:40.180
can

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:40.400
push

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.500
literally

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.040
you don't

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:42.260
have to

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:42.520
give it

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:42.900

you just

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:43.780
push a

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:43.940
button

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:44.220
and say

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.100
create a

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:45.700
talk show

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.100
like

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.480
similar to

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:47.720
what we're

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.120
doing here

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:48.900
talk show

podcast

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:51.680
episode

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.720
of this

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.100
paper

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.580
it is

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:54.880
so

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.260
insane

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:55.460
so

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:55.760
if I

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:55.940
was

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.540
researching

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.300
I don't

00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:58.420
know

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:58.820
if I was

00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.300
researching

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.660
something

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.360

Django

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:03.200
and

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:03.460
somebody

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:03.780
written

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.060
up a

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.000
report

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.320
I could

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:05.660
upload

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:05.940
that

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.220
and I

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:06.340
could

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:06.520
just

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:06.700
say

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:06.980
hey

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.960
I

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.220
want

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:08.400

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:12.460
trade-offs

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:12.780
and it

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.060
brings

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.380
in

right

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:15.280
it's

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:15.460
not

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:15.780
just

kind

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:17.220

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:17.620
chat

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.160
GPT

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.000

that

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:19.300
it

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:19.620
knows

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:19.980
everything

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:20.240
and

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:20.380
then

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:20.540
it

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:20.860
also

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:21.120
just

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:21.400
talks

it

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:22.440
is

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.780
insane

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.600
so

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.140
going

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.120
if

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:47.200
you

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:47.320
want

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:47.400
to

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:47.520
hear

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:47.860
it

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:53.100
so

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:53.320
there's

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:53.520
nothing

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:53.880
else

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.460
but

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:54.580
I'm

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:54.640
going

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:54.720
to

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:54.980
play

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.220
this

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:55.800
because

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.160
it

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:56.320
is

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:56.520
an

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.140
insane

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:57.600
view

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:57.780
into

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:57.960
what

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:58.080
is

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:58.440
possible

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:58.620
so

00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:58.780
what

00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:58.900
I

00:32:58.900 --> 00:32:59.040
did

00:32:59.040 --> 00:32:59.140
is

00:32:59.140 --> 00:32:59.260
I

00:32:59.260 --> 00:32:59.460
took

00:32:59.460 --> 00:32:59.680
this

00:32:59.680 --> 00:32:59.920
deep

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.180
dive

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:00.900
conversation

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.760
blog

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.100
post

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.120
gave

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:04.240
it

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:04.380
to

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:04.660
notebook

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:04.980
LM

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.140
and

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:05.240
I

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:05.400
said

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:05.620
I

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:05.780
want

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:05.860

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:05.960
hear

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.160
people

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:06.400
talk

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:06.560
about

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:06.720
it

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.280
so

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:07.420
I'm

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:07.480
going

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:07.560
to

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:07.740
drop

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:07.920
that

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.140
in

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:08.580
and

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:08.760
people

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:08.920
can

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.040
hear

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.200
about

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.300
it

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:09.540
now

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.040
I

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:10.220
think

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:10.360
your

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:10.520
mind

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:10.600
is

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:10.680
going

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:10.680
to

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:10.800
be

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.040
blown

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.320
you

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.340
sent

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:15.580
this

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:15.720
to

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:15.960
me

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.180
and

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:16.320
I

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.600
totally

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:17.900
thought

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:18.120
you

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:18.340
was

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:20.360
doing

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:20.520
a

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:20.980
podcast

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:21.280
about

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:21.480
your

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:21.700
deep

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.020
dives

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:22.760
it's

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.380
crazy

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:24.820
if

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:24.920
you

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.120
haven't

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.260
heard

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:25.420
it

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:25.940
it

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.240
has

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:26.900
interruptions

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.140
like

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:27.680
oh

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:27.980
yeah

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.600
it's

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.000
got

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:31.200
that

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.780
artificial

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.280
back

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:33.440
and

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:33.680
forth

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:33.960
but

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.240
it's

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:34.460
done

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:34.600
in

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:34.720
a

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:34.920
really

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.240
nice

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:35.500
way

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:35.860
it's

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.180
not

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:37.420
just

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:37.680
speech

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:37.880
to

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.100
text

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:38.240
it

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:38.340
is

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:38.540
something

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.220
entirely

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.640
unworldly

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:41.900
it is

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.200
weird

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.840
and

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:42.960
I

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.080
thought

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:43.180
it'd

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:43.260
be

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:43.440
fun

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:43.560
to

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:43.740
close

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:43.880
out

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.000
the

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.160
show

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:44.360
just

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:44.860
to

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:45.020
give

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:45.300
people

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:45.480
a

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:45.660
weird

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:45.960
glimpse

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.160
into

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:46.360
this

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:46.600
world

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:46.960
and

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.160
it'll

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:47.360
talk

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:47.600
about

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:47.740
the

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:47.920
deep

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.120
dives

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:48.360
you

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:48.580
care

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.220
cool

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.040
all
