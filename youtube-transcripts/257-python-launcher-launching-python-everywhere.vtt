00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
- Hey, all.


00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.840
- Hello, everybody.


00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.840
- Hey, Brian. - Hey, everybody.


00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.200
- So, are we going?


00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.640
Nice.


00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.240
So, welcome everybody to the stream.


00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.440
I'm excited to be here with you today.


00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.000
We have guests, so let's kick it off with the show.


00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.240
- Kick it off, Brian.


00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.200
- Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes,


00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.600
where we deliver Python news and headlines


00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.540
directly to your earbuds.


00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.000
This is episode 257, recorded November 3rd.


00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.320
recorded November 3rd, 2021.


00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.740
Hey, it's November, cool.


00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.160
I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.260
- I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.440
- I'm Morley Sakarbo.


00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
- Well, welcome Morley.


00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.180
We haven't even really met other than a few seconds ago.


00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.160
So can you tell us who you are?


00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.320
- Yeah, my name is Morley Sakarbo


00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.600
and I met Michael Kennedy a couple of weeks ago


00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.800
at a Pi Bay event in San Francisco.


00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.120
- A fantastic Pi Bay event.


00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.720
For people who cannot see it,


00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.480
you should go to pybay.com and just see the graphics.


00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.720
This is the conference outside at a car area.


00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.680
So awesome, so great to see you there.


00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.080
- Right.


00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.560
And so I help Grace Law organize that event.


00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.600
She and I have been working over the past couple years


00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.320
and it's a fantastic community.


00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.880
And I've been in San Francisco for the past three years


00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.960
and I'm actually, I work for the defense department


00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.320
and I lead a software development team


00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.160
and we work on optimizing software processes.


00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.360
And on the weekends, I'm a commercial pilot.


00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.920
So I do fly and I do teach student pilots.


00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.980
So that's generally speaking who I am.


00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.880
- That's so awesome.


00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.360
- That's cool.


00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.960
On my side job is a professional pilot.


00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.640
- Yeah, including jets, right?


00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.080
- Yeah, I do fly corporate jets.


00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.640
- That sounds so fun.


00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.820
I think that's so neat.


00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.280
You know, it's good to get away from the keyboard


00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.760
in the offices, especially when with COVID happening


00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.640
and everything is harder to get out around,


00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.920
like you really get away, you get up in the sky.


00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.360
- I do get away, but you gotta be careful, right?


00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.860
Because you're going across a different ecosystem, right?


00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.120
So you gotta make sure that you're well protected,


00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.560
that you're taking all the precautions


00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.840
that are required to not get sick, but it's an adventure.


00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.640
I do like to get around sometimes.


00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.800
- Awesome.


00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.760
And Teddy on the live stream says,


00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.480
- It's you invited James Fon, I think.


00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.160
- I think we may have, actually.


00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.600
Yeah, where do you park your Austin Martin?


00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.000
No, seriously, let's kick this off, Brian.


00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.480
With something also, Morley,


00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.440
you also are involved with Django stuff, right?


00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.320
In San Francisco?


00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.120
- Yes, just a little bit.


00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.180
By the way, first off,


00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.360
I do want to say thank you very much, Michael.


00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.200
So many years ago, I was overseas


00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200
and I was in Qatar at the time


00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.040
and I got started learning how to code.


00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.360
And Python was the language that was,


00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.520
was, at least from my perspective, you know, something I could use in my data science perspective.


00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.680
And working with you through Talk Python to me was extremely helpful for me, learning


00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.400
how to code, just being with a community, and I think that was extremely helpful. It's


00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.960
gotten me in different places, only because I started to learn how to code and got involved


00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.880
with your podcast many years ago. So thank you for that.


00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.280
- That's amazing, thank you so much.


00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.560
Yeah, it really, it means a lot.


00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.160
And it's easy to forget Brian and I just sit here


00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.960
at our desk and chat about stuff,


00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.240
but it really helps connect people,


00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.480
especially if they're new or they're coming from places


00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.240
where there's not a big community they can drop into.


00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.160
It helps people get more integrated quicker.


00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.000
And I think that's fantastic.


00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.840
- Yeah, and it's just the way you guys talk, right?


00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.080
I mean, it's just, you're talking to me


00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.400
as opposed to talking to an audience or, you know,


00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.180
a group of large crowd or something like that.


00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.160
So I'm listening to a podcast and I'm going,


00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.480
this is relatable and I can actually go out


00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.680
and do a little bit more research on a package


00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.240
on a topic that you guys are talking about.


00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.580
So it's really good.


00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.480
- Nice.


00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480
- Yeah, fantastic.


00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.760
- Speaking of packages, let's talk about Django.


00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.680
- Yeah, let's start with Django here.


00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.120
So I don't do that much Django.


00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.760
Do more on the micro framework side of things,


00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.640
but Django is super important.


00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.840
And when cool stuff happens there,


00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.520
I wanna make sure to give it a shout out.


00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.960
So we're Django 4, I mean, a beta, but still Django 4.


00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.320
Morley, have you been tracking this?


00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.360
You excited about this?


00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.320
- I am tracking it.


00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.420
I'm excited about it.


00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.800
Yep, absolutely, yep.


00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.880
- Yeah, super cool.


00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.560
So Django 4.0 beta one was released.


00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.640
I feel like it was Django one for a really long time


00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.920
and then Django two, and then, you know,


00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.760
blow the doors off.


00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.240
We're going three, four, five, six, right?


00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.560
We're gonna be at Django 20 soon enough.


00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.240
But this is really good news.


00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.040
The beta one, so it means feature-free,


00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.200
bug fixes only type of thing, is out.


00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.420
And if you're interested in this, you can try it out now.


00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.640
Notable changes here for what's coming along.


00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.600
First of all, it's only compatible


00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.520
with Python 3.8 and beyond, which is pretty fantastic.


00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.800
And if you want older support, as in all the way back


00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.360
to 3.6, you got to go back to Django 3.0 series, 3.2.


00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.320
So I think that's pretty interesting as well,


00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.000
the sort of rapid adoption of new Python, right?


00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.480
This is like two years of Python and not more.


00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.540
So things that are new, there's stuff about time zones,


00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.860
which I'm not going to bore you with,


00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.860
but database stuff is cool, right?


00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.800
One of the things that I think Django is really renowned for


00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.640
is its web front end plus database integration, right?


00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.200
Wouldn't you say so, Morley?


00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.600
- Yes, absolutely.


00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.520
- Yeah, I think it's the, not just the,


00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.120
well, you have an ORM that's built in,


00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.840
but you've got the admin sections that know about the models


00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.740
and all kinds of stuff.


00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.440
We're actually gonna come back to that


00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.880
as well later in this episode.


00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.880
But one of the new things is functional unique constraints.


00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.480
So like I can only insert this record


00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.240
if there's not already one that matches,


00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.320
say the email address for a user.


00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.600
So now what you can do is you can create functionally


00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.640
unique constraints with expressions and database functions.


00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.020
So for example, you could have an index,


00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.600
which is a unique constraint where you have


00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.280
the lowercase of the first name,


00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.400
the lowercase of the second name,


00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.540
descending, I guess, for the index bit,


00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.640
but that doesn't really matter for the constraint.


00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.320
And then you can give it a name,


00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.080
like first name, last name must be unique constraint.


00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.820
And so that's pretty awesome, right?


00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.620
You can say, I can't have two users with the same name.


00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.780
I'm not sure how practical that is,


00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.740
but as an example, it makes good sense.


00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.100
Yeah, poor Joe Smith or Michael Kennedy for that matter.


00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.500
Like probably gonna not make it in


00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.440
after a couple of hundred thousand users.


00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.380
Let's see, they have the script password hasher.


00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.380
So you do not, hopefully you are not storing raw passwords.


00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.620
Every time I see a website that says,


00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.480
your password cannot be more than eight characters.


00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.940
I'm like, that had better not be a Varchar 8 field.


00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.780
I don't know what you're doing,


00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.180
but I'm starting to get really worried


00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.740
'cause the size of the output of a hash


00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.420
is always the same size regardless of the input.


00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.380
Anyway, so new password hasher that's more secure


00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.200
and recommended over what was previously


00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.020
the default of pbkdf2, right?


00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.620
It's however not the default


00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.980
because you have to now install OpenSSL 1.0 or above,


00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.620
which is not super high, but it's still,


00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.660
it's not super new version.


00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.420
All right, then Redis, there's now a dedicated


00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.220
built-in Redis cache as the caching tier.


00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.840
So you can set up caching in Django and say, cache here.


00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.560
Now one of the options is Redis.


00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.240
Yes, you could do that previously,


00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.900
but now it's like a built-in thing.


00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.460
So you don't have to do that outside of.


00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.300
- That's cool.


00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.460
- Yeah, that's cool, right?


00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.400
- That's very cool.


00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.780
- Yeah, then template-based form rendering.


00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.340
So enhanced customization of forms, form sets,


00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.300
Airs list and so on using the template engine.


00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.020
So pretty cool.


00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.440
It's not a huge bunch of changes,


00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.080
but they all sound really nice.


00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.420
- Yeah, the support of which Python versions is pretty big,


00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.700
but I mean, come on people.


00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.540
- Yeah.


00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.360
- It's an application.


00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.620
You can pick your whatever Python version you want.


00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.740
- Yeah, that's right.


00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.740
Out there in the live stream, Alvaro,


00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.260
hey, says, "I guess that dropping versions


00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.380
"helps to reduce the number of wheels to build


00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.800
"and also to test, right?


00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.080
probably so CI is probably faster,


00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.000
you can take advantage of some of the newer things


00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.120
and just count on them being there, which is great.


00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.960
- Yeah, definitely.


00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.920
- Also, speaking of versions, Sam Morley,


00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.520
hey Sam, great to see you again,


00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.200
says getting my boss to agree to drop Python 3.4 was a task.


00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.040
(laughs)


00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.800
That's been a while since 3.4 is out.


00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.720
I actually remember, I think, where I was.


00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.000
I was out in Redlands, California,


00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.360
when that came out, which is pretty interesting.


00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.460
Anyway, don't know why that came to mind.


00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.100
Is this stuff exciting to you?


00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.780
More like someone does more Django


00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.080
than probably Brian or me?


00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.140
- No, it's very exciting to me.


00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.740
Just being able to see just the iterations of Django


00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.540
is very, very helpful to the community.


00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.660
I started with Django 3, so this is,


00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.660
these few iterations have been very helpful,


00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.140
especially Redis for me.


00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.900
- Yeah, the Redis is exciting.


00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:23.740
- Yeah, for sure.


00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.260
- Brian?


00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.380
- Well, I have to apologize.


00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.040
I don't remember who pushed us this way,


00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.580
but somebody on Twitter said,


00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.300
hey, you guys should maybe talk about Pi once in a while,


00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.940
like just Pi itself, the P-Y, the application.


00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.900
So Pi or pi.exe, it's the Python launcher.


00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.660
This has been bundled with Python 3.3.


00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.980
So it's been there for a while, but I've kind,


00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.940
to be honest, I've kind of ignored it


00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.580
because it's a Windows only thing.


00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.760
And I work in multiple, I do work on Windows,


00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.820
but I also work in Mac and Linux and multiple environments.


00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.460
So I really don't wanna change my workflow just for one.


00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.460
So, but the idea is that you just type PI


00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.020
and it picks the latest version


00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.980
that you have installed on your system.


00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:17.380
It's kind of neat, but I didn't really get the feel for it.


00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:22.380
But then Brett Cannon wrote this thing called Pi Launcher


00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.860
that is the same thing, but it works on Mac


00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.180
and it works on Linux and it works on


00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.380
a whole bunch of other stuff like Arch Linux


00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.320
and really anything that Rust can run on,


00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.560
I think it works on, which is like almost everything.


00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.020
So this is pretty neat, but why is it neat?


00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.420
So I'm like, still, why did Brett spend time


00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.860
making this work?


00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.760
And so I started changing my workflow for this.


00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.140
And I gotta say, it's kind of life-changing.


00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.520
The big thing is I don't have to care


00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.380
where Python's installed anymore.


00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.520
So I have this set up on my Mac.


00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.120
I've got it set up on, I included it


00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.880
in the install on Windows.


00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.020
And then you just say,


00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.460
py, like for instance, you can say py --list,


00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.160
and you get like all of the,


00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.520
I don't have the example here,


00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.180
but you get all of the versions listed out,


00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.700
And it lists, it tells you where they are too,


00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.860
but you don't really have to care.


00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.500
And in the Pi launcher version on Linux or Mac,


00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.460
it shows the paths right away.


00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.140
On the Windows version, you have to say list paths,


00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.500
but it's still pretty easy if you wanna know where they are.


00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.820
But basically you don't have to care


00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.100
where things are anymore.


00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.820
So, and I also don't have to care where they are


00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.900
in the path, like in my path variable.


00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.500
So the Python version I want, is it the first one?


00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.340
The second one?


00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.220
Did I install something and mess it up?


00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.460
Like if I install Python 3.10,


00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.060
but I also want to test on 3.6,


00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.980
so I installed 3.6 later,


00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.940
where does that show up in the path?


00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.860
I don't have to care anymore


00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.860
because my workflow is mostly around virtual environments.


00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.780
So I say like Python-mvnv,


00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.260
and I create a virtual environment,


00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.660
and I create it with the most recent Python version,


00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.300
no matter where they are in the path,


00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.420
where they're located.


00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.460
(coughs)


00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.700
And then if I want to test like a three eight,


00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.460
something on three eight or three nine,


00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.460
I can either, I can just type a pi dash 3.8 or 3.9.


00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.900
And then it just automatically runs that version.


00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.220
So I can run a script in Python three eight easily like


00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.660
that, or I can run it with,


00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.060
I can create a virtual environment,


00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.980
a three eight virtual environment really easily.


00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.140
And then, then I still don't,


00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.180
basically I don't have to care where things are installed


00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.940
And I love that.


00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.780
So yeah.


00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.820
- The other thing that I really like,


00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.180
sorry if I missed you hearing you say this is,


00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.180
once you create the virtual environment,


00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.940
subsequent calls to Pi will use that environment


00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.500
long as you're either in that directory


00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.540
or in a sub directory of others.


00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.060
So you don't have to activate the virtual environment.


00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.300
Like long as traversing up the hierarchy


00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.860
hits a .ve and v directories,


00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.580
"Okay, that's the most appropriate Python."


00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.800
- Does it work that way?


00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.640
- That's what it says,


00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.600
and like see the code sample right there?


00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.100
Look right underneath the, what's the next paragraph, right?


00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.220
It says, "Subsequent uses of Py


00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.580
"will then use that virtual environment


00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.260
"as long as it is the current or higher directory,


00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.940
"no environment activation required."


00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.980
- That's pretty cool.


00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.100
- Yeah, yeah. - That's very cool.


00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.480
That's very cool. - Yeah, it's so nice.


00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.900
'Cause that way you can set up your file system,


00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.540
you don't have to remember to activate it.


00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.960
Like certainly it's not common,


00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.760
but it is not also uncommon that I'm like,


00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.120
Pip install this thing.


00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.160
Oh, it went to the wrong place.


00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.260
You know what I mean?


00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.700
- Configuration is extremely important, right?


00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.880
So this is very good.


00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.100
- Yeah, yeah.


00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.200
And ZDocs on livestream,


00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.920
hey, says what's the main difference from this to pyenv?


00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.320
I think that that's one of them, right?


00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.560
pyenv, you've got to do pyenv run.


00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.840
You've got to like start the shell


00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.740
and I think this one is sort of,


00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.200
it's more like node packages or node modules.


00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.560
Like as long as it finds something there,


00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.080
like, okay, that's the project I'm in, let's run.


00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.600
- Yeah, and pyenv does these shim things


00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.920
to change which you can set up, which one you find.


00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.600
And I just, that makes it weird to me.


00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.240
It makes my system have state


00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.080
that I have to remember where it is.


00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.480
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've activated Python 3.7.


00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.960
So now it stays that way.


00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.800
but you've changed it, right?


00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.000
Okay. - So anyway,


00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.400
this has changed my life for the better and it's great.


00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.880
So thanks, Brett.


00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.240
- Yeah. - And now I use it


00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.720
on Windows too, so.


00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.100
- Fantastic. - Yeah.


00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.180
- All right.


00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:57.680
Up next, oh, I almost closed what you're talking about,


00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.660
more like. (laughing)


00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.840
Yeah, you're on the data science side of the world.


00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.260
- Yeah. - So bring us


00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.480
some data science news.


00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.480
- No, this is good, right?


00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.400
So this is the State of AI Report 2021.


00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.520
It's a pretty extensive report that comes out every year,


00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.160
just surveying across the world, really,


00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.200
just the trends on data science.


00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.800
And so at the very top there, it has the actual report.


00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.880
It's a PowerPoint version.


00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.640
But in this report, it highlights just the need


00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.220
for transformers being used, not just for NLP, right?


00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.220
so for looking at text, but it's also looking at audio,


00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.960
it's also looking at video,


00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.560
and it's also looking at protein transcription, for example.


00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.480
So it's, transformers are going beyond


00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.720
what they were intended to be,


00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.920
which was just primarily just NLP.


00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.040
- Right, yeah, give us a quick definition of a transformer.


00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.760
This is, how do you say,


00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.800
out of the natural language processing side of ML, right?


00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.600
- Right, so it's basically a sequence to sequence.


00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.440
So it's taking text from say English


00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.920
and converting it into an equivalent text


00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.880
into French or something else, right?


00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.320
So having a natural language processor transformer


00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.040
that can do that in a rather efficient basis


00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.760
is the whole idea of transformer space.


00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.280
So it's basically to take in again, tokens


00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:29.000
or just sequence from one language to another language.


00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.560
And so what this is saying now is that it isn't just


00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.280
constrained to just NLP, right?


00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.760
So now you can use it for looking at large data sets that


00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:44.560
are audio or large data sets that are imagery,


00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.440
and then converting that into something


00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.760
that you intended to do.


00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.960
So you're sticking those models, transfer learning, essentially.


00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.520
Take transfer learning from one model


00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.080
into another set of models.


00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.800
That's essentially what this is talking to.


00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.880
The idea here is that you're moving away from just NLP,


00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.920
that you're using it for computer vision,


00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.200
as it says on there,


00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.320
and even protein structure prediction.


00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.800
This is important to me because I actually,


00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.320
Michael, I don't know if I was telling you earlier,


00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.640
I spent some time in Qatar


00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.560
and I was studying Arabic there, right?


00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.840
So we would spend like hours just going through


00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.480
like transcription data sets and stuff.


00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.880
So now, having a transformer that can actually do that


00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.960
faster and maybe more accurate than,


00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.800
and in the past, I think it's extremely helpful


00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.640
for somebody like me.


00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.760
And the Hug and Face Transformer


00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.800
from a Python perspective,


00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.800
it's an extremely popular package on GitHub.


00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.600
And most people, it's got about 53,000 likes


00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.000
at this point or stars at this point.


00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.080
- Wow, that's comparable to Django


00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.760
and Flask level of popularity.


00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.040
- Yes, yes, yes.


00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.120
And they formed partnership with AWS.


00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.480
And so now you can spin up resources


00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.960
and enable AWS to use a Hugin space transformers.


00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.720
And again, those transformers have models


00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.620
that you can use for transcription.


00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.360
You can use them for a vision, a computer vision,


00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.080
or even like it's saying here


00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.400
for a protein structure predictions.


00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.720
- Yeah, cool.


00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.680
I'm very excited about what ML can do


00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.360
for medicine and biology research.


00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.400
I think, you know, machine learning


00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.120
and like recommendation engines


00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.300
and all sorts of stuff have good sides and bad sides


00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.540
and all kinds of things.


00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:33.540
But on the medical side, it seems like just mostly good.


00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.900
If you could say, actually we can cure this disease


00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.040
'cause we understand how to create something


00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.280
that will bind to this protein


00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.740
'cause now we know its actual shape.


00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.880
- Yeah. - That's great.


00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.920
- That's incredible, right?


00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.020
So predicting those shapes for protein is extremely important.


00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.940
I studied chemistry in college


00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.580
and a little bit of biochemistry when I was in college.


00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.420
And knowing the structures for proteins


00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.100
is like extremely important,


00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.980
but it takes a long time to model those structures, right?


00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.060
Now you can do it pretty easily on using transformers.


00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.420
I think it's a good thing.


00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.780
- Yeah, there's probably less well-known ways


00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.460
around more like physical chemistry as well, right?


00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.380
Like trying to understand different kinds of batteries


00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.540
and things like that, potentially,


00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.100
you know, don't get all depressed.


00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.320
- Well, I'm thinking that maybe we're not


00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.980
too terribly far away from universal translators


00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.320
in AirPods, that would be cool.


00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.160
- Yes.


00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.380
- Yeah.


00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.020
- That would be actually pretty amazing.


00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.920
I mean, we're pretty close with Google Translate.


00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.620
You can speak to it and then show it to someone


00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.940
in their language and then they can,


00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.540
I can think you can even make it read back


00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.580
and like you can really clumsily do it,


00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.340
but what you're envisioning is just like


00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.980
natural conversation, right?


00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.800
- Yeah.


00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.920
- Yeah, and have it be in their voice too.


00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.760
- Yeah.


00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.020
- That's pretty cool.


00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.460
- You know, you gotta wait five seconds


00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.740
for it to calculate a deep fake,


00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.420
then you can start talking.


00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.640
- Well now, but like our kids are gonna be like


00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.880
using these things probably.


00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.720
- Yeah, I know.


00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.740
I think you're totally right there.


00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.260
Absolutely.


00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.100
Awesome.


00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.260
Yeah, good pick there, Morley.


00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.100
Great.


00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.220
Before we thank our sponsor,


00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.540
I wanna just give a quick shout out to John Sheehan's


00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.960
comment here that Python launcher,


00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.060
the Pi thing that Brian spoke about,


00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.280
looks like a nice package and a better alternative


00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.100
to the Pi alias I created on my Linux laptop.


00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.380
Oh man, you and me both.


00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.380
I, my .zshrc is full of alias this, alias that,


00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:27.100
many of them starting with P to do something with Python.


00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.980
- Yeah, I mean, I used to list like,


00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.940
like make up aliases for PI 38, PI 39, just to,


00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.020
and then I couldn't remember if I had a dot in it or not.


00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.860
Was it 3.8?


00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.940
3, yeah, anyway.


00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.780
- Yeah, yeah, cool.


00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.460
All right, before we move on though,


00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.900
I do wanna tell you about our sponsor, Shortcut.


00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.820
Thank you, Shortcut, formerly Clubhouse,


00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.300
for sponsoring the show, check them out


00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.500
at shortcut.com/pythonbytes.


00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.300
Or Brian, do you know what else that people can do now?


00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.140
- What?


00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.140
- We've started adding chapters,


00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.180
chapter images, chapter links.


00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.980
So I guess you could even click the chapter link


00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.140
right here in your podcast player


00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.380
or in the podcast show notes.


00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.200
So that's pretty awesome.


00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.940
But however you get to them,


00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.200
thank you to Shortcut for sponsoring this episode.


00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.900
They've built simple project management tools


00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.460
that grow with your engineering team


00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.800
and don't get too complex, but are not too simplistic.


00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.140
So some of the highlights include team-based workflows.


00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.080
So individual teams can use Shortcuts default workflows


00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.980
or they can customize them.


00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.500
Organizational-wide goals and roadmaps


00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.260
led the overall organization to find workflows


00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.300
and then tie these smaller team ones


00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.300
into the larger workflow and kind of get a big organization wide view.


00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.500
VCS, version control integration.


00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.560
So it works with GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, and it can tie them,


00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:59.060
tie your items in your project management back over into what's happening there.


00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.620
And you can even do that from the command line, which is cool.


00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.860
As almost all web apps should have, but many don't.


00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.940
Shortcut has a bunch of keyboards,


00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.600
so you can use their power bar


00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.760
and use hotkeys all over their web app


00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.180
to just zoom around because someone like Brian,


00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.140
who would rather be in Vim mode


00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.960
and not take his hands off the keyboard,


00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.940
can cruise around.


00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.780
- Nice.


00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:25.600
- It does iteration planning


00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.420
and will automatically schedule how that should go along


00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.440
if you don't wanna customize it.


00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.440
So give it a try over at shortcut.com/pythonbytes


00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.400
'cause you shouldn't have to manage your project management.


00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.200
So yeah, thank you to Shortcut for sponsoring the show.


00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:45.580
Now, let's go back to Django.


00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.960
And I'm gonna tie this together.


00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.160
So Morley has a background in Django.


00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.840
Brian, you have clearly a bunch of testing.


00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.000
So let's talk about testing Django models.


00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.440
- Okay, awesome.


00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.960
- Yeah, so one of the problems you might need to do


00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.800
in your test is you are going to create some data models


00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.240
and then you wanna do stuff with them, right?


00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.440
you wanna pass them off to a function or whatever.


00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.360
And so that can be a bit of a hassle.


00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.160
So I wanna tell you about Model Bakery,


00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.720
which are smart fixtures for better,


00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.880
parenthesis Django tests.


00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.540
That's not quite there, but for better tests for Django code.


00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.680
So the idea is it's like Faker or Makaru


00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.440
or something like that, but for Django or our models.


00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.160
And it specifically understands things


00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.740
like relationships and whatnot.


00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.040
So pretty cool.


00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.820
You can come over here and do things like


00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.080
you've got your Django model defined as it does, right?


00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.660
Derivation models has fields which are columns,


00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.900
like email fields, character fields, and so on.


00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.300
And then when you wanna use it,


00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.940
you just go to the baker and say make a,


00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.300
you know, in this case, it's like a shop,


00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.540
like online e-commerce shop.


00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.180
So you can say shop.purchase history


00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.140
is the namespace of the class.


00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:03.960
And then guess what?


00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.840
it'll populate it with customers and emails


00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.680
and all kinds of stuff.


00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.280
That's cool, right?


00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.120
- Yeah, it is.


00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.280
It's very cool.


00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.100
- Yeah, and then you could also set up


00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.720
model to model relationships.


00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.600
So you can say, I want you to,


00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.200
when I create a purchase history, for example,


00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.000
it also has a products.


00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.840
So you can say, make the model to model relationships for me


00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.500
and mock those out as well.


00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.400
So then in your test,


00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.320
you can work with your purchase history object


00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.240
and say dot products and then loop over them,


00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.200
do count, whatever, right?


00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.960
It's like a collection of sub or related models


00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.340
that were baked up for you.


00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:45.560
Yeah, you can even go and say prepare,


00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.600
when prepare something to bake,


00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.320
when you ask somebody gives you a product,


00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.680
I want you to create me a product of five of these.


00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.120
And then as you make a purchase history,


00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.520
also use those five as the related object


00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.080
instead of guessing or randomizing or whatever.


00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.980
It's cool, right?


00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:05.820
- That's very cool.


00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.660
That's very cool.


00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.620
- Yeah, so if you're out there writing tests for Django,


00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.140
specifically the relationships,


00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.300
I think is where this is pretty interesting,


00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.140
but man, it's kind of interesting all over, right?


00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.340
It'll, I suspect it'll do things like create emails


00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.300
if the model says, here's an email field


00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.840
and it'll create integers if it says,


00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.540
here's an integer field and just take care of that for you.


00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.620
- Oh, that's very cool.


00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.020
- So is it another like a, another fake system


00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.340
or is it using a faker or something under the hood?


00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.180
Do you know?


00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.460
- Now that is a good question.


00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.080
What kind of project?


00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.220
(laughing)


00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.300
- I can go find out again.


00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.140
- No, no, no.


00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.020
Like, all right, so let's go check out


00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.660
the requirements here.


00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.860
It's just Django.


00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.020
It has, it's only requirement is Django.


00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:53.860
- Django.


00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.940
- It doesn't use like faker or anything like that.


00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.420
So I'm guessing it's its own thing.


00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.260
- Nice, cool.


00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.600
- Yeah, it's very cool.


00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.520
It's very cool.


00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.360
- Thanks.


00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.100
All right, Brian, you gonna cover this next one for us


00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.320
or what?


00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.720
- Yeah, I'll cover this one.


00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.060
That's one of my goals.


00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.160
(laughing)


00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.680
- Well, good comeback.


00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:22.820
- So Ned Batchelder is the maintainer for coverage.py.


00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.940
Excellent tool and he's a great person


00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.540
to have at the helm there.


00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:32.380
but he says that he's got had requests for,


00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.020
like one of the things you can do with coverage


00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.700
is you can incorporate it in your testing tool chain


00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.740
and CI and stuff to say that coverage has to be


00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.560
at a certain level.


00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.180
So you can say, has to be 100% if you wanna do that,


00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.980
or you can say, well, at least what is the current percentage


00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.580
and we wanna make sure that we don't drop it.


00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.780
So you like, let's say you're at 75,


00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.540
you wanna make sure that we don't drop below 75.


00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.560
but he's had requests for per file thresholds,


00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.180
which is an interesting idea.


00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.800
But instead of giving us per file thresholds,


00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.100
he's got like this proof of concept thing


00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.680
called goals.py.


00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.240
And it's just a snippet that you can download yourself


00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.720
and try it out.


00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.200
But it's a little tiny script,


00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.600
but it uses the coverage data after the fact.


00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.240
So coverage generates a report


00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.720
and then you can do things on it.


00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.280
But what this goals thing does


00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.020
is it kind of acts like another stage.


00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.420
So you can set up these in your pipeline


00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.100
to check for these and it'll have a exit code


00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.980
that indicates to your CI system that it failed.


00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.660
But for instance, you can say all of the,


00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.660
I want all my tests to be 100% covered,


00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.180
but my source code, maybe 85% for those.


00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.100
And, but like maybe the HTML part of it,


00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:49.940
I wanna really want,


00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.200
or like all the code that is dealing with HTML,


00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.000
that I wanna make sure that it's really tested.


00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.800
So I want 100% coverage there, but in general, 90%.


00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.800
So he has an example set up to do just what I said of that.


00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.720
So there's these glob groups that you can say,


00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.800
you know, the 85% for everything that's a Python file


00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.800
except for the tests


00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.440
and then have a different test.


00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.600
- So the way you basically do it as a CLI thing


00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.800
and then you pass in file patterns


00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:26.480
like star.py or star HTML, star.py or whatever, right?


00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.760
And you can even do knots, which is interesting.


00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.120
- Yeah, and one of the things he's talking about


00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.040
is just he wants to have people try this and say,


00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.320
is this kind of, does this satisfy what you wanted


00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.160
or is there something else that's needed?


00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.080
Do we really need per file?


00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.320
I actually would hate to have per file 'cause of it.


00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.080
- Yeah, well, yeah.


00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.440
One quick way to like accomplish per file


00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.640
is just to put the file name as the pattern.


00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.320
- Right, I mean, so like this is a super set


00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.320
of per file testing potentially.


00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.480
- But I believe that he's probably right that there's,


00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.680
and there's a link in here to say,


00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.000
if you wanna comment on this,


00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.700
go to the original feature request and do a comment.


00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.920
But there, he's probably right that like,


00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.360
it's not really a per file thing.


00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.200
It's that there's different sections of the system


00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.920
that you want to have specifics.


00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.880
Or like, for instance, with the not, you could say,


00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.940
well, everything except for there's this one file


00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.240
that I know it's a problem, but we don't care about it.


00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.840
Maybe exclude that.


00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.760
- The developer who wrote it quit.


00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.720
Nobody understands it.


00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.560
We're not touching it.


00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.840
Please don't complain to us about it.


00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.180
We have no intention of touching it.


00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.040
- Or maybe it's the splash screen.


00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.880
Like, you know, some things throw up a splash image


00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.040
and you know, really, if that's wrong, who cares?


00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.000
Sort of thing, but.


00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.080
- That's very cool.


00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.100
- Yeah, it's a good one.


00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.520
Nice find.


00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.080
And I like the generalization of it.


00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.400
Well done, Ned.


00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.480
- Yeah.


00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.320
- All right.


00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.080
Morley, so there's a lot of stuff


00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.000
about economic news these days,


00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
especially DeFi and Ethereum and Bitcoin.


00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.040
- And NFTs, right?


00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.600
So it's already out there.


00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.440
- Yeah.


00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.680
My brother is an artist and worked for a long time


00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.160
doing just like insurance stuff


00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.340
and project management stuff.


00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.000
And has now started getting into NFT stuff


00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.400
because he finally put in his master's degree in art to use,


00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.240
which is fantastic.


00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.080
I'm happy for him.


00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.440
It's a crazy world.


00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.580
- It's a crazy world.


00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:27.580
And just the thought about like making digital assets-


00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.280
- Digital scarcity, right?


00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.600
Like the scarcity of digital was you could copy it.


00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.960
- Right, right, right, right.


00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.760
And over the past, I mean, I've been looking at this


00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.800
over the past six months or so, and I'm just curious,


00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.320
where does this go in terms of like,


00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.320
How can you use digital assets as scarcity,


00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.440
but provide value eventually?


00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.760
So artists can actually get paid


00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.200
and or make use of their art,


00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.440
make it available out there and get value from it.


00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.360
So Ethereum though is like one of those blockchains


00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.920
that pretty much I think about,


00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.600
I wanna say 80 to 90% of all NFTs


00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.440
reside on Ethereum blockchain.


00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.440
- I think so, yeah.


00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.560
- Yeah. - It's popular.


00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:18.480
Yeah, and so of course the language there is Solidity, but to interface with the blockchain,


00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.000
there's this library called web3.py, right?


00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:31.160
So instead of using JavaScript, now you can use web3.py to actually interface with Ethereum


00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160
blockchain.


00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:37.080
So basically, you can write smart contracts there, but you can also get information from


00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.160
the blockchain, it's a post information into the blockchain.


00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.040
So this is something I've found and I'm actually looking into it and I thought I'd want to


00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.520
share that with the community.


00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.120
Yeah, it's interesting.


00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.640
So there's ethereum.org/python for Python tutorials.


00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.640
There's a quick start.


00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.640
Right.


00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.640
And so on, yeah.


00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:00.040
Right, if you were alone, you can see what it takes to actually get it installed and


00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.440
use it for some of the protocols that are required.


00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.360
So it's actually pretty good.


00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.980
I've used it just a couple of times and I'm still playing around with it.


00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.580
I think it's instead of using something else, if you're familiar with Python, this is a


00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.660
very comfortable transition if you're curious about blockchain or Ethereum.


00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:23.500
So yeah, so you could build your own platforms and your own integrations, not just own Ethereum


00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.500
coins, right?


00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.580
And so you can be the only smart contract, right?


00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:33.140
We should just logic essentially, send ether or CB ether or or if it's NFTs, again, how


00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.380
do you interface with the blockchain with cryptography?


00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:42.380
So, web3.py, I think is extremely helpful.


00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.060
- Cool.


00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.020
- Yeah.


00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.820
- Yeah, it's neat to see Python applied


00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.400
in so many different places.


00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.620
- Yeah. - Everywhere.


00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.460
- Everywhere, right?


00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.300
- Yeah, everywhere.


00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.620
(both laughing)


00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.460
- Yeah.


00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.900
- Cool.


00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.740
All right, awesome.


00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.900
Yeah, that's a great find.


00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.260
- Pretty cool.


00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.100
- Yeah, pretty cool.


00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.100
Brian, it's time for extras.


00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:04.940
- Extra, extra.


00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.760
- What do you got for us?


00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.780
What do you line up for us here?


00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.240
- I actually don't have any extras today.


00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.880
- No extra, there's no extra, extra, extra


00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.840
read all about it?


00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.680
- No.


00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.160
- All right, I'll take care of it.


00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.760
I got you covered here, as you might imagine.


00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.800
So I wanna give people an update on McFly.


00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.120
I mentioned McFly a little while ago.


00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.520
McFly is sweet.


00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.320
It's allows you to install it


00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.680
and it's kind of like reverse search of your shell commands,


00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.720
be that bash, zshell, phish, whatever.


00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.440
but way better, right?


00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.940
You get like an Emacs interface to your history


00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.840
and you can delete it, you can edit your history.


00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.500
So if you mistype something and you wanna save it


00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.840
or you see like, oh geez, we'll put the password in there.


00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.460
I wanna get that out of my history file, you can do that.


00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.120
So you just hit Control + R after you install it


00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.300
and it gives you this awesome interactive view.


00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.200
I just wanted to tell people


00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.440
that I've been playing with this and totally loving it.


00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.880
Like now I've taken it for a spin for a while


00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.240
and I really, really dig it.


00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.460
I've even set up the fuzzy matching


00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.060
so it doesn't have to exactly match


00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.300
what I've done in history, which is pretty cool.


00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.160
So I can now with some experience, give that a thumbs up.


00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.000
- Nice.


00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.740
- Yeah. - Nice, nice, nice.


00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.300
- Also a couple of exciting things


00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.660
about Python web conference.


00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.540
If you're looking to speak somewhere


00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.380
and you want that somewhere to be on the internet,


00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.180
you should check out Python web conf.


00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.740
This is like a five day conference.


00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:30.660
It's one of the biggest virtual conferences


00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.100
going these days, I think.


00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.260
and it's interactive presentations


00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.460
or live presentations over the internet


00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.540
and then chat and so on.


00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.540
So we've had Calvin, one of the organizers of it on before


00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:49.700
and the news is they've extended their call for papers


00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.020
out into November 15th.


00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.340
So you got 12 more days, maybe 11


00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.060
if I'm slow releasing this one.


00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:00.220
And also I'm gonna be talking about Flask and HTMX


00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.840
over there 'cause I'm still psyched about that.


00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.040
So that's next year, early next year,


00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.400
but people can check that out.


00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.400
- Nice. - All right.


00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.880
What else have I got for us, Brian?


00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.360
So the new MacBook Pros,


00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.760
like the super expensive MacBook Pros have come out.


00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.840
There's an interesting review.


00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.400
I'm not super thrilled with it,


00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.260
but over at ours, they usually do a pretty good job,


00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.120
but I do wanna read a fun quote from it.


00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.080
And they say, "Rest assured,


00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.660
if you didn't like the direction that Apple


00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.480
has been taking with the MacBook Pro


00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.320
for the last five years,


00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.640
this laptop feels like an explicit apology


00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.760
for all that, the result is it's the best laptop money


00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.760
can buy for many use cases, provided you have a lot of money.


00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.480
(both laughing)


00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.340
But one of the things that I found pretty interesting


00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.040
is the power supply for that thing is 140 watts.


00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:45.880
- Oh, wow.


00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.320
- That's insane for a laptop


00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.440
that you carry around the power supply.


00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.440
So I came across this thing called Anker Nano 2, 65 watt.


00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.760
And it's, if you put it up next to...


00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.400
- That's not enough.


00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.240
- It's well, hold on, it's barely bigger than the brick


00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.200
that you use to charge an iPhone.


00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.920
Like an American brick, not a UK brick,


00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.880
which has got to be giant because the size of the plug.


00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.080
But it's like super small and light.


00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.500
And yeah, it seems like it's not enough,


00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.880
but with my, I got a MacBook Pro Max,


00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.160
and I've been using it and this 65 watt thing


00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.000
will charge it just fine.


00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.880
Unless you're doing like machine learning


00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.200
or video exporting or something that completely nails it,


00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.360
like this will charge like 25% in an hour.


00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.180
even though it's supposed to take 140 watts,


00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.360
you can give it this little tiny thing.


00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.760
So I haven't done enough to really give it a hundred percent


00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.680
like absolutely this is gonna work all the time,


00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.680
but my new plan is to travel with this tiny little thing


00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.120
and like a long USB-C or Thunderbolt cable.


00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.360
Interesting, right?


00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.040
- That's pretty interesting.


00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:48.880
- Yeah.


00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.240
- Could you put two in there?


00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.980
- I don't think, maybe it'll catch fire if you do that.


00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.800
I'm not gonna do that.


00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.880
But like here you have the picture,


00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.560
like it's like less than half the size of the charger,


00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.080
which is pretty interesting.


00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.080
That's a 60 watt charger right there,


00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.800
not the 140 watt charger.


00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.640
All right, and finally, I wanna say


00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.300
that if people who have an M1, not an M1 Max or Pro,


00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.120
you can pretty much not have FOMO about this thing.


00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.000
Like as far as I can tell, my Mac mini


00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.860
and my much more expensive MacBook Pro


00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.080
are exactly the same speed.


00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.920
- Oh really?


00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.320
- Like almost always, except one thing I found


00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:33.480
for outputting video, I found that I could re-encode or I could encode the videos for


00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.680
TalkBytes on Training more efficiently.


00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:44.360
I re-encoded the entire library, which is like 220, 230 hours in multiple formats.


00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.040
It took 14 days of compute time.


00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:53.320
Not I got around to doing it in 14 days, like start, it finished 14 days later.


00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.320
And it's actually over three times faster with the M1 Max.


00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.060
So.


00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.740
- So just like three or four days.


00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.300
- Yeah, it's only five days, which is still a long time,


00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.780
but it's way better than 13, 14 days.


00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.940
- 13, 14 days.


00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.140
- Yeah, so I think also this will have


00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.300
a really interesting knock on effect for ML.


00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.140
More than ML.


00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:18.300
It's got like the onboard machine learning block


00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.780
and it's got a 32 core GPU.


00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.700
I think there's a lot of stuff that's gonna be coming along


00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:22.600
that's pretty interesting there.


00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.440
What do you think?


00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.180
- No, no, no, you're absolutely right.


00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.260
I have a friend that works for Google,


00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.760
does the same thing that I do,


00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.680
and him and I were talking.


00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.680
I have just the little version of MacBook Pro,


00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.240
and I wasn't gonna wait for another one to come out,


00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.600
but it has a lot of the components


00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.680
and a lot of capacity that I need to do my work.


00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.320
So instead of just putting your stuff on AWS,


00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.160
now you can run them locally,


00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.520
and it's extremely powerful.


00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.520
So this is extremely good, especially the M1 core.


00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.280
- The new stuff is quite neat.


00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.720
It's seriously impressive.


00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.280
As Sam had said out there, I totally agree.


00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.160
- Very impressive.


00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.000
- Yeah.


00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.120
Morley, anything else you want to throw out for people


00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.600
while you got the mic?


00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.680
- No, I just want to say thanks to you and Brian, right?


00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.040
So again, I've been listening to you guys


00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.720
for a very long time and I've come this far


00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.720
partly because I've been listening to you guys.


00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.640
It's the encouragement.


00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.200
I think you guys, every day,


00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.040
every time I listen to you guys,


00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.400
you guys are talking to me


00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.840
not to a large group of audience.


00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.520
I think it's extremely helpful to see you guys be part of the community.


00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.560
And shout out to Pi Bay in San Francisco.


00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.680
Those guys are real cool.


00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.600
And Michael, thanks for coming out there and talking to us.


00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.160
- That was a great trip a few weeks ago.


00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.600
- That was a few weeks ago, so it was real good.


00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:41.240
So I want to thank you guys for the work that you guys do, and we'll continue to


00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.240
listen to you guys and be part of the community.


00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.840
- Yeah, thanks.


00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.800
Yeah, I really appreciate that.


00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.120
Thank you.


00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.880
It's a lot of times we put stuff out there


00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.400
and there's not a lot of feedback,


00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.680
but you know people are out there listening.


00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.240
Then you meet folks and talk to them,


00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.700
you're like actually, it has an impact,


00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.160
which is really great.


00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.480
- No, for me it has a particular impact, right?


00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.880
So like I took a journey in that it's,


00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.920
I am where I'm at today because again,


00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.960
partly because of the work that you guys do.


00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.880
I'm listening to you guys doing a lot of the research


00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.380
and following up on a lot of the topics


00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.520
that you guys have on the show.


00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.520
So it's taken me a long way


00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.440
because I listen to you guys a lot.


00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.560
- Yeah, thank you so much.


00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.400
- Yes.


00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.400
- Yeah.


00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.240
- All right, Brian, we're ready for a joke.


00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.360
Finish it up with a smile.


00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.000
- Well, I just wanted to comment that maybe


00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.640
the next version of MacBook Pro,


00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.160
you might have to charge it in the laundry room


00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.360
because that's the only one with a plug.


00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.440
(laughing)


00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.000
- Yeah, if it gets a 240 volt, yeah, that's right.


00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
(laughing)


00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.840
- Yeah.


00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.400
- But the thing is, it almost never runs at that, right?


00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.160
It'll go for like 14, 15 hours.


00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.040
It's only if you're doing like insane stuff.


00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.380
And also you can plug in three Thunderbolt USB, three things.


00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.560
And each one of those, it'll provide up to 15 Watts of output from the laptop.


00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.500
Oh, wow.


00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.340
So I think it's also trying to pass.


00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:57.800
Yeah.


00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.380
I think it's trying to pass through 45 Watts.


00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.720
So it needs a charger that can account for how much does the


00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.680
Mac need plus 45 more Watts.


00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.200
Right.


00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.280
Cause you plugged it into all these Thunderbolt thingies.


00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.280
Anyway, I've been trying to think about why it really is someone that's so high.


00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:19.040
Chris May is going to hook us up to a level three DC fast charger.


00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.040
Charge that thing up in five minutes on the car.


00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.040
[LAUGHTER]


00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:23.760
All right.


00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:29.440
So this one comes to us from the variable xkcd.


00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.920
And it talks to us about programming standards.


00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.280
So how standards proliferate.


00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.400
See, AC chargers-- very timely--


00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.780
character encodings, instant messaging, and so on.


00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.120
I'm thinking network protocols.


00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.280
Remember, this is a follow on from the joke of,


00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.240
what is soap?


00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.080
(laughs)


00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.520
And then rest, what the heck was wrong with soap?


00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.020
I know GPRC is better than rest.


00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.360
Ah, the torture never ends.


00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.600
Okay, so this is a follow up from that.


00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:04.600
And here is a man and woman developer sitting here talking.


00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.600
Says, situation, there are 14 competing standards.


00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.580
14, ridiculous.


00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.940
We need to develop one universal standard


00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.540
that covers everyone's use cases.


00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.420
Yeah, soon.


00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.720
Situation, there are 15 competing standards.


00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.960
(laughing)


00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.300
- Yep.


00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.140
- Yep. - Yeah.


00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.820
The only thing going in the other direction


00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.940
is cellular standards.


00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.660
They seem to be lessening. - Oh, really?


00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:32.140
- So, but wifi is going crazy.


00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.980
But anyway, it's just one standard,


00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.980
but it comes out with a new version about every six months.


00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:40.460
- Good thing they don't bake those into a hardware


00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:41.420
and chips and stuff.


00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.260
Oh wait.


00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.140
(laughing)


00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.100
- That's a good thing they do.


00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.460
I'd be out of business if they didn't.


00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.300
- Exactly.


00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.940
Gotta, the testing never ends.


00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:49.780
Fantastic.


00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.540
- Yeah.


00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.360
Thanks Michael.


00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.200
Thanks Morley.


00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.900
This was a really fun episode.


00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.740
- Yep.


00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.560
Thank you very much.


00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.400
Thanks for the invite.


00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.220
Appreciate it.


00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.580
- It takes everybody on the chat


00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.620
and on the stream for watching.


00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.980
- Yep.


00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:04.820
Bye all.


00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.660
- Bye.


00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.480
- Bye.
