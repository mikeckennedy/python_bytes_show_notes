00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Sure. It's the first show of 2026.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>directly to your earbuds.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>This is episode 464,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>recorded January 5th,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>2026.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Brian, it's 2026.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 2>It is amazing.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>That's Brian Okken.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 1>And we're here to bring you

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.980
<v Speaker 1>another year of awesome Python news.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>And we've got a bunch of good ones

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>queued up here.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I've got a pretty interesting spy story

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>to tell people, Brian.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be very fun.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.239
<v Speaker 1>If you're listening and you're not subscribed to the newsletter, you definitely should.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>It's super high quality.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.500
<v Speaker 1>We put a lot of extra details, extra information, not just an emailing version of the show notes.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Follow us on the socials.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>You'll find them probably in the newsletter.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I believe they're right there at the top, but also in the show notes.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>And yeah, with that, Brian, how would you like to kick things off for the new year?

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Let's kick it off with a new tool.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.320
<v Speaker 2>So switch to, what are we doing?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's go with this view.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Anyway, Ty, I think I'm pronouncing it Ty.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it's supposed to be.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>I've asked Charlie Marsh, it's Ty.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>No, wait.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>No, it's T-Y.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>T-Y.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>It's T-Y.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I believe because it's uv, T-Y.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm starting to doubt myself.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>But when I interviewed him about T-Y, I asked, I'm pretty sure it's T-Y.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh, that makes sense.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>uv and ty okay ty uh okay um it's an extreme it says it is an extremely fast python type checker

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 2>and lsp which is what a language server protocol like i don't know what lsp stands for do you

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.980
<v Speaker 1>language server protocol uh yeah lsp something yep anyway um it's okay so ty's been out for a while

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 2>But the news as of December 16th is that it's in beta.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.780
<v Speaker 2>People have been playing with it for a while anyway.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 2>But I thought, so we're going to link to the Charlie Marshall's announcement of it.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.680
<v Speaker 2>But, and this was going to actually, to be clear, this was going to be an extra.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 2>But I was playing with it this weekend and I'm kind of in love.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I really like ty.

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 2>really fast type checker and language server.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.280
<v Speaker 2>And luckily, this is not one where it's so fast that you say,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 2>did it actually run?

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Because it actually prints something out.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>When you run like tie check, it'll say, yeah.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Even if it doesn't find anything, it says like all done or everything.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Speaker 2>So thank you.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Thank you to you, Astral, to actually letting us know that it's finished.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 2>But it is super fast.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.120
<v Speaker 2>So type checking, I've used mypy before.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that's pronounced mypy.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 2>And PyRite, I tried that, and PyLance.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 2>So actually, I don't remember.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 2>PyLance has been a while, but I have tried PyRite and mypy

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 2>because people have submitted issues with some of my projects to say,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.440
<v Speaker 2>hey, these throw problems with mypy.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Can we fix this?

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.180
<v Speaker 2>So we've had some fixes on like pytestCheck has been one project that we've made some changes.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.020
<v Speaker 2>However, okay, so installed ty just the other day.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 2>And yes, it is super fast.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't, I'm using, expecting, they have a graph that shows, oh, what are they typing?

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh, they checked home assistant project.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:24.440
<v Speaker 2>which is a pretty big project and um my pie takes 45 seconds to run and ty takes two seconds and uh

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 2>i didn't have anything that large it just ran instantly and spit out a ton of stuff so i tried

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.159
<v Speaker 2>actually went back and tried a couple other projects um so here's another project uh

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 2>running it let's see in the torch project oh oh recompute i'm getting ahead of myself

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.680
<v Speaker 2>so it's really fast but that's not the coolest part the coolest part is it's really fast just

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 2>the first time and then it's even faster when you run it again because uh they're doing um

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.319
<v Speaker 2>they're doing regenerative stuff so when you um after what did they write down um it's designed

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 2>from the ground up to be incremental, to have incrementality. I don't think that's a word,

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 2>guys, but to incrementally just check the things you changed to make it faster. And the reason why

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:28.219
<v Speaker 2>is to try to get it running within your editor as well. So yeah, so it's pretty fun. I actually

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.880
<v Speaker 2>ran it so like i said i ran it on some small projects and it um a couple things i'm like why

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:41.520
<v Speaker 2>is it bugging me about this but i just tried to fix the suggestions and i found that actually it

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.820
<v Speaker 2>was making easier to read code even though i didn't some of the things i didn't quite get

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.139
<v Speaker 2>like here's one that tripped me up so if you uh if you declare if you've got a function with uh

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 2>input parameter and you declare the input type. I always think of that as like the input type I

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 2>expect the user to call this function with. But once I'm in the function, I can change the type.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 2>If it came in as a list of strings and I wanted to turn it into just a concatenated full string,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 2>that was actually the example I had. And it said, yeah, that's the wrong type. You said list of

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.980
<v Speaker 2>strings, but then you assigned it a string. And I'm like, well, okay, could I, if it, would it be

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>more clear if I add a new variable and I actually just tried to clean it up and I'm like, yeah,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.740
<v Speaker 2>this is easier to read actually. It'll be better to maintain. So I'm trying to embrace the error

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.860
<v Speaker 2>messages as something that might make it easier to read even and not become combative. But I tried

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 2>installing, there's an extension that they released also to the ty extension for VS Code.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.620
<v Speaker 2>And this does a ton of stuff.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Inlay type hints, go to definition information.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm pointing this out because I know people will try it out.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:04.140
<v Speaker 2>But be sure to read the documentation because there's a warning in there to say it's a language server also.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 2>So you need to either turn off the default language server or turn off TY's language server.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Having two at the same time don't work great.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.680
<v Speaker 2>So I'm super happy with the project so far.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I definitely want to give the extension a try.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I've been using PyRite as well.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's also, sorry, PowerFly.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 1>All the pies.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.240
<v Speaker 1>PowerFly.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.880
<v Speaker 1>And it has the same deal.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go disable a bunch of stuff in the Visual Studio editors.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.120
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, like Cursor and others.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's annoying that you've got to do it.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that is a fault of Visual Studio code.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Why would it let you run two language servers for the same language?

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 1>That should be like, which one do you want to use?

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Just tell me, right?

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I detected that two are running.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.360
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of the nature of Visual Studio being just composed

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 1>out of a bunch of disjointed things, right?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 1>But once you get it set up, it's super nice.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.079
<v Speaker 2>One thing I wanted to bring up that I haven't yet also is

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.500
<v Speaker 2>when I ran it on pytestCheck,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.700
<v Speaker 2>it ran, it like,

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.160
<v Speaker 2>and actually I've known that the pytestCheck

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 2>is kind of a fun plugin, but it

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 2>has some, like,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm hacking Python with this. I'm like

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.540
<v Speaker 2>overloading a bunch of stuff

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 2>and a package that's also

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.320
<v Speaker 2>a context manager

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I do plan on, like,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.419
<v Speaker 2>it's noting a whole bunch of errors, and I do

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:34.360
<v Speaker 2>want to fix all those that just have a lot of other

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:35.099
<v Speaker 2>stuff going on.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm not like a really, I didn't intend for this to be an apology.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.880
<v Speaker 2>What I'm meaning is when I go to check these, ty has a whole bunch of settings.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.360
<v Speaker 2>You can turn off any check.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.000
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I think I'll do.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably like any of them that are failing, I'll probably turn them off and then fix them one at a time and go through.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.740
<v Speaker 2>And I like that they just said, you know what?

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.860
<v Speaker 2>People might want to turn any of these off.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.680
<v Speaker 2>So we'll just give you access to all of them.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, that's very cool.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to throw out one more thing about the fast.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Like, well, my editor is fast enough.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Or what's it matter if it takes 20 seconds for PyRite to run?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.100
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that you can do with these

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that I don't think a lot of people are doing,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 1>but you can tell, you can set up rules

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.760
<v Speaker 1>and tell your agentic coding tools,

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.600
<v Speaker 1>like whenever you make a change,

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.760
<v Speaker 1>please run ty or PyRly or whatever against my code base

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.740
<v Speaker 1>and verify that you haven't made any typing mistakes.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Everything's hanging together, right?

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.820
<v Speaker 1>And those tools will do that like over and over,

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.480
<v Speaker 1>and it can just make it super slow, right?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.760
<v Speaker 1>So if you're not sitting there waiting for the thing to run and run,

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 1>you know, just reanalyze, reanalyze,

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.460
<v Speaker 1>just tell it to use ty and it'll just be nearly instant.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Nope, it's fine.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I got to fix something, right?

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.240
<v Speaker 1>So one more use case here.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, and like we said, since it's incremental,

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 2>it'll be like milliseconds to rerun it.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, exactly.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Super cool.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.500
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I have a scary story for you, Brian.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.240
<v Speaker 1>So I want to talk about a pair of articles I wrote,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.020
<v Speaker 1>and I think they're very constructive,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 1>very helpful for people to use.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.860
<v Speaker 1>So increasingly in open source,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:39.560
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with issues around supply chain problems, right?

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.880
<v Speaker 1>This first surfaced most prominently with typosquatting,

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure people have heard of that word by now,

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's like Django without the J or whatever.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 1>And if people don't really know and they type, you know,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 1>pip install dango or whatever,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 1>it might go and find nothing.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.500
<v Speaker 1>and say that's there, or it might find something that someone put up there to look like Django,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.960
<v Speaker 1>but also bring down some kind of malicious badness, right? And that's a problem. You can fix it by

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:20.640
<v Speaker 1>being careful. The PyPI folks are doing a lot of work to fight that and to like preserve misspellings

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.040
<v Speaker 1>of common, common things, but it's still, it's an issue, right? I mean, it's gone so far that

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:32.420
<v Speaker 1>There are people trying to see what agent encoding LLMs would recommend

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.420
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes they would make up package names

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.680
<v Speaker 1>and then they would go put stuff there.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.980
<v Speaker 1>So the next time it recommends that non-existing thing,

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.300
<v Speaker 1>it actually exists as a virus.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to be careful.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.120
<v Speaker 1>But way more serious than that is there were some announcements

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.459
<v Speaker 1>that some folks had been phished who worked on some project

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.700
<v Speaker 1>and their PyPI credentials were hacked

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.800
<v Speaker 1>and their projects were replaced with lookalike projects,

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.320
<v Speaker 1>but that also had bad things in it, right?

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's way worse.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.120
<v Speaker 1>So if I use some library, and it uses a library,

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.960
<v Speaker 1>which itself uses a less-known library way down the chain,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and that third level gets hacked,

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:20.280
<v Speaker 1>and I pip install the new version of my library, I'm toast, right?

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's not because I misspelled something.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 1>nobody misspelled anything. It's because somewhere along the way, somebody's computer got taken over

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:34.620
<v Speaker 1>in some way. Off it goes. This is bad. So I thought I was thinking about this over winter break. I'm

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.960
<v Speaker 1>like, well, what can we do about it? So I wrote two articles with concrete advice. First one,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Python supply chain made easy. Right? And what are you going to do? I gave out some examples.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:54.060
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing. We have this tool called PipAudit. PipAudit is cool. It audits Python

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>environments. It's officially part of the PyPA. It's under their GitHub organization, even though

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 1>it's Trellabits and Google have also had influence on it. It audits Python environments, requirement

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 1>files, and dependency trees for known security vulnerabilities, and it can even fix them. I don't

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.079
<v Speaker 1>care about fixing them because it may be too late. I just want that to not happen. So what I was

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 1>thinking is like, well, how do we use that tool?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.240
<v Speaker 1>And how do we use UV?

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.360
<v Speaker 1>So one thing you can do is with pipaudit

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.440
<v Speaker 1>is you can just say this virtual environment,

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.680
<v Speaker 1>everything installed in here, how's it looking?

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Is it bad or is it not bad, right?

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>And you can just uv tool install it

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.840
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't have to be installed

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.720
<v Speaker 1>in your local environment, not necessarily, right?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.100
<v Speaker 1>You just have that active when you run it.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:39.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.080
<v Speaker 1>But what if people don't run it?

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.160
<v Speaker 1>You know, like this is always the problem is like,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I set up this thing, this way to lint code or format it

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.380
<v Speaker 1>to make sure we always do it right.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.960
<v Speaker 1>But then there's those people that just don't run it, right?

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.360
<v Speaker 1>So one thing you can do this nice is I created a unit test,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.280
<v Speaker 1>pytest test, which will run pip audit

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.600
<v Speaker 1>on wherever pytest is running.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.840
<v Speaker 1>So like your application that's being tested,

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.240
<v Speaker 1>it will also run pipaudit against that.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:16.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's cool.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.000
<v Speaker 1>It just does a sub process,

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.240
<v Speaker 1>figures out which version of Python it is,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.780
<v Speaker 1>and then it just runs pipaudit.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.280
<v Speaker 1>For this to work,

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.020
<v Speaker 1>you've got to actually have it installed

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.580
<v Speaker 1>as part of the virtual environment,

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.700
<v Speaker 1>but that's all good, right?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:33.020
<v Speaker 1>So then it will just look at all the stuff you've got installed,

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.080
<v Speaker 1>and your tests will fail,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.480
<v Speaker 1>which means your CI will fail

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.640
<v Speaker 1>if some kind of vulnerable thing gets in there.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:39.960
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah pretty nice so people can just grab this test and drop it in and there's

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:51.440
<v Speaker 1>really not much to it and you run it it's cool also you could I mean you could

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.340
<v Speaker 1>set it up as a git commit hook but it's a little bit slow so next thing you can

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:01.860
<v Speaker 1>do is very often something like this will happen a couple days later people

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:08.679
<v Speaker 1>are like why is my CPU at 100% and why is it this project I'm working on you

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.740
<v Speaker 1>know that it'll get discovered right and these things get yanked pretty quickly

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.020
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of the positive side is they don't typically last so the other thing

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:25.280
<v Speaker 1>you can do was with uv as you can say uv pip compile or or uv sink - - upgrade I

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:31.980
<v Speaker 1>think is the command for the uv lock file version but regardless you can

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:38.820
<v Speaker 1>always pass a exclude newer than just dash, dash, exclude, dash newer some timeframe.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:44.800
<v Speaker 1>So I chose one week. And what that means is if when I say update my requirements in the pinned

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:53.320
<v Speaker 1>lock file, it will basically pretend anything released in the last week doesn't exist and only

00:15:53.420 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 1>update them to a week ago. That way, because the problem is pip audit can know that there's a bad

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:08.260
<v Speaker 1>one, but if it was released 10 minutes ago, pip audit, no one's going to have reported it and

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.600
<v Speaker 1>formalized it, right? There's this window in the really early days of a package being updated that

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.319
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to catch it and get it into the ecosystem in time, right? And so just having a

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:26.060
<v Speaker 1>little bit of time like let let other people try this project for a week if if no one freaks out

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:33.120
<v Speaker 1>and says oh my gosh it's taking over the world it's more likely to be okay right yeah sure i mean

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.040
<v Speaker 1>look it's not a complete defense it's not like well if it's a week or older it's never going to

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:43.520
<v Speaker 1>be a problem but almost all of these that are big problems are discovered within a week or you know

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:48.139
<v Speaker 1>put a month whatever you put a year like whatever you feel is like enough that it's very unlikely

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.740
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get tied up in it, right?

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.280
<v Speaker 1>We can put whatever number you want.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.740
<v Speaker 1>But the point is you can put a delay.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.340
<v Speaker 1>So whenever you say update my dependencies,

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.780
<v Speaker 1>it says, but not the very, very, very new ones.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 1>And I've been doing that for a while

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's been fine.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.780
<v Speaker 1>For a while, I mean like a week and a half.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:05.880
<v Speaker 1>But I thought, okay, well, what about,

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.640
<v Speaker 1>this is all well and good if you have CI,

00:17:08.939 --> 00:17:10.260
<v Speaker 1>but what about production?

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.800
<v Speaker 1>What if you're doing like DevOps with Docker or stuff?

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.959
<v Speaker 1>Also, if you run your pip audit

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:24.300
<v Speaker 1>and it tells you that you have a virus you've pip installed into your dev machine too late

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.660
<v Speaker 1>once you've installed a virus like it could have downloaded stuff off the internet it could put

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:36.440
<v Speaker 1>rootkits like you're done right that machine probably needs formatted it's very bad so is

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.000
<v Speaker 1>there a way that we could do this before we put it into our computer with pip audit right

00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:49.260
<v Speaker 1>you can under some circumstances give it like a requirements file but I think a better way is to

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:55.480
<v Speaker 1>just install stuff into a virtual environment so I did a follow-up thing here that says here's how

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you create a docker instance that can copy whatever lock file you have into your temporary docker

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:13.300
<v Speaker 1>container, install the requirements with uv, run pip audit on it, and then give you an answer back.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:21.680
<v Speaker 1>That way, even if it does find something, it finds them over there. Not in your computer,

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:26.400
<v Speaker 1>but in an isolated Docker environment, which should be safe. So it talks to you that,

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.640
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty cool. I'll give you a little Docker file that works nice and easy. You can

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.120
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you want, create an alias so that it will run with nice reporting. You can skip things

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:43.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't care about. Like this PDF library on Windows, if you give it a SVG file, image file,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.920
<v Speaker 1>it has a vulnerability. I'm like, well, one, I'm not running on Windows. I'm not giving it user

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.120
<v Speaker 1>input. Like I don't care about like, I just, that's not a problem to me. Now, there's certain

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:58.880
<v Speaker 1>things you might want to just ignore. And then finally, you can put, I'll show you how to use

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.580
<v Speaker 1>like super good build time caching

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.800
<v Speaker 1>to actually run as part of your Docker build pip audit

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.400
<v Speaker 1>so that you can't even build a container

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.400
<v Speaker 1>that has a vulnerability.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.000
<v Speaker 1>It will fail the Docker build if it has a problem,

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.480
<v Speaker 1>according to pip audit,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.040
<v Speaker 1>for some definition of a problem.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.360
<v Speaker 1>So that whole series I wrote over winter break,

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.580
<v Speaker 1>and I think it'll help people.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Super easy to adopt.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.880
<v Speaker 1>There's not much to it.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.620
<v Speaker 1>If you're using Docker, it's got good things for that.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.220
<v Speaker 1>If you're not, it also has things you can adopt.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious with the, yeah, on this topic,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.360
<v Speaker 2>like of dependencies and stuff and possible vulnerabilities.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to remember the name of the word,

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.060
<v Speaker 2>but basically if you take some other project

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.100
<v Speaker 2>and just copy its source into yours.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Vendoring.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Vendoring, that's it.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm just wondering if that's going to happen more

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:00.440
<v Speaker 2>because more often for production projects

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.540
<v Speaker 2>because you could have something automatically

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.600
<v Speaker 2>or have an agent or something checked

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.280
<v Speaker 2>to see if there's any updates in the project

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.760
<v Speaker 2>and copy them in and test them.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, I think that's going to happen a lot,

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.140
<v Speaker 1>especially for small libraries.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Like, oh, this one just adds color to your output.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.940
<v Speaker 1>You're like, hmm, do I really need it?

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.660
<v Speaker 1>How often is that going to change?

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Probably never.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Do I need to be subjected to a supply chain store?

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.920
<v Speaker 1>or could I just copy it in?

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Or with the agent encoding things,

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.700
<v Speaker 1>you're like, I really just need these two functions.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Can I just ask it to write these functions?

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.360
<v Speaker 1>And if they're working, I don't need a library at all.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100%.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.760
<v Speaker 1>I think so.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to actually talk about main updates as well

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.840
<v Speaker 2>in a different sense, I guess.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.300
<v Speaker 2>So I want to talk about typing extensions.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.500
<v Speaker 2>And again, this comes out of a suggestion from a listener.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:04.200
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be just an extra, but I started using it, and it's pretty cool.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:15.820
<v Speaker 2>So in December, we were talking about, or I was talking about at least, deprecation warnings and the topic of how do you deal with that of deprecated items.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:24.320
<v Speaker 2>And one recommendation was using the deprecated decorator.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:31.700
<v Speaker 2>So you could say warnings import from warnings import deprecated and decorate a deprecated function.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.320
<v Speaker 2>However, we were reminded that that's Python 3.13 only.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Somebody named Pryoinv on Mastodon notified us and said, hey, there's the typing extensions and they have them.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.620
<v Speaker 2>And so I was checking this out.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.540
<v Speaker 2>So the typing extensions, let's see, deprecated.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.120
<v Speaker 2>We could just say, get it from typing extensions.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.560
<v Speaker 2>And now we've got it on earlier versions of Python.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I haven't, like, I don't know if this is a, okay.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I'll save my comments, a couple of comments for the end.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.140
<v Speaker 2>But I'm pretty excited about this.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:21.880
<v Speaker 2>So I'm hoping that I can just use modern typing for different projects.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.580
<v Speaker 2>And why is this important?

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 2>It's important because me as a developer,

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of remember how to do typing in one version of Python.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.760
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm trying to remember,

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:40.360
<v Speaker 2>what typing decorators and all that stuff do I use for 3.12 versus 3.13 versus 3.14?

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's hard to keep track.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.720
<v Speaker 2>So I'm excited to start using typing extensions.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.520
<v Speaker 2>And hopefully this cures the trying to keep track of it all.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole bunch of stuff in here.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:05.700
<v Speaker 2>It's got typing primitives, protocols, decorators, functions, enums, pure aliases, all sorts of stuff.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:10.040
<v Speaker 2>And it tells you when things were added and all that.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.300
<v Speaker 2>So anyway, kind of fun.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:12.640
<v Speaker 2>OK.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, that's very nice.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:20.840
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully I can get away with just using the deprecated wrapper, even in 3.12.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Because, I mean, come on.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got a project that uses the newest, because it's my side project.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.140
<v Speaker 2>It's using the newest version.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Or I've got a library that I'm supporting that's supporting everything back to 3.12, maybe, or 3.8, or 3.9, or whatever.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.780
<v Speaker 2>And then a work project that's using 3.13, stuff like that.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, I got a message from somebody saying,

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.180
<v Speaker 1>what am I open source little smaller libraries?

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.120
<v Speaker 1>They can't get it to work.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 1>They can't get it to install or something.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.280
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like, hmm, can't really see what the problem is.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh, you're using 3.9 and it's using some feature of 3.10

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.160
<v Speaker 1>and it says it needs 3.10.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.240
<v Speaker 1>They're like, why doesn't this work?

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm like, literally, it sounds new,

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.780
<v Speaker 1>but that is no longer supported at all.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.780
<v Speaker 1>It's easy for these to sound like,

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.300
<v Speaker 1>3.9 is not that old,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's out of even the bug fixes and security fixes.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, so people remember to do a min version

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.700
<v Speaker 2>in your PyProject.toml

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.060
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing a library that other people install

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.800
<v Speaker 2>so that it just doesn't even update to that version.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what I did.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.980
<v Speaker 1>But there was not a fallbacks older version

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:37.840
<v Speaker 1>they could use, right?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 1>because it uses types that are not available,

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.320
<v Speaker 1>like the lowercase d dict of string string

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.160
<v Speaker 1>or something like that, right?

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Who wants to go back to importing uppercase dict?

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:54.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I will do it when he needs support.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.280
<v Speaker 1>But if it's literally out of support, I'm sorry.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.560
<v Speaker 1>This is not on me to make my library work on as far back

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:04.240
<v Speaker 1>as history goes.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:04.760
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about my spy story.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.200
<v Speaker 1>So this is a real short one.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.240
<v Speaker 1>My first one was really long.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:12.960
<v Speaker 1>This one's really short.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:19.760
<v Speaker 1>New MI6 chief Blaise Metroeli outlined her vision for a technologically –

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:20.460
<v Speaker 1>technology?

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Augmented intelligence gathering in her first public speech on December 15th,

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.020
<v Speaker 1>warning that the U.K. operates in a space between peace and war.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean, MI6, come on, James Bond, pretty cool.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 1>At the Tameside headquarters, she said previously the UK –

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.660
<v Speaker 1>she was previously in charge of Q, which is kind of cool.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, said the headline is,

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:55.960
<v Speaker 1>we will need our MI6 spies agents to be as fluent in Python as they are in Russian.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of interesting, right?

00:25:59.820 --> 00:25:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Look, we live in this super technological world,

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.320
<v Speaker 1>and so much of this is becoming cyber more and more.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 1>One of the main bits is, while mentioning China,

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Miraweli focused mainly on the threats from Russia.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.340
<v Speaker 1>She said the country is, Russia is,

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.740
<v Speaker 1>testing us in the gray zone with tactics

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.140
<v Speaker 1>that are just below the threshold of war.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much cyber attacks, critical infrastructure,

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.020
<v Speaker 1>drones, propaganda, all the stuff

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.860
<v Speaker 1>that having some kind of programming skill will super help.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.140
<v Speaker 1>So anyway, I just thought this was an interesting headline

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.000
<v Speaker 1>and worth a little shout out.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Also, I didn't know Q was real.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:42.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't either.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I was like, oh, this is so cool.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.880
<v Speaker 2>I knew MI6 was a real thing, but Q, that's awesome.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I know.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely cool.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:51.700
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, everyone needs to know Python these days.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.340
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Jake VanderPless in 2017, the PyCon keynote said,

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Python is a, oh gosh, what term?

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Basically like a quilt of all these different uses,

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 1>use cases of people doing interesting things.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Well, here's one more patch in the quilt.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, even if you got a cooler language,

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.620
<v Speaker 2>we'll just incorporate it into Python.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:19.760
<v Speaker 2>We are the Borg.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.460
<v Speaker 1>There's something to that.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:25.720
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to lean into next here?

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.520
<v Speaker 2>So we're into extras now.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:36.460
<v Speaker 2>So I said that I was going to take some time off from writing in December,

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.440
<v Speaker 2>and I had a wonderful break with my family.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.600
<v Speaker 2>And now I'm back to writing again.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to announce that the next chapter is going to be finding waste in test-driven development.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.940
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know why I was stressed out about it.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.840
<v Speaker 2>But yesterday I just sat down and wrote, I think, a first draft.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I need to clean it up a little bit, but I want to get this released today.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:08.340
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully by the time you listen to this, if you're not watching it live, it'll be around.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.660
<v Speaker 2>And I'll, yeah, so the next one will be there.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:17.320
<v Speaker 2>I've still got a goal of finishing this, at least the first draft, by the end of January.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a tight deadline.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I only have half the chapters written so far, but I think that we can get there.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I think the later chapters are possibly shorter.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.380
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to try to release it as an audiobook too,

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.940
<v Speaker 2>so I can't make them too long or else they'll kill me.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay, so that's going on.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.840
<v Speaker 2>One of the things keeping me updated and on track, hopefully,

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.440
<v Speaker 2>is watches.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 2>So slight change of topic,

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:53.340
<v Speaker 2>but I am back to sporting a non-smart watch.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:29:04.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing what I've got a right now I'm wearing a Victorinox watch and I picked it up at an estate sale for 40 bucks and it was a steal.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:05.440
<v Speaker 2>It was great.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Great watch.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:16.400
<v Speaker 2>But and then since I'm now looking for watches, my I picked up a couple more estate sales in the last last week, too.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.140
<v Speaker 2>So that's fun.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Something getting in the way of writing, though, is a Christmas present I got for my family.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:31.440
<v Speaker 2>So they got me a Steam Deck, and I'm having a blast with it.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.480
<v Speaker 2>I like not having a console.

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I like just sitting on the couch or sitting back in a chair and playing video games.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm having fun with that again.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:45.260
<v Speaker 2>So I'd loved, and I've been looking through the store and everything.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to have anybody let me know.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 2>So let me know on Bluesky or Mastodon

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.200
<v Speaker 2>if there's a particular game I should check out.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been into the gaming scene since the early 90s.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.360
<v Speaker 1>I've got some good recommendations for you.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know for sure that they'll run on the Steam Deck,

00:30:02.539 --> 00:30:07.560
<v Speaker 1>but they do run on Windows Steam in OniForce Now.

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Small lands, S-M-A-L-L-A-N-D-S.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Small lands, you're like a little tiny creature

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.480
<v Speaker 1>running around this forest exploring it,

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.100
<v Speaker 1>and ladybugs come by, and they're like hip height.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a really cool experience.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.840
<v Speaker 1>The graphics is incredible.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.860
<v Speaker 1>The music is peaceful.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Give that one a go.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:29.600
<v Speaker 2>All right.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.180
<v Speaker 2>But anyway, reach out on Master of Bluesky.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Let me know what you were playing.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Michael, do you have any extras?

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I do.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I got actually two follow-ups now that you've mentioned these things.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.720
<v Speaker 1>They were not originally there,

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.260
<v Speaker 1>but I've been dreaming of the Steam Machine,

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.880
<v Speaker 1>which is like a six inch by six inch cube

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.640
<v Speaker 1>that is kind of like a local,

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.560
<v Speaker 1>you put it by your TV or something.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if it makes sense for me to get it,

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.420
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like a really neat machine.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about that.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.060
<v Speaker 1>That just got announced.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:02.480
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.720
<v Speaker 1>But back to watches,

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a Pebble Round 2,

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.740
<v Speaker 1>which is a really cool little round watch

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.640
<v Speaker 1>that had a traditional watch look,

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 1>but it was a smartwatch.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.440
<v Speaker 1>This predates Apple Watch, I think.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.080
<v Speaker 1>And it was so good.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I loved it so much.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.240
<v Speaker 1>It was incredibly thin.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.420
<v Speaker 1>The e-ink display just looked like a real watch face.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.580
<v Speaker 1>And I had so many people come up to me and say,

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.100
<v Speaker 1>wow, that is a cool watch.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.460
<v Speaker 1>What kind of watch is that?

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.580
<v Speaker 1>And these would be like older people

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.060
<v Speaker 1>or people that were not techie,

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.560
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't realize even that it was a smartwatch.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 1>They were just, man, that's cool.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.640
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like, actually, that's a smartwatch.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.280
<v Speaker 1>They're like, what is it?

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh, my gosh.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Why am I saying this?

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:47.620
<v Speaker 1>It's coming back.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.740
<v Speaker 1>They're remaking it.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Pebble's coming back and is open source.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.900
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're a fan of Pebble,

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of Pebble things coming back.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.820
<v Speaker 1>So yay for watches.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm still sticking with my Apple Watch

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.740
<v Speaker 1>because I love all the health analytics

00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.700
<v Speaker 1>it gathers about me.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.980
<v Speaker 1>All right, here's my actual extras.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Better not follow up, impromptu follow-ups.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So Ruben Lerner just posted a 12 video series

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.640
<v Speaker 1>on what's coming up in Pandas 3.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.260
<v Speaker 1>so getting ready for pandas 3 short focused video series so like I said 12

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.980
<v Speaker 1>videos come check it out if you're looking forward to what's coming up in

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:27.620
<v Speaker 1>pandas and I just released as in two hours ago a really awesome talk Python

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:32.300
<v Speaker 1>episode called web frameworks in production by their creators so I have

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 1>folks from the Django team folks from the Litestar team from flask and court

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.799
<v Speaker 1>and FastAPI all of the people who create all of those coming on to talk

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.640
<v Speaker 1>about how you should run their web framework in production.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was just super, super fun, cool conversation.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh, wow.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Looking forward to watching that.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Somebody in the audience said that I basically put the Python Avengers team together when

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.420
<v Speaker 1>it comes to web frameworks.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It was really incredible.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Quite the crew there.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.400
<v Speaker 1>That's it for my extras.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.780
<v Speaker 1>How are you feeling about a joke?

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh, a joke would be great.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.940
<v Speaker 1>This one has to have the stage set just a little bit, okay?

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.040
<v Speaker 1>By telling another joke.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:20.820
<v Speaker 1>So there's this funny joke meme that went around like 15 years ago.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.960
<v Speaker 1>There's JavaScript, the definitive guide,

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.600
<v Speaker 1>which is like this 600-page tome of a huge book.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.780
<v Speaker 1>And then Douglas Crawford published a follow-up book

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.580
<v Speaker 1>called JavaScript, the Good Parts.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's like 100 pages.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how big it is, but it's much, much smaller.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.380
<v Speaker 1>then the definitive guide,

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.800
<v Speaker 1>like this is the slice that you should only pay attention to

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.760
<v Speaker 1>and the rest is wrong.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Isn't this funny?

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah, I remember that.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, yeah, it's kind of old.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.580
<v Speaker 1>But here's the new joke.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Error handling.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.200
<v Speaker 1>It's this huge, huge book.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.640
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a little tiny one, error handling before AI.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just like how much you got to deal with and keep track of it.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Like what is all this stuff going on?

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Why is this all here?

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:08.620
<v Speaker 1>It's the opposite.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the inverse of going from a huge thing to like a focused good one.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like, oh, we had this focused little bit of error handling.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.919
<v Speaker 1>Now we got this mega thing we got to deal with.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a joke.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:23.139
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking forward to people.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.679
<v Speaker 2>People are already starting to actually care about making their tests readable

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.800
<v Speaker 2>because they're having to figure out what's wrong.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:33.139
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:33.600
<v Speaker 1>So.

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Me too.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Well, happy 2026 to everybody.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:43.159
<v Speaker 1>Brian, good to see you.

00:34:43.379 --> 00:34:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Looking forward to another year of good stuff.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, we should have little poppers.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, those things.

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Shoot out the little confetti or whatever.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:54.600
<v Speaker 1>But no, we're just going to say goodbye.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:55.659
<v Speaker 1>Goodbye.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Talk to you next week.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.400
<v Speaker 1>See you later.
