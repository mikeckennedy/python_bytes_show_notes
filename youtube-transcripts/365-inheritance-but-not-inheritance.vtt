WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.000
Hey, everybody.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
>> Hello.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
>> Hey.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.000
>> Sneak an attack of the podcast record button.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's go.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
>> Yeah.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Welcome to Python Bytes, everybody.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm excited for another excellent episode.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So let's hit it off.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You ready, Michael?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
>> I am ready.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.240
>> Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.000
to your earbuds.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is episode 365.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Wow.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Recorded -- >> It's like we've been doing it for a year.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
>> Yeah.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Recorded December 19th, 2023.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Yeah.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
>> Hey, I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.600
>> And, yeah, if we did it -- if somebody listened to one a day from, like, now on, they would

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.000
be behind, because we'll be way ahead of 365 by the time they finish.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
>> That would still be awesome.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.400
>> Well, want to kick us off with something cool?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.300
Before we kick it off -- >> Yeah, go ahead.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.160
>> Let's say that this episode is sponsored by us, so please support us and other people.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.440
I'm going to, like, talk about that a little bit later at the end of the show.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.400
But also check out all the courses at Talk Python Training.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.360
Check out the Complete pytest course.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.160
You can be a Patreon supporter.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.760
And also, if you want to connect with us, one of the best ways to do it is through on

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.320
Mastodon.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:40.400
And we're all on Fosstodon, or at least Michael and I are, at mkennedy@brianaukin and @pythonbytes.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400
>> Indeed.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.640
Hey, do I feel like I'm really fast, Brian?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.960
Like Neo in the Matrix?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.720
Like, I'm bendingly fast?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.720
>> Let's go with yes.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.720
>> Okay.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.720
I appreciate that.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.800
Because this -- I just got fiber, gigabit fiber installed 30 minutes ago.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.240
I was hoping it wouldn't destroy the show, but it almost didn't make it, but it made

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.240
it.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.240
>> Ooh, nice.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.600
>> So hopefully that doesn't curse it, that something doesn't go wrong and it will crash.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.480
But 950 megabit down, which is fine, but 950 megabit up is glorious.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.480
>> We should speed up the playback speed when we release the MP3, so it sounds really fast.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.480
>> No, we're talking really fast, because it's really uploading.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.840
Let's talk about Hatch, because Hatch is awesome.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.680
Ofec is the maintainer and creator of Hatch, and boy, oh, boy, has he gone big on his latest

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.160
release, 1.8.0.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.320
So Hatch is like FLIT, is like PDM, is like pip, ENV, and many of these other poetry,

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.000
others, if I'm leaving your version of this out, I apologize.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.400
But with version 1.8, this has gone in a bit of a different direction.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.560
You know, I had Ofec on the Python packaging panel.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.280
I think Steve Dower was there, some other folks were there.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.560
Really interesting that there's this tension between should there be an app that manages

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.840
Python environments with Python, or should there be a thing that manages the Python itself,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.840
right?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.600
Kind of like pyenv, for example, right?

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:33.200
So Hatch has gone in that direction of now Hatch manages Python, not just Python projects.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.920
And there's this thing to solve this problem in the form of PyApp.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.520
So PyApp is even maybe more awesome.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.280
PyApp is a runtime installer for Python projects written in Rust, and they can be -- are you

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.280
ready for this?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.980
I'm so, so excited.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.640
Your Python app can be distributed as a standalone executable, a .exe or a .app for users.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.040
What do you think, Brian?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.360
>> I'm very interested in finding out more.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.360
>> Now this whole post is a little bit wordy, so let me jump into the Omnivore version of

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360
it.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.240
Over here, which has a huge icon.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.080
So Ofec says, look, one of the things that's been a perpetual problem for Hatch and all

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.640
the others I named is that Python itself is a dependency.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.760
So in order to use Hatch or any of these other tools or any apps, you have to say, well,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.540
go get Python and then get back to me and we'll start talking, right?

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.440
So he came up with this thing called PyApp that will create installers for the different

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.440
platforms.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.040
He claims it's trivial.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.000
It's probably never trivial, but possible.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.260
Possible would be awesome even.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:46.560
And so starting with this, releases not only are the binaries available for every platform,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.760
but there are installers, as in like install wizards on Windows and a DMG type thing, I'm

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.960
guessing, or a PKG on macOS.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.620
That's awesome.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:06.920
If you've ever in the recent days, tried to put something onto macOS or Windows, there's

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.560
a whole nightmare of digitally signing around it, Brian.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.840
So you can't just get a binary and give it to somebody that the platforms will freak

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.840
out.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.000
They won't let you open it like macOS will not let you open it unless you go into settings

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.560
and say, allow me to run apps from untrusted developers.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.400
And Windows gives you this big scary dialogue and tries to not run it.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.480
So that's why this next part-

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.400
It's not developers that you don't trust.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.520
It's developers that Apple doesn't trust.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520
Yes, exactly.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.080
You may or may not trust them, but that's a different conversation.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.680
It's a fair feature, but it makes creating desktop distributor apps super painful.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.400
So check this out.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400
Halfway there.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.900
The installer for macOS is signed using a certificate.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.520
So you already, your apps built with this are already trusted.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.800
Honestly, I don't know how this is possible.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.520
I mean, I know why, how it works.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.040
I'm not sure that it, how it's allowed, but I'm all for it.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.360
So because I've dealt with Apple and they are not lenient in any way, shape or form

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.760
when it comes to stuff running on their platform.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.960
But so the installer for the macOS is signed using the certificate from the same account

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.820
used to sign the official distributions of Python.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.140
So you won't get any security warnings or blocking.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.040
Thank you, E-Durban for helping out with that.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.740
And Hatch itself with any good system is self-updating.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.740
So you can hatch self-update.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:38.540
But also I want to point out, there's also a new Python, like Hatch space Python command

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.460
group that will allow you to manage things.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.900
So you can show what you have installed.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.600
You can install different versions of Python, CPython and PyPy for those.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.840
Works with virtual environments.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.280
It has built in rough and Ruff format integrations.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:03.460
And traditionally it's been somewhat slow to like activate and set up a virtual environment

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.320
that's already previously been installed because it'll refresh and recheck that all of the

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.280
dependencies are there and everything.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.540
So now it does a hash of those.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.820
And so only if the dependency statement doesn't match the hash, right, basically.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.960
So it'll pre-compute all that stuff.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.380
So now it should be basically instant.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:29.280
So also some minor breaking changes around build defaults and the new app build targets

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.560
what I've been raving about.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.360
So Ofek, you killed it.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360
I can't believe it.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.360
It's awesome.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.360
Awesome.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.560
So Hatch has hashes?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.580
If you hash a hatch with hashling and you know, like there's some kind of tongue twister

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.580
in there we could do.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.960
I'm not doing it though.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.680
I'm excited about this.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.680
It's very cool.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.680
I definitely want to play with it.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.680
Yeah.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.680
Yes, indeed.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.400
Over to you.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400
All right.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:07.620
Well, I'm not sure how long this has been out, but Hinnik has been promoting a new project

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:15.380
that he's got called services or SVCS, which is short for services and pronounced services.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:22.040
And it is a, I think it could be used for more than web stuff, but the intent I think

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:30.100
was for removing some of the boilerplate code from hooking up dependencies and different

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:37.080
like your database and your cache and all sorts of stuff to an application.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.560
Probably a web application, but I think it could really be anything.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.760
But it's a flexible service locator.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.740
And one of the reasons why I haven't covered it yet on Python bytes, I don't think I have

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.340
is because I didn't quite understand what it was doing and it took me a while to get

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.780
my head around it.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.860
But it's it's pretty cool.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.260
And Hinnik apparently realizes that it is a bit difficult to get your head around what

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.540
this is doing.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:11.380
So he he just recently released a video describing this, this project.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.620
So really great.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.180
Great great video describing services, what you can do with it, and also how to pronounce

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.180
his name.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.820
He doesn't pronounce his last name, though.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.660
Apparently that's left for maybe episode two.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.300
But I guess.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.580
Anyway it's it's pretty cool.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.460
Actually I'm pretty excited about it after after watching it, watching the video.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.900
I thought maybe it wouldn't be for me, but especially for keeping services contained

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:50.460
or the setting up services, looking them up within different parts of your application

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.500
and then and then getting them all cleaned up correctly at the end.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.260
That's kind of what it does, plus a whole bunch of other stuff.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.700
And one of the neat things is throughout all of this documentation, the documentation is

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.700
amazing.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:10.740
Throughout all the documentation, he has examples in AIO, AIO, HTTP, FastAPI, Flask, Pyramid

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.740
and Starlet.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.980
So in some of the videos talking about Flask, but it's cool that he just already hit all

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.060
the bases like how do I do this in Starlet?

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.980
Well, it's just a little different.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:28.340
Most of them, mostly they're similar, but a little different ways to use it throughout

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.340
the different applications.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.940
So it's pretty cool.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:38.540
He also mentions in the video that he took a really long time really talking about the

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.180
terminology in the glossary of the documentation.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.900
And actually, I really appreciate this of somebody saying, OK, this is generally what

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:53.160
I think of is what the reason the meanings for all of these words are.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.500
And it's a lot of these words are are they're overused in the English language to begin

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.580
with and even in talking about programming, web programming.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.500
But things like what is the service?

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.900
What is a resource?

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.460
What is a dependency service layer?

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.300
He goes through a whole bunch of different terms, what it means to him and probably to

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.300
everybody else.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:18.500
But if you're unfamiliar with them and even a decent discussion of dependency injection.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:24.360
So the one of the things he talks about is that this is not a not really a dependency

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.460
injection thing.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.940
It's inversion of control, but it's a little different than service.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.300
Service locators are a little different than dependency injection.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.380
And I kind of appreciate that discussion.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.380
It's pretty cool.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:42.180
So anyway, kudos to Henek for doing this and for helping us pronounce his name.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.060
Yeah, this looks cool.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.340
I definitely want to check this out.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.340
It's news to me.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.940
So I will be checking out.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:50.940
Cool.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.440
Mm hmm.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.620
We have new leaders.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.620
Brian, we do.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.620
Yes.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:02.740
So for the 2021 world, we have new leaders and specifically the steering council election

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.980
results are in for next year.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.180
Okay.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:13.300
So for the 2024 term, we have Pablo Galindo Salgato.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:18.940
We've got Gregory Smith, Emily Morehouse, Barry Warsaw and Thomas Warthers.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.980
So very cool to see them all leading the way.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.380
There's a lot of familiar faces there.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.500
So that's, that's pretty cool.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:32.220
And I don't expect a whole lot of different from the year before, but here's the results.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:41.460
You can actually see in PEP 8105, I see everybody who was potentially a candidate, how many

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.260
votes they got by people who are disenfranchised.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.460
I don't know what that means.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.940
Or the not the franchise voters, the one who are enfranchised, how many votes that they

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:51.940
got.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.480
And you can put that all together.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:59.520
So this begs the question, like, well, how do you get on this list?

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.480
You get on this list by being nominated by a core developer.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.660
So everyone on the list was nominated by a core developer.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.980
If you are a core, not a core developer, if you're a core developer, you can nominate

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.980
yourself.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.980
So that could be the person you see here because everyone I see, I think is a core developer.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.980
Okay.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:21.060
Anyway, the results, the results are in and we have those five folks.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.060
Welcome and congrats.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.060
Awesome.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.060
Nice.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.060
That's a good set of names too.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.060
Yeah.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.060
So yeah.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.060
All right.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.060
Indeed.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:38.740
Well, there probably is some protocol around the election results, right?

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.940
No, you could model it with classes or you could functionally model it like in a immutable

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:48.500
way, but I don't know about a protocol.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.240
We're just great at transitions on this podcast.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.500
The next I want to talk about Python protocols.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:03.880
So there's an article from Carlos Vecina, I think, called Python protocols, defining

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.940
a protocol and when to use it.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.780
And actually this is something that I have, I've been meaning to play with for actually

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.300
some years and I haven't really done much with it yet.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.580
So I really appreciate this article.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:21.720
He's talking about protocols are a feature of Python that were added in Python three

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720
eight.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.800
So really anything maintainable right now can use this, you can use protocols, but they're

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.680
and you kind of, they're in mentally, I think of them kind of like class inheritance

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.640
or mix-ins or abstract base classes.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.200
And that's one of the things he talks about this in this article is, is they are in that

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.000
same similar space, but but you use them a little different and you might use them together

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.520
with other, with other forms too, like with, with mix-ins and abstract base classes.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.960
So the article just goes through on how to define a protocol and really, and he's also

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:05.160
discussed also a decent tutorial on abstract base classes and mix-ins as well, which is

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.400
nice to kind of describe them all together.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:15.280
But the, the protocol thing is just sort of, let me see if I can find an example.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:21.240
So you inherit, you have a class that's inherited from protocol and you give it, you kind of

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.860
give it function definitions, but don't fill in the body.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.580
So that's kind of what a protocol is.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:34.320
And then other, other classes that you, that use the protocol derive from that, you know,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.200
from that protocol, from like in his example, there's a protocol, a class called explainable

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.120
that something that has an explain function.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:48.360
And so you would derive from explainable and then your new class would have, would, would

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.600
be a instances of protocol.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.600
But all it really says is that you can, other places that use it for types and stuff can

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.920
declare that they need some, need a protocol passed in or a explainable class.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.180
And then you can use anything that derives from that.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.440
So pretty cool.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.320
Yeah, Brian, let me jump in and just say one extra point here.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.920
Like what's awesome about this stuff is we've had duck typing like this.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.280
There's an assess fairness function that it has to call, explain on the object passed

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:23.200
in and duck typing said, well, if it takes that, if you can pass it in there and it will

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.880
run when you call explain on it, it must fit.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.880
Right.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.080
But the typing tools don't check.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.800
So like PyCharm, for example, would just go, well, it's a whatever.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.360
So good luck with that.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.640
But once you do this protocol stuff, if you say the function takes an explainable and

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.200
you have explainable as a protocol, you can pass stuff in and it doesn't even have to

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.560
derive from or be related to that protocol in a base class.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.760
Like anything that is passed in there, the type system will look at it and verify it

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.880
has an explain, even if it's in a third party package and you don't control it.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.960
So it's like a way to project typing structure onto a dynamic thing that is not necessarily

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.960
your code.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.960
It's wild.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.960
Cool.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.320
I kind of had that a little bit wrong then.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.320
Awesome.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.320
You can derive from it.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.680
It gives you more information potentially, but it doesn't have to.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.000
You don't even have to, which that's the totally wild aspect.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.400
That's what I think is really different for this.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400
Okay.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.400
Yeah.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.400
Oh, awesome.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.400
That's pretty cool.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.400
No.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400
Yeah.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.080
So clearly I haven't thoroughly read this article, but I do want to get into really

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.760
getting my head around abstract base classes, mix-ins and protocols and new stuff.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.480
I wouldn't say that though, because like your experiences in C++, mine also is in C++ and

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:42.000
C# and all of those languages have these interface ideas, but they're put into the type system

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
through inheritance.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.440
And so you can inherit from it and it does what you expect and it seems the right thing,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.640
but what's weird is you don't even have to.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.440
That's what's weird about it.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.440
Okay.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.440
Oh, awesome.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.800
Now I definitely want to play with it more.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.800
Yeah.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.440
Because I've kind of missed that aspect of C++ in Python.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.440
So nice.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:08.680
Anyway, also I'm assuming it's a AI generated image, but really cool image at the top of

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.680
the article.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.680
It is.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.480
I'm not sure what my opinion is about it yet.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.560
I'll ask ChatGPT how I feel about it.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.040
It's hard to describe how I feel.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.440
So I'll, you know, yeah.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:26.960
I'm actually sort of, I don't know, this is a tangent, but I've switched to, I was playing

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.240
with like Bing as my primary search engine at work.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.240
It just, I don't know, a new computer, it just was there and I'm just going with it

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.360
for a while.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.040
But everything I search is like, it gives me an AI generated answer first.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.760
And I'm like, I don't know if I like that very much.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.760
Yeah, I know.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.760
I know.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.320
Anyway, well, that's it for our main stuff.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.320
Do you have any extras?

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.720
I could have almost made it an extra, extra, extra this time.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.720
So yeah, sure.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.720
I do.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.960
First of all, I've been wanting to say this several times and I'm usually like looking

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.240
at my screen and see what I want to share and stuff.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.520
And I didn't have this anywhere.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.440
So I just pulled up Mastodon to remind me.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.080
There are tons of people interacting with us over on Mastodon and I've had some great

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.280
conversations and I want to, I'm sure you do too, Brian, want to follow people back,

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:19.760
but there's, there's kind of a, at least for, I'll say these are Michael's Mastodon's conventions.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.080
Uh, you, you could take them for what you want.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.600
I just made them up, but this is how I think about it.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.960
So people will follow me and I'm like, huh, did that person follow me?

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.720
Cause they listened to the show and listen to Brian say, you should come join us and

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720
have a conversation.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.920
Hey, I'd like to follow that person.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.520
But a lot of times they have no picture, no description, no webpages, no posts.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.940
You're like, yeah, maybe not next, you know?

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.820
And so I'm just going to say, if you have a picture and a description, a description

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.820
seems somewhat relevant.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.800
I will certainly follow you back.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.700
If you have posts, that's plus one.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.840
If you have a verified webpage, which is easy, another plus one.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.880
And a lot of people have private accounts who follow me.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.840
I'm like, why are you in social media?

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.640
If you want a private account, I don't understand what this is because your profile is public.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.560
Just your posts are private, but the platform has a way to have private posts.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.960
I don't understand.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.280
So anyway, probably not going to get a lot of engagement if you have a private account,

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.760
just post private messages for things you don't want to see.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.560
So, and while I'm on the topic of Mastodon, I had a really nice and productive conversation

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.120
with the PSF around my mask rant on PyCon.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.880
So that was nice over there.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.520
Some people weren't nice as they sent me, like not necessarily nice responses, but the

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.520
PSF did.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.520
And that was cool.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.520
That's nice.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.520
Yeah.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.520
All right.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.880
Next one on the, before you move on, I just want to add my two cents on the, the picture.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:47.080
Um, I also prefer to be able to see who it is, but also primarily if the picture is something

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.560
that they're using on other stuff.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.600
So like if a lot of people have a, their profile picture on there, like the profile picture

00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:00.120
on their blog and on their, and they're primarily a GitHub user and, and they have

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.000
the same profile there, even if it's like a stylized something, but if it's the, if

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.860
it's distinctive and the same everywhere, like glyph for instance, has a, has a, a different

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.120
thing for them.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.680
I I'm okay with that, but most people I think go with their picture.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.160
I think it's the right answer.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160
Yeah.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.760
When I said picture, I don't mean necessarily it has to be your picture.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.760
Just the fact that it's not the default icon, you've taken enough effort to put in something,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.280
even if it's just a picture of a triangle, I don't care, you know?

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280
Yeah.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.280
All right.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.520
Uh, Paul is asking in the audience, what is your secret?

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.520
Okay.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.200
Well, we'll do this.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:45.020
Um, we, earlier on, we were talking about how Michael's got a faster internet now, so

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.540
we should make it really fast speed.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:54.100
Um, and then somebody commented, Waygrant commented, I played it at one and a half times

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.100
speed.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:00.380
Then I got up to a live event, and all of a sudden Brian should, sounded like he

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.220
got drunk in one second.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.420
And so I said, Brian's secret is out.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.420
So nice.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.720
I'll just have another drink of my, Irish coffee.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.720
It's coffee.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.720
Trust me.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.120
Oh, all right.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.360
Uh, more extras.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:23.460
So, Dropbox spooks users with turning on new AI features that can almost automatically

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.640
send your private documents to open AI.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.480
Now you have to interact with part of the site for it to happen, but it doesn't say,

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.320
Hey, necessarily, cause you does, you touch this.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.600
We're now sending your social security number away.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.800
Um, but anyway, that's kind of unnerving.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800
Yeah.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:47.800
So you can check that out on defaulted to on if you're not subject to the GDPR, but

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.920
defaulted to off if you are.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.800
So, you know, plus one for GDPR there, I suppose.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.800
Mine was turned on.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.800
Okay.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.640
So you have to go check to make sure that they're not sharing all of your, yes, exactly.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.380
And it's on by default for you, Brian.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.880
So you might want to check.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.200
There's a whole conversation.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.200
It's on ours.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.240
The, the con the comment section of our tech Nega is like the top notch place for comments,

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.240
I think.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.240
So really good.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.560
You can, yeah, there's, it talks about how to go find it.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.400
So anyway, this like maybe think, you know what?

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.800
I should really be a little more, I have like three terabytes of data and Dropbox.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.440
So I'm like, maybe I should be a little more specific and intentional about where I put

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440
my stuff.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.360
So I went on this, this rant on mastodon, by the way, a bunch of people sent me all sorts

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.980
of options of like, if not Dropbox, then what?

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:40.600
And I decided whatever I'm doing is probably good to have it end to end encrypted.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.280
Cause then I don't care what they try to do with it.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.280
Right.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.280
Cause they can't decrypt it.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280
Yeah.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.280
That, that solves a whole lot of problems.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.200
I don't, you care about social security, but it doesn't matter as much as if you're just

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.320
exposing files or the leaking stuff or whatever.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320
Right.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.600
So I decided to go, I already have a paid proton account.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.160
So all my private stuff, all my private documents, I like my scans of things I want to save that

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.680
might be sensitive.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:10.680
They're going to proton drive where I have 500 gigs and it's already paid for and an

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.720
encrypted, there's async thing you can install.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720
That's pretty excellent.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:19.040
I looked around and some people suggested next cloud, which is really interesting.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.320
And so that may be more than I want.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:26.600
It's almost like a document calendar, everything self-hosted own cloud.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600
Yeah.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.680
Own cloud got like super owned just last week and is a similar self-hosted thing, which

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.400
makes me a little nervous to self host stuff.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.520
I know there are people who host it for you, but it's not next cloud.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.880
It's a little bit indirect.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880
So maybe.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:48.760
Phylon, I don't know if you've heard of this, but they have encrypted cloud storage and

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.880
the end again, pretty nice.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.880
I think this is a British.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.880
I don't, I don't remember exactly.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:02.080
UG, not sure, but somewhere in Europe, this company, it looks pretty good.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:07.640
I have not tried it, but in encrypted there's ice drive, the next generation cloud storage.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.280
Also I think this might be the British one.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.280
Yeah, this is in Wales.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.160
I mean British, I mean UK, sorry folks.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.120
So that's pretty interesting.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.920
And I think, I think I'm going to go with sync.com super simple.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.120
All they do is sync and then encrypted for six terabytes.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:30.240
It's like 140 bucks a year or something like that, which is a lot, you know, versus 240

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.680
for less than that in Dropbox.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.120
Anyway, if people are in this zone of like, I'm looking for all this stuff.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.120
Oh my gosh.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.880
Like, what am I going to do?

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:43.200
Regardless of whether you care about the Dropbox fiasco, here's a bunch of options people can

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.280
pick.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.320
There was one comment in this whole discussion that was pretty interesting.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.320
I think it was in the ours, just ours, Technica thing.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.520
And it said, look, if you give your data unencrypted to somebody, another company, even if you

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.840
trust them, you don't really necessarily control that anymore, especially if they decide to

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.740
pass it along.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.040
So somebody pointed out CryptoMeter.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.160
Have you heard of this Brian?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.160
No.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.560
So CryptoMeter is cool.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.180
I have used something like it, but it's older and no longer supported, which makes me sad.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.800
So what you do is you run this app, it does like super strong encryption.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.800
You control the key, right?

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.080
It's just like a thing you make up and don't give away.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:29.200
And then it will create a drive, a mountable drive on your Mac or on Windows, like a D

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.040
drive or E drive or whatever.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.100
And that thing is encrypted.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.980
So when you mount it with this software, it looks like a drive, but then when you unmount

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.400
it, it becomes just an encrypted pile of files.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.180
So you put that in Dropbox, you put that in sync or whatever.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.920
And then no matter what happens, they just get an encrypted blob of stuff.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.240
So things I super care about, I have encrypted in something, either CryptoMeter or something

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:56.200
like it, on top of all the safety around the cloud drive and trust and whatever you might

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.200
have there.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.080
Like worst case scenario, they get a huge, hard, hard to decrypt a blob of stuff that

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.720
they don't know the value of.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.720
And I don't know if it has Linux.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.000
Someone's asking does it have Linux.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.400
I think it might.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.400
Let's see.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.400
Mac.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.280
No, let's see if I go to download what it says.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.280
Download.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.280
It's worth knowing for people.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.280
Downloads.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.280
Use your DMG.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.280
Yeah, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS even.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.280
Yeah.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.280
So that's that.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.800
I think that it's a loss.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:37.960
I mean, cool, but CryptoMeter would have been great as a rotten tomato sort of thing to

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.960
rate different cryptocurrencies.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.960
I know.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.280
The word is taken.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.440
I'm pretty sure this has been around before crypto became a thing.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:56.440
Like I'm not sure how old this is, but yeah, there's 17 pages of releases on GitHub from

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.520
2017.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.800
So yeah, they were ahead of their time in that.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.560
But yeah, this is super cool, Brian.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.720
Like you can just say, I don't really care that much about the security of where these

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.720
files go.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.960
You're not getting them.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.120
Interesting.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.480
So I suggest a sweet combination of these things.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.160
I'm going through like a super digital decluttering as part of this, and it's glorious.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.960
I'm having like a tech love affair with Notion.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.440
It's so good.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.360
But yeah, anyway, I'll leave it there.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.320
Maybe I'll come back and tell you more about this.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:34.760
Last thing for me, I'm doing the keynote at PyCon Philippines 2024 in February.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.760
How awesome is that?

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.400
Somewhere I scroll down and over.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.400
Woo.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.400
Yeah.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.360
Three of us and I get to be one of them.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.360
So that'd be awesome.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.360
Thank you for inviting me.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.440
And if you're going to be there, I will see you there.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.440
Nice.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.440
Yeah.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.440
In February.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.440
Cool.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.440
Oops.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.240
Over to you for your extras.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.120
Well, I just deleted one.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.440
So sorry about that.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.240
Shift command T. Shift.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.240
Commit.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.680
I'll just tell you guys about it.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:15.880
So this is the kind of time of year that some people like to donate some money to different

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.680
people, different groups.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.000
I had the link up for the Python Software Foundation.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.360
So Python Software Foundation is not hard to find.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:31.240
So I would encourage people to consider giving some money to the PSF.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.000
Also Django Software Foundation is doing a drive.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.840
So given some money if you use Django, of course, if you enjoy Python Bytes, of course,

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.960
you can check out Patreon.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:49.800
Patreon, we do accept money for Python Bytes to help keep the show going.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.160
This is great.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:58.220
Also, I wanted to highlight as well, just the idea that to just go on GitHub.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:03.200
So the different things you use on GitHub, like adders, for instance, you can go down

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.560
and you can sponsor this project.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.480
You can throw some money that way.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.720
pytest has a sponsor link.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:18.800
Pallets and Flask has a way to sponsor either all of pallets or particular projects within

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.960
the pallets program.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:28.700
And really a lot of projects that you use every day have a sponsor this project on GitHub.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:33.580
So I think it'd be great for people if you have extra and you want to help out, I think

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.940
it's a good idea.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:40.100
Sometimes I help out different projects and I kind of shift it up every year and local

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:44.060
things and I think the things that I use.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:50.460
And somebody asked me once recently about like some projects don't really need the money

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:56.460
and I guess like, for instance, I really love having people support Python Bytes through

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.460
Patreon.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.420
It's fun to have our community help support us.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:05.100
It's not if you if you in particular don't donate, we're not going to disappear.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.180
Michael and I are going to keep doing it anyway.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.460
It is totally up to you and definitely don't do it if it's a hardship.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.740
But I think it's a fun thing to do this time of year is to spread the love around.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.740
That's all I wanted to say.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.620
Indeed, I second that as well.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.900
That's kind of serious, though.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.180
Do you have something funny for us?

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.180
Let's lighten it up.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.180
No, this is not funny.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.140
This is too close to home.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.300
You tell me how you feel about this.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.300
So here's the joke.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.300
Here's the joke.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.820
So there's two red buttons.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.180
Think Ren and Stimpy or something like that and a huge scary red button.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.320
You can press either of them.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.920
One of them says, pay $12.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.620
The other one says, admit to yourself, your dream is dead.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:53.820
Somebody's sweating trying to decide which button to press and it's the domain renewal.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.560
Oh, yeah, totally.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:03.020
This is way too close to home for me because I just transferred 25 domains from all the

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:07.540
different places into Hover as I talked about a while ago and I talked about all the name

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.580
servers and all that.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.580
There was a few where I'm like, God, is the dream dead or do I just move this?

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.620
So how many are you using still?

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:21.780
Well, lots of them are to protect people from doing crappy stuff.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.980
For example, I have talkbython.com.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.940
I don't technically use it.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.260
It redirects to talkpython.fm.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.340
But if I don't have it, someone will get it.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.180
And then all sorts of badness.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.180
There's a bunch of these guard.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.420
I would say half of them fall into that realm.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.700
And then maybe another third I'm directly using.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.580
And then there's the whatever the balance, the one sixth that's left is the dream could

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:45.580
be dead.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.820
Or it could be not there yet, not realized yet.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:48.820
We'll see.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:53.540
>> I had about eight that I was not really using last year.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:33:02.220
And I admitted that about half of those are not going to go anywhere and let them expire.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.900
Although I mean, the domain companies don't make it easy.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.740
You're like, okay, I'm just going to let it expire.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.180
But you get like emails.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.140
No, it's going to go.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.140
It's gone.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.260
But we're going to save it for you for a couple more months.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.580
And you get a whole bunch of guilt emails.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.580
But yeah, anyway.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.580
>> Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:24.220
I have one real quick sad story to round this out, Brian.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.940
A friend of mine and I decided we're going to write some iPhone apps right when the iPhone

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:32.620
came out, like 2007 or whatever it was.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.100
And he had the clever idea of like, let's get a domain.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.100
I probably did it together.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.100
I don't know.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:42.020
Got the domain, iPhone.ly, iPhone-ly.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.740
And we worked on stuff for like a year because we didn't know we're going to build.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:47.740
We're just like, come up with this.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.140
We'll put stuff there.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.260
Never really came up with stuff.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.780
It looked like there was nothing on the horizon.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.180
We're like, you know, after three years, the ly, it was like the FM.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.180
It was like kind of expensive.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.780
Like, ah, just let it go.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:03.480
A week later, somebody says, hey, I'll give you $5,000 for that domain.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.220
So I shoot my friend like, hey, don't let it expire yet.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.220
Let's do this instead.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.940
He's like, it expired last week.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:09.940
I'm like, no.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:10.940
>> Oh, no.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.380
>> Oh, well, so it goes.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.580
>> So somebody could have paid you $5,000, but they instead got it for like 20.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.100
>> They got it for like 20 bucks or something.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.780
>> I'm sorry to laugh at your pain.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.780
>> No, it's okay.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.940
I mean, it's like, I'm telling you, this is not a joke.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.780
Admit to yourself your dream is dead or pay $12 for the rest of your life every year.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:31.780
That's where you are.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.780
No, it's good.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.500
It's a good joke and people can hopefully laugh at it.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.900
>> Yeah, everybody, most people that listen to this podcast probably are feeling this.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.900
>> Yeah, it is.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.900
>> All right.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.540
Well, I'm feeling good about our year's worth of show every day.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.500
>> Yeah, 365, pretty cool.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.500
>> Yeah.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.500
>> All right.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.500
Talk to you later.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.500
>> Yeah.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.500
See you.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:55.500
Thanks, everyone.
