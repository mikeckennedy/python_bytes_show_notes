00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.760
Hey, Michael. Hey, everybody out there in Python land and the internet worlds and interwebs.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.860
Happy Monday. I'm excited.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:21.380
What is the day after a day? Like, Eve is the day before, the evening before, but what is the, I was going to say, Super Bowl day after.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.300
Whatever that is. Happy that day.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.220
Happy leftover chips and dip day, I guess.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.980
Exactly. Time for soggy nachos, everyone. Enjoy them.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:40.500
Yeah, I had an egg sandwich with seven-layer dip filling this morning for breakfast. It was delicious.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.800
Love it.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.380
Okay, let's talk Python.

Yeah, that's great.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.300
Well, I am excited about this first topic, Michael.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.940
So let's kick it off.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.380
Thanks, Brian.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.220
So this one is a homegrown topic.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.520
So I've created a new app.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.440
And I got to tell you, this is one of the very first proper desktop applications I have shipped in a long time.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.860
Like, when was the last time that you shipped a desktop app?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.520
Like, I tell you, it's been years for me.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.600
I don't think I ever have.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.160
Yeah.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.740
Well, I used to do a lot of Windows development and build, like, legit desktop apps.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.480
I worked at this scientific visualization company.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.540
We'd build, like, things to do, data processing and visualization.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.920
And this predates the web being real powerful for that.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.440
So I used to do.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.280
Oh, I guess I did way back when.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.840
Systems.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.340
I mean, that used to be the way.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:20.940
And so I've been working building a ton of web apps, which is what drove me to build a desktop app, which is strange.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.120
But here's the deal.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.520
I built this thing called Command Book.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:33.980
And the idea is, as developers, we have a lot of long-running processes that we keep in the terminal.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.080
Okay?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.960
I want to tail this log.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.000
I want to turn on some monitoring software.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.900
I want to run this web app.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.940
Oh, yeah, but the web app also has this background daemon thing.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.000
So I've got to run that.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.800
And I want to run the database that powers that, those two things.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.960
So then you end up with, like, four terminal tabs, all that just say Python, Python, Python, Docker.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.900
And you're like, huh.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.660
Well, I need to go see the output of one of those.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.920
Which one do I go to?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.340
Like, maybe it's this Python.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.780
No, no, that Python, right?

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.000
Oh, guess what?

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.460
I set it to auto-reload so that as I'm working on the code or Claude Code is working on the code,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.640
I don't have to keep closing the web app, opening it back up, then refreshing it.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.340
I can just set it up to auto-reload or set it in dev mode with reload true, that kind of thing.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.540
That works great, except for if the timing lines up such that your app detects a change,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.760
but the code is in an invalid state, like you're typing def function, open parenthesis,

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.980
but you haven't closed it yet.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.520
Boom.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.340
It tries to reload.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.940
It goes, cannot parse code, shuts down, and won't reload ever again.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.760
You're like, ah, now I've got to go find it amongst those tabs again, right?

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.960
So that's the kind of the thing I'm like, can we just do better?

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.780
Like, do these long-running commands, should they really be four or five terminal tabs?

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.120
No.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.020
So I created this thing called Command Book.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.320
And the idea is that you take those long-running commands and you put them into an app, a native app,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.060
that runs them with just the same output, but a bunch of bonuses.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.880
And then you keep your terminal for actually, I want to do commands that are more short-lived, right?

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:22.740
And also lets you jump around really quick from, like, I want to quickly see what this log looks like.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.340
Oh, I also, I need to turn on this database thing real quick.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.580
Boom.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.500
Hit this, you know, hit this thing to run it.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.120
And so here I even have a little example.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.200
I can even run the Python Bytes thing.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.940
So if you check out the video, you can see the app in action.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.620
But link to the website at commandbookapp.com.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.500
And so it does a bunch of cool things.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.340
So, like, if I go and edit, it has a command palette.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.760
So if I want to type anything with Hugo, like I want to publish the Talk Python blog,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.140
I just type Hugo and find that.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160
Or I want to publish this one.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.020
Or I want to just run my personal blog.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.240
Hit that one.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.420
Off it goes.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.660
And it doesn't just do that because what else is it doing?

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.780
You don't want to have merge conflicts.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.420
So it runs git pull.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.820
You can specify what to do.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.180
It runs git pull before it runs your server every time you say run your server.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.040
And it makes sure no matter where you are, you're always in the right directory, that kind of stuff.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.020
And you can, like, chain them with ampersand, ampersand, which is like a Linux terminal thing.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.280
And it will auto-detect those, break them apart, run them as multiple commands and that kind of stuff.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.860
So, yeah, I think this is just super neat.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.000
It detects all the URLs that are shown.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.160
So if the thing to start the browser to the right place scrolls off the screen, you don't have to scroll.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.180
It shows you uptime, how much memory is being used.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:51.160
There's a bunch of cool little things that you can do if you just go, like, maybe these long-running things don't need to live in my terminal all the time.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.680
Because you'll have messages like, oh, there's an update for warp.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.780
You're like, yeah, but I don't really want to install it right now because all this other stuff has been going for a day.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.540
And I want to shut it down.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.260
Like, do those need to be the same thing?

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.180
So I hope people really like this.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:10.920
There's a free and a paid version over at commandbookapp.com.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:17.000
I spent about three full-time weeks working on this thing.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.460
And I'm really proud of how it came out.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.180
I think it has a bunch of cool features that are not obvious.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.900
But as you start to work with it, oh, and that's cool.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.900
And I built it with SwiftUI if people are interested.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.120
The back end is all Python, of course.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.060
But the app itself is SwiftUI.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.900
It's like 20 megs.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.340
It's not a huge electron thing.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.020
And it starts in.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.160
I'm excited about trying this out, Michael.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.820
This is neat.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.880
I like the stop all.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.760
And also, like, there's a.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.240
So I don't normally have stuff running for, like, a long time, like, days.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.460
But I do have things that I run regularly in the background.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:02.700
Like you said, running a server or something like that, or that I kind of forget all the

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.640
command, all the prompts that I, the command line things that I usually add to it.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.520
And having them already there, just waiting.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.140
And I can go, oh, yeah, run that.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:12.720
It's right there.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.180
Yeah, totally.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:15.660
Awesome.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.220
Thanks, Brian.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.700
I totally agree with that.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.200
Because it's like, oh, I got to change directory to here and then activate the virtual environment.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.200
And then I run this command.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.180
Oh, I forgot that flag.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.980
And then I got to change directory there.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.260
And it's just like, click, click, click.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.060
Or you can group them and say, just run all of these things for this project.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.420
It's pretty neat.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.220
So my experience building with SwiftUI and publishing, this has to be, like, signed and

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.180
notarized by Apple, which made me worry, given my last experience.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.400
And I hinted at this last time we talked.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:48.940
It was a lot better to distribute a desktop app, even though it has to be signed.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.940
You've got to digitally sign it and notarize it with your developer key.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:09:00.100
But then you've got to put it into one of those DMG things that you open up and drag from, like, over to the apps folder.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.800
That's how the Mac stuff installs.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.700
You've got to digitally sign and notarize that.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.260
And I'm like, oh, my gosh.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.320
Where are they going to tell me I've got to add in-app purchasing for this just so they can have more money, you know?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.420
No, it was way better.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:20.500
And one final wild sort of it's turtles all the way down thing.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.340
With this app down here, I can run the website for Command Book app, of course.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.280
But I can also build Command Book itself.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.000
Like, so the app has a command that builds itself.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:47.640
And then it has another command that will actually notarize and sign the app and build the installer and upload it to the server and set up an auto-update sequence that starts kicking off from within the app.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.640
It's super cool.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.740
So, yeah.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.560
Anyway, people, check commandbookapp.com out.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.020
It's neat.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.740
For now, it's Swift only.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.580
If I get a bunch of people going, Michael, where's my Windows version?

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.080
I will gladly build us a Windows version.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.420
Gladly?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.020
Hey, I'm going to build this baby in Windows forms.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.080
I'm going back old school.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.100
I love that.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.440
It's like the BB6 style.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.200
And I would be happy to do it.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:22.000
But, again, I'd have to figure out how to notarize stuff on Windows, which I think is even harder these days.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.480
Can I get it in DOS 6.2?

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.800
You know what?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.660
No, we only support Dr. DOS.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.580
No, I think this is a fun app.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.200
And hopefully people can check it out.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.460
Maybe I can inspire some people to write some other desktop apps as well, right?

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:43.920
Like it's not a terrible idea, even though the web is a really nice option these days.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:44.900
Yeah.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.420
Over here.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.140
Well, let's see.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.640
What do I got?

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.380
I wanted to talk about uvx.sh.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.900
So this came out from Astral.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.600
Install Python tools with a single command.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.620
Powered by uv.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.800
Okay.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.620
So I didn't quite know what to make of this.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.640
I know that we use curl sometimes to install.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.240
If you want toinstall ruff, you can use curl or actually uv.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:18.300
If you want to install uv, you use the curl to pull in an sh and install it and stuff.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.580
But like why other stuff?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:26.700
So I was really glad that Tim Hopper wrote a couple articles about it.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:33.920
So Tim Hopper wrote uvx.sh install Python tools without uv or Python.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.740
And then also how to install Python CLI tools without Python.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.160
So Astral has released UVA.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.680
I'm just going to read right here.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:50.220
Astral has released uvx.sh, a service that generates installation scripts for any Python tool on PyPI.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:56.840
With a single curl or PowerShell command, users can install tools like rough pytest, a nice example,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:03.980
without having uv or Python already installed in their system.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.760
Now this sort of makes sense.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.240
So you've got like something, I don't know, some people that need to write, you want to distribute something.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.800
And distribution is hard sometimes.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.100
And you maybe don't want to write a Windows app.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:24.800
You could do something like this and use this service to distribute your stuff.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.640
Or, you know, as long as you publish it, I guess.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.320
This is super interesting because it does not, it just takes one more step out of the sequence.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:40.260
Like the much improved sequence was first you figure out however the heck you install uv with curl.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.040
And then you can start running uv tool install or uv run.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:51.420
But now you just go straight to the thing that you're actually trying to get to, even though it makes uv happen, right?

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.060
I like it.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.560
Yeah, so I'm not sure.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.380
Like, so clearly it's installing without Python or uv.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.480
So somehow it's like sort of doing a shimmed version of both maybe?

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.000
I think step one is basically run the curl install command for uv.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.320
And then step two is then uv toolinstall ruff or whatever it is you picked.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.500
I think it's like just those two things and one CLI command.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:17.900
Okay.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.800
Anyway, interesting.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.740
And thanks, Tim, for writing up some examples.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:25.780
Yeah.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.540
Anyway, I don't know if I'll use it, but that doesn't matter.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.360
A lot of people will.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.240
I already know where I can start putting this in.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:35.920
So this is sweet.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:45.780
And really quick before we move on to the next topic, the command book app is a GUI Swift UI app.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.720
But it also has a command line CLI.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.820
So anything that you can do in the GUI, you can do in the CLI.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:14:01.820
And just like if you've constructed one of these really careful commands with like six steps, you can just, you know, command book space, name of your command, and boom, off it goes.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:02.900
And they're always in sync.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:10.740
Which is kind of weird for a desktop app that seems very GUI focused.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:11.440
All right.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.260
But let's move on.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.940
I want to talk about sub process polling.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:24.540
Now, this is actually a good follow on from command book because all that thing does is just run a bunch of sub processes and stream the output and check on their ending.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.100
And do you know what it's been doing?

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.000
Hey, is that done?

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.300
Let me wait a second.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:29.840
Is that done?

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:30.680
Is it done?

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.440
Is it done?

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.280
Is it done?

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.300
Like, no, that is not great.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.280
So I want to talk about this thing called ending 15 years of sub process polling.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.540
So this comes to us from Guillaume Polo.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:51.520
And it says from Python 3.3 until today, we've always had code that goes like this.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:59.360
While we're waiting for some amount of time, get us, you'll wait on this, get us details about this process.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:14:59.980
Is it done?

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:00.720
No.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.620
Time.sleep.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.100
Okay.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.040
We're going to do it again.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.540
Is it done?

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.280
Time.sleep.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:13.440
And obviously, this means that there's a bunch of effort going into just sitting there and spinning over and over.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.800
There's an extra CPU time.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800
Yeah.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:15.820
Yeah.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.920
It sounds like it's not that big of a deal.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.820
Like, oh, you just, you know, it sleeps for a tenth of a millisecond.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.100
So at first, and then like it backs off as it gets longer.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.000
So it sleeps for up to 40 milliseconds.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.120
Great.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.480
So that's like zero CPU usage.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.860
But let me tell you where it does matter.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:45.840
If you think a little bit more deeply, when you've got multiple processes running and checking on things and so on, and your process says, I need to just wake up for a second.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.420
Oh, there's nothing for me to do.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.440
Let me go back to sleep.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:55.300
It's blown out the L1, probably L2 cache of that CPU that it ran on.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.980
And then it just went back to sleep.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.780
You're like, great.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.480
You woke up to like wreck the room and you left.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:00.940
Right.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.200
Because I don't know.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:15.380
A lot of people know this, but not everyone, I'm sure, is if you try to access memory from your program and it's in the L2 cache, that's 400 times, 200 to 400 times faster than you have to access it.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.820
And it's in regular RAM.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.960
It's not in the cache.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.540
So that's a huge challenge.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.640
There's a bunch of things like this, plus the latency.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:30.400
Like, you know, it might not be a huge deal that it might be 20 milliseconds until you actually see the end.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.860
But still, it's not ideal.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:40.360
So it turns out that all POSIX systems provide at least one mechanism to be notified when a file descriptor becomes ready.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.560
But here's the thing that unlocked it.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:53.300
So he said, until recently, I believe that this could only be used with file descriptors like files and sockets and so on.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.860
But it turns out a file descriptor can also be a process ID.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.080
Oh.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.940
How about that for great naming and documentation?

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.320
I didn't know that.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:01.920
Yeah.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.660
But so what you can do is you can just give it the process ID and just go, wait until this thing is done.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.740
And wake me up when it's done.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:19.180
And Linux in 2019 introduced PID FD underscore open, which was added to the OS module for Python 3.9.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.720
And it returns a file descriptor and a descriptor referencing the PID.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:24.300
Right?

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.780
So it can be used in conjunction with a select, a pull, or an e-pull.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.720
These are like OS level things to effectively wait until it exits.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.460
So that works well there.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.000
macOS, I believe, has always had this thing called KQ, which always has had this pulling capability.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.380
And then Windows.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.040
Actually, Windows is the winner here.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.820
Now, it's fun to like, oh, Windows is in the corner eating glue.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:45.700
No.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.280
Not this time.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.580
In fact, Windows is the only one that had native support from the beginning.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:01.940
So there's a Win32 call, I believe, wait for single object or something like that, which has always been able to just wait for a process to end.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.100
And it can fall back to pulling if it has to.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.720
So anyway, pretty interesting.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.460
And the big news is this bad boy right here has been merged by Victor Stinner.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.160
And you can go, actually, I'll link to the pull request.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.800
Pull request 144,047.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.460
That was merged two weeks ago.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:23.680
Pretty cool, huh?

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:24.360
Yeah.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.980
So that'll be in 315.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:26.660
Exactly.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:27.580
Yes, exactly.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.020
Okay.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.760
Exactly, exactly.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.380
So yeah, people can check that out.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.760
And you don't have to do anything.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:38.320
You just, your sub process, your multi-processing, et cetera, gets a little better.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:40.760
Yeah.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.360
Cool.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.140
Also, actually, there are some people that are already doing extra things to try to get around.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.400
And in 315, they won't have, they'll be able to get rid of those workarounds.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:51.160
Oh, yeah.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.440
Okay.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:52.340
Yeah.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.720
So, okay.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:02.140
I mostly was, wanted to talk about this next topic because of the name.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.760
So, Pedantic came out with Monty for Monty Python, of course.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.460
So, Monty Python is experimental.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.380
This project is still in development.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.120
Not ready for prime time.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.480
But, you know, sure.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.600
FastAPI is still on zero over.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.680
So, who knows?

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.960
So, I think.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.860
Sorry, FastAPI, if I'm wrong.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.020
Okay.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.680
So, Pedantic folks.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.280
Lise Monty, minimal secure Python interpreter written in Rust for use by AI.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:39.160
Wait a second.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.140
I don't know if this is the first one.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:51.180
But a programming implementation of a language primarily intended to be used by AI.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:51.820
Hmm.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.500
I don't know if there's others.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:54.460
Anyway.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.760
It's minimally, minimal secure interpreter.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:12.160
It says, Monty avoids the cost, latency, complexity, and general faff of using a full container-based sandbox for running LLM-generated code.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:24.360
So, I'm guessing that a lot of people are in some process are saying, hey, like sandbox this so that the AI doesn't escape and try to take over the world.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.380
All right.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.480
Maybe it can only access these directories.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.500
Maybe it can't call these kernel methods or something, right?

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:31.900
Who knows?

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.280
Yeah.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:44.460
And we get, like, you know, so promises from the Claude people and other people that they've, like, turned off reasonable things or, like, things that we, but, you know, who knows?

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.340
So, there's a subset of what Monty can do.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:56.440
It has a reasonable subset of Python code enough for your agent to express what it wants to do.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.820
Completely block access to the host environment.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.720
No access to the file system, environmental variables, or network access.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.100
This is interesting.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:09.700
Okay.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:18.160
File system, environmental variables, and network access are all implemented via external function calls that the developer can control.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.500
Okay.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.520
So, it doesn't completely block it, but the developer can control what it can have access to.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.260
That's cool.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:33.280
Anyway, so, there's basically this minimal Python set that controls what your AI can do with it.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.760
Kind of interesting.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:35.780
I'm not sure.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.740
It can't do.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.380
It can't do standard library yet.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:47.460
So, I'm not sure exactly where this use model is, but I'm interested to watch and see what's going to happen with this.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.180
So, any take on this at all, Michael?

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.480
I'm very excited about it.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.920
When I do like to troll the GitHub feed.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.340
I used to think that was a dumb thing.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:21:59.860
I'm like, what is this?

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:00.940
It's in my way of my code.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.480
Like, get out of here.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.120
I actually really love the GitHub feed.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:09.820
And I was watching it a day and a half ago or something, and I saw this come by, and I saw Samuel Colvin was behind it.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.180
I'm like, yes, this is interesting.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.520
So, he and I are talking next week.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.920
I think it's next week.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:16.200
No?

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:16.700
Wait.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.680
It might be tomorrow.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.120
I'm like, you know that joke for the progress monitor or the progress bar for the Windows guy?

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:24.520
Yeah.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.260
No, it is.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.960
It's next Tuesday, the 17th.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.280
The joke is, I'm on my way to your house.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.100
I'll be there in about half an hour.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:33.460
No.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.260
Wait.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:34.960
It's going to take a day.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.320
Actually, I'm at your front door, right?

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.060
That's kind of how I feel.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.540
No, I'm talking next, not Tuesday, not next, not tomorrow, but the week after tomorrow.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.740
I said, hey, when I saw this come by, I'm like, this is looking like it could be a huge thing.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:47.740
Let's talk.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.560
So, that was my take, right?

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.000
Okay.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:51.700
Email Samuel.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.780
Say, this looks awesome.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:53.740
How do we share it?

00:22:53.740 --> 00:23:01.620
His announcement when he said it was something like, it might be a little early for this, but what the heck?

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.760
Here we go, right?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.380
And sharing it.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.660
And that thing like maybe the standard library and so on is a bit of that.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:10.300
Right.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.160
Look, the possibility of what's on the other side of this is incredible, right?

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:22.160
Like if we get a fully working Python or nearly fully working, right?

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:29.380
One of the things that you can do when you're doing this kind of stuff is you're like, well, do we really need to support that edge case that was carried over from 2.4?

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:30.500
No.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.720
The AI is not going to try to do that anyway.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.300
You know what I mean?

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:40.020
Like you can cut some corners and like drop some baggage, which may or may not make it generally useful.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.560
But I don't know.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.240
I think it's super interesting.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:49.120
So how, like, okay, hype driven development maybe.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.500
He just announced it like within the last week.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.500
And it's got 2,000 stars already.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:56.240
Yeah.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:56.840
I know.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:02.820
A day ago when I saw it or something, it had like 500 stars, but it was going click, click, click.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:03.860
You know, it was incredible.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.260
Yeah.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.120
It shows you the faith and the trust that the Pydantic team has earned.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.560
And, you know, I don't know.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.320
Well deserved.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.420
Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:22.100
Also, one of their big projects, not just Pydantic, but is Pydantic AI, right?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.000
So they've got a whole like agent system for running AIs and stuff.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.940
And so this is like a really interesting building block to make that more of a self-contained world, you know?

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.020
Yeah.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:34.900
Yeah.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.160
It's also possible that they're already using it.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.440
It's just they're trying, they're exposing it for other people to have access to or something.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.600
But it absolutely is a popular one.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.660
And all that, cool.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.780
They're also, they're using Cod Speed also.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:50.500
We covered that.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.400
Oh, yeah.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.040
Yeah, they are.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.840
Okay, cool.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:54.880
Sweet.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:55.240
All right.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:55.700
All right.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.600
Well, that's it for our main stuff, right?

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:58.320
Yep.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.000
Yep.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.120
Do you have any extras?

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.720
Yes, I do.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.680
Yes, I do.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.900
Let's jump over here to the extras.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.860
First off, command book.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.120
No.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.880
No, but more CLIs from Talk Python things.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.340
This is another thing that I wrote.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.620
I have a couple of things that I wrote, actually, that I want to talk about.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:23.540
So a while ago over at Talk Python, I added this MCP and AI section, right?

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.420
And I talked about that.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.380
Like, okay, here's how you can plug that into Clod and other systems and the LLMs.txt.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.980
But it occurred to me, as I played with different AI tools trying to make it talk to this thing,

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:35.720
like, you know what?

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.220
Most things don't do MCPs.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:47.120
And even the ones that do, most of the users of those projects don't install the custom MCP into their thing.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:57.380
So could I give people access to all the Talk Python data in a more wide-ranging way, right?

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:03.420
So I decided the way to do that would be to create a Talk Python CLI.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.480
So now you can listen to this.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.400
How recent is this, Brian?

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.000
I literally have not written this down.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:21.800
But in my mind, I can uvx-sh slash Talk Python CLI with dashes install.sh.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:28.060
And then I will be able to just type things like, down here somewhere, I could just type Talk Python,

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.460
then episodes, search, put some text in there, or Talk Python guests list,

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.040
or Talk Python guests get and give them an ID that came from the list.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.900
And basically all the data that is behind Talk Python, which is insane.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:49.580
I have 7.5 million words in the corpus of content at Talk Python.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.080
Wow.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:51.820
Yeah.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:57.500
If you take the transcripts, the show notes, the guest bios, and you go, how many words is that?

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.620
7.5 million.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.200
It's a couple.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:06.000
So this is a huge resource for people to go back and use to ask questions like,

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.640
what has changed over time and so on, right?

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.720
So I thought it'd be really cool to create this CLI tool for that.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.320
And so I have.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.060
Oh, that's cool.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:14.960
Yeah.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.000
So super easy.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.100
It's all written in Python.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.240
Install it with uv.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.720
And then once you install it, you have a Talk Python, no spaces, command, right?

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.820
Oh, one final thing is it has three different outputs.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.700
It has, does anyone in here?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.340
I don't know.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:30.960
No, it doesn't in there.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.400
But you can have, yeah, it does.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.380
Normally it puts out text formatted by the rich library, you know, Will Guggen, of Will Guggen.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:39.420
Yeah.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.500
It's creation.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.880
But it can also put out JSON, which is good for apps.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.000
And it can put out Markdown, which is really good.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.580
If you would say, go to Claude Code and say, hey, Claude, use this Talk Python thing and talk to it and give me answers or something.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.180
You know what I mean?

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.800
So for any agentic stuff, give it the Markdown one.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.400
That's what those want, which is, I always thought JSON, but no.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.620
Markdown is what they want.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.000
Very weird.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:01.720
Okay.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:11.860
Speaking of which, I wrote a little riff on someone else's article called It's Not Vibe Coding, Agentic Engineering.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:18.740
This guy, Adi Azimani, wrote a really good article.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:24.220
This guy's from one of the Google teams called Agentic Engineering.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.500
So I wrote some stuff about that.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.160
People can check that out if they want.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:35.720
Honestly, the idea is like, I think a lot of serious work with agentic coding tools and vibe coding.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.020
Hey, my manager made this last night.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.900
Now we have to build it.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.960
Like those two worlds get grouped into one thing.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.680
And this article is a little bit to like, love it or hate it.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.100
There's two different things you should be talking about in this world.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.300
So check that out.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.700
GitHub was having a day this morning.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.520
Did you notice this?

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:52.640
No.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.260
Yeah.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:00.340
I got the magic unicorn and status code 503 just trying to do some work getting ready for the show.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.020
So the issues didn't work.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.000
Pull requests were degraded.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.200
Actions were degraded.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.540
It says other things were fine.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.460
But like going to the website wouldn't work.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.580
It would 503.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.080
I couldn't get clone anything.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.440
So if you're having problems this morning, you know, many people were.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.540
Python 3.14.3 is now available.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.140
Third maintenance release of 3.14.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:30.080
So I really dislike this format.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.620
I mean, whoever wrote it, thank you for writing it out.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.640
But I do dislike this format of, hey, we got this new minor.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.760
We have this release.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.460
I'm going to tell you about all the changes that have happened over the last year.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.580
All I want to know is the changes in this release.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:45.260
Yeah.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.960
If I want to know the changes that have lasted over year over year, I could go check that out.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.180
But it says, here's the changes of 3.14 to 3.13.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.260
You're like, no.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.700
Well, what about the one that I had before?

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.700
Like, how is this related?

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.300
Do you know what I mean?

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.900
I know if I track it down, there's other places I can find that information.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.860
But I don't have it on the screen.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.100
Yeah, but you have to track it down.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.840
Why wouldn't it be right here?

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:06.500
Yeah.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.860
What is the value of saying this like eight times before you say, you know what I mean?

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.620
Anyway, it's weird.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.180
So just restate the changelog year over year.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.220
But awesome.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.400
Upgrade to this.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:27.540
This is the wildest story.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.900
Absolute wildest story.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.420
And my last extra, Brian.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:31.900
Okay.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.500
This is already out of date because the number is wrong.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:42.300
But Wall Street just lost $285 billion.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:51.680
The valuation of companies like Salesforce, a bunch of sort of offshoring, like support

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:58.300
team programmer companies, like, hey, we have a bunch of experts who will like be your

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.340
legal review and like write code to help you do that kind of stuff and so on.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.360
They just lost $285 billion because of 13 markdown files.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.160
And the markdown files are short, by the way.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.120
This is not like an Epstein type thing where like some thing has been revealed.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:26.160
So we live in this like in this weird dichotomy of two bizarre viewpoints.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.340
One, AI is a fad.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.420
The bubble is going to burst.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.980
And that's just not very much of an important thing.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.100
So, you know, don't even bother learning it.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:35.900
It's going to crash.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.940
It's never going to replace people.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.980
Remember, we've replaced, we tried all these layoffs.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.720
They try to replace people with AI.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:42.340
It's going badly.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.820
Like there's a hundred of those articles.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:53.180
This article says Anthropic released something that would help Claude Code basically do better

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:53.880
legal work.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:32:00.160
So all of these companies lost $285 billion because it was so good.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:06.040
And all it is, literally all it is, is if you go to knowledgeworkplugin.com slash legal on the Anthropic

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:15.000
Claude Code repo, it's just a handful of markdown files that are just pre-prompts or skills to be given to Anthropic.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.800
How insane is that?

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.360
That's, yeah.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:21.940
That's something.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.480
It is something.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.280
So we live in this world where both AI is a bubble that's going to pop.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.540
And even just a few focus prompts will destroy large companies.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.840
So I don't know.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:33.320
It's good.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.200
We're going to see how it shakes out.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.820
We got to go up to the name.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.500
Like go up to the top of that article.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.860
Sass, Sasspocalypse.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.020
Sasspocalypse.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.860
Sasspocalypse again on the 3rd of February 26th.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.480
Yeah, because it's these, you know, there's a link to a Bloomberg article.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.740
What's behind the Sasspocalypse?

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.320
I do not care about your, you know what?

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.180
I'm going to go this way.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:54.480
Unlimited access.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:55.720
There we go.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.700
We'll go into the reader.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:57.800
Yeah.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.900
So, yeah, anyway, you can see like, I'm not sure what.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:03.780
It's a good name, Sasspocalypse.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:04.900
It's a very good name.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.160
I forgot some of the companies.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.540
There are probably ones you wouldn't have heard of.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.080
But, yeah, they opened us up for like a legal specialization.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.360
And then like it broke loose.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.200
I guess hurry up and copy those files.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:18.300
Exactly.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.640
Clone those things before they get banned.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.100
Over to you.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:30.900
Well, you just, your comment about Epstein files reminded me of an extra I saw recently.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:35.800
That the Bash shell manual was part of the Epstein files.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.560
I saw that.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.260
What?

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.380
Bizarre.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.260
Anyway.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.220
Yeah, so bizarre.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.180
There's whatever.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.160
There's a bunch of stuff.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.620
My daughter was telling me some, I don't know if this is true or not.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.740
This is way third hand through a teenager.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:57.120
But that like, that Biden was like a clone or something.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:57.900
Oh, geez.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:58.620
Anyway.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:33:59.340
Okay.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.920
Back to sort of reality.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.560
Rand's man, man.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:11.460
rand's uh michael lopp uh wrote under the name of rand's for a while um has there's a couple i

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.540
just want to point out a couple articles i i found amusing recently or just helpful and interesting

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:24.920
uh rand's article i hate fish um is not really about fish it's about productivity systems and

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.420
also um just sort of a talking about uh productivity systems because i know a lot of people kind of

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:36.120
go down that rabbit hole of um uh of getting things done and whatever uh but there's an

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:41.640
interesting uh interesting discussion around email and i thought the email discussion was uh what was

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:50.960
worth a peruse so uh good writing there he's also just a great author cool and then also um this one

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:59.440
is expertise is the art of ignoring and this is very true this is from kevin renskers and um who

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:09.580
is um apparently open for side work so um you know uh so but um i i'm not going to go through the

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:19.220
whole thing uh near the end he had some uh final thoughts uh let's see um oh here here there are

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:25.300
some lessons you don't need to master the language you need to master your slice which is very important

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:30.620
and that's it that actually used to be we used to talk about python being the language you could fit

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:38.080
in your head all at once and it kind of isn't now um so it's okay that you can't fit it all in there

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:44.960
if you don't really understand comprehensions yet don't worry about it um actually and even if it

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:52.300
you should but even if you could fit the whole language in your head pypi yeah pypi and instead even

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:57.420
the standard library though like i forget uh stuff that's in the standard library all the time so

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:04.440
um and you know you don't need to master your language master your slice and uh build things

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:10.940
um and you'll you'll provide value as you build things uh learn everything up front is wasted effort

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:19.160
again um it knowledge decays fast um learn what the problem demands when it demands it i like to go a

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:24.180
little further obviously i'm kind of like you know how does that work and and uh explore a little bit

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:31.360
further but that's just that's my entertainment so and also expertise changes uh what you pay

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:38.040
attention to so um a senior developers don't necessarily know more facts they're better at

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:44.100
recognizing which details matter right now and which ones don't and that's definitely true i think when i was

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:50.700
all of my years as a a project lead um i think my main skill was the ability to say

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:55.740
yeah it's probably not actually going to happen so let's uh not work on that right now um yeah

00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:03.340
so and why does that matter it's not just oh i probably should ignore that it's that stops you from

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:08.740
going and i'm going to spend two weeks learning that framework or that angle or something and then try

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:14.200
and then decide i don't need it right that's a big deal yeah and actually context the context shift

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:23.200
time is very real and context shift time for uh entire engineers is um is destructive and so um the

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:29.720
more time you can i'm talking to leaders here the more time you can um save individual contributors

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:37.560
from having to shift gears all the time um if you can keep them going like you know hey i need you to

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:43.780
start working on something new uh when are you done with the current thing if it's like less than a

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:51.820
day or a day or so let them finish uh you'll get more productivity that way so 100 okay that's just

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:57.380
just a couple nice articles that's it awesome well you have set the stage perfectly with this context

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:04.820
switching story mental context switching for the joke and this one i feel called out i'm gonna just

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:09.980
tell people i feel called out here so i've entitled this joke silence current side project

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:16.680
oh yeah are you ready yes silence current side project a new side project is talking

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:24.720
oh oh it hurts doesn't it i mean how many people out here listening have like worked on a side project

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:30.620
got it 65 of the way done and like squirrel and they go off and do another thing you get 40 done come

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:36.320
back get distracted you know just silence current side project a new side project is talking

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:46.500
yes uh well uh my existing current book that i'm right writing uh that i need to get back to that i'd

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:53.760
rather spend on my time on a new uh sas project right now even my new projects get subverted by my

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.600
other new projects i'm like stop please this cannot go on that's why i'm so thrilled about getting the

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:06.820
command book app out because it literally went from like zero to documentation published for sale

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:16.360
without me not being able to focus so it's a good deal nice yeah but in the shadow of that experience

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.540
there are many things that are still pending and

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:27.600
awesome uh once again uh lovely to talk to you about python um and catch up thanks everybody for

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:33.520
sending in ideas and keep them coming and yeah we'll talk to you all next week bye everyone
