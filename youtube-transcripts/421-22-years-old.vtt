WEBVTT

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.560
Hey everybody, thanks so much for showing up at the channel. We love having you here.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.260
So let's kick off the show. What do you think?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.500
Let's do it.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.020
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:25.200
to your earbuds. This is episode 421 recorded February 24th. And I'm Brian Otkin.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.900
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.760
This fabulous episode is sponsored by all of you folks that support us at,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.880
like maybe taking a course over at Talk Python Training or heading to

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.280
python test.com. Learn about PI test, maybe take a course.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.500
We also love our Patreon supporters. So thank you.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.000
If you'd like to connect with us, of course you can check,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.800
there's six links in the show notes for the show and me and Michael over at Blue

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.360
Sky or Fosstodon or Mastodon.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360
So keep in track of both of those.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.560
And if you'd ever like to jump into the show live,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.940
you can head to pythonbytes.fm/live

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.660
and check out when the next recording will be

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.280
and you can be with us and ask questions and stuff.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.700
And it's fun.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.440
And finally, the newsletter is still going out

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.140
and Michael's made some improvements to it.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.440
So we're making some neat things.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.680
and I think it's a really cool resource now.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.860
If you are, especially if sometimes you listen to the show

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.300
and you're like, that seems like a cool topic

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.500
but I don't quite know much about that thing

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.420
that they're talking about,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.820
we're including some background information.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.040
So if you'd like to learn more about the topic,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.540
we're including a lot of links

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.700
and that's really pretty cool.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.940
- Yeah, super fun.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.360
- Yeah, speaking of super fun,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.640
what's your first topic for us, Michael?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.680
- You know what is super fun?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.820
Debugging is super fun.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.660
(laughs)

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.480
Because testing is sometimes fun, but debugging,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.320
that's where the mysteries really live.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.180
You never know.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.940
And if you don't do much testing,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.380
you might do more debugging, you never know.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.320
Anyway, I wanna talk about debugging HTTP calls.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.100
Now, one way in which you might do this is you might say,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.380
I have this well-factored piece of code over here,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.720
and I can call this function, and we can, in isolation,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.700
test how it talks to some part, something else in the world, right?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.560
And maybe we'll mock the HTTP later out.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:39.200
We talked about REST, RSPX, which was a cool way to mock out HTTPX and, you know, there's

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.420
VCR and other things like that which you might do.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.320
But this kind of allows you to intercept what's actually happening.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.400
You could use it during tests or you could use it just when your app is running.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.040
All the HTTP calls coming out of your Python app and then gives you a UI for understanding

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.620
them which is pretty darn cool I think.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.560
Okay, so what you do is the thing is called HTTP DBG for debug because those two vowels

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.440
are hard work folks.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.320
So HTTP debug tool is for Python developers

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.180
to easily debug HTTP or HTTPS client requests

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.120
in a Python program.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.160
All you've got to do to use it is,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.920
instead of saying Python my app, you say PyHTTP debug my app,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.120
and it will sort of wrap and mock out all of the stuff.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.000
Mock is maybe not quite the right word

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.320
because it still does the action.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.420
it's sort of put an adapter or an intercepting layer

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.960
on top of all your behaviors, right?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.260
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.460
So you get this UI, and it shows you all the requests

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.220
that your app has made.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.420
And then you can click on them.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.760
You can put them side by side and compare them,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.300
all those kind of stuff, which for the grand total effort

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.320
of pip install and then run your code slightly differently,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.240
but that's a lot of benefit and a lot of visibility into your app.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.240
So if you're doing things like maybe using Postman or something like that

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.320
to kind of test out the calls and you try to replicate it over there and you're like,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.600
"Why is it not quite the same?"

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.320
Well, put this thing on it and see what happens.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.360
Yeah, I can also see this as a learning tool,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.080
where you're just learning how all of this stuff gets put together.

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.639
Like, how does the request get...

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.240
What does the data look like and what's going on here?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.400
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.660
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.300
And the other thing you can do is it--

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.680
it's not just your direct HTTP calls,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.120
like say, HTTPS or requests or something.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.360
If something else, a library you're using,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.760
is then you're calling the API and it's not your library,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.740
you still get visibility into what that thing's doing.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.580
Because it's anything the application does,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.400
not anything that your code does, which is pretty cool.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.080
>> Yeah.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.220
>> So if you're using, say, the Sentry API, and you're like,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.480
why is it failing to talk to this thing?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.560
What is it even doing?

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.700
You just say capture exception, but somewhere along the way,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.620
HTTP request is being done.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.440
So you could intercept that as well, like all the traffic.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.620
I guess if you're like, is my thing spying on me?

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.640
Is this library that I'm using reaching out to something

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.080
that I'm not aware of that's happening?

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.760
You could also catch that theoretically.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.080
But it supports requests, URL lib, HTTPX,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.680
MFAVE these days, aiohttp,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.120
pytest, Unit Test, and your package.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.200
Yes, if you include it.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.180
Anyway, then when you run it,

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.340
you get a web interface that gives you

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.660
some behaviors in the UI.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.840
You can change the strategy to group requests.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.720
You can hide the scheme, the network URL.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.500
You can group rows, tags, all these different things.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.920
So there you have it, folks.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.580
HTTP.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.220
I think you're supposed to just say the initials like HTTP--

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.020
this is hard-- HTTPDBG.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.120
Yeah, that's--

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.620
Yeah, possibly.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.800
OK, something a little easier to pronounce.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.460
PyPI now supports iOS and Android wheels

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.920
for mobile Python development.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.200
This is cool, I think.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.520
- This is very cool, yeah.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.340
- So this is brought to us by Sarah Gooding.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.380
And so the announcement really is,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.020
there's been some work.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.940
Russell Keith-Magee has been a long time advocate

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.000
to try to push this ball forward

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.220
and get Python directly on devices better.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.140
So there's a couple peps, 730 and 738,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.920
to talk about adding iOS and Android

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.780
as a supported platform.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.080
So now, now they are, their wheels are supported there.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.300
So how do we take advantage of this?

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.040
Well, there are some information in the article

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.480
that we're linking to, but also, let's see.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.100
There is, there's some tools that I've heard of,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.860
B-Ware, and we've covered B-Ware and Kibbe before,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.460
And then Chacopee, Chacopee, maybe?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.460
I don't think, I don't know if we've covered that,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.960
but that's another one for Android.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.380
- Yeah, that sounds new to me as well.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.320
I haven't, I don't remember that one.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.800
- So, however, so you can either use these,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.700
but I was curious about like, so for pure Python stuff,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.780
if I wanna be able to like,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.800
if I'm not doing anything too fancy

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.480
and I wanna be able to have it be installable

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.920
on one of these, what would I could possibly do?

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.400
And CI Build Wheel is one of the tools

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.020
that people have used before for other operating systems.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.300
And apparently that's not ready yet,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.900
but it is in the works.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.080
So CI Build Wheel updates are in progress

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.740
to simplify iOS and Android wheel creation.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:18.340
So soon more and more third-party little libraries

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:26.020
Yeah, that's awesome. I'm very excited for this. I think this is, you know, there's two

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:33.240
areas of Python that are very troublesome, right? If someone comes to you and says, "Hey,

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.719
I want to do some programming. What language should I use?" "Python, that's a great one."

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:40.900
Yeah, so I'm looking to build a mobile app like this. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I totally

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:44.900
retract my statement. You can't even, don't do that, is the one. And then the other is,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.760
like Vue, React, other front-end JavaScripty things, right?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.640
And what's cool is that the folks at Anaconda

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.300
are actually really working hard to address both of those.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.400
And part of what we're seeing here is some of the work

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.480
from them I actually had, bumping over this way,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.320
I had Russell Keith McGee on, the guy behind Beware,

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.620
and to talk about the state of Python on mobile,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.120
just YouTube helped me out five days ago.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:16.840
- Wow.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.900
- To talk about this.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.760
And he's been working, employed by Anaconda

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.580
as part of their open source team for a couple years,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.160
solving these problems,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.560
getting him and a guy named Malcolm

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.880
are getting peps to have Python officially be,

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.280
to have iOS and Android an official build target

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.700
of CPython, which is pretty interesting, right?

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.980
Like we expect as part of the core developer process,

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.620
we should be able to build it so that it

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.160
runs on those platforms.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.460
And those peps, I believe, are accepted, but not necessarily

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.040
in yet.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.020
So that's upstreaming a lot of the work that Russell has done.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.480
And they're using CI Build Will to make this happen.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.220
So a lot of interesting stuff happening there.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.000
Yeah.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:04.920
Yeah.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:05.520
Cool.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.880
Yeah, I wasn't planning to talk about that episode.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.560
Since you brought it up, it seems like if you guys are like, wait, what?

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.360
What is all this about?

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.200
You know, listen, I don't know that much,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.080
but Russell gives us the whole rundown last week.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.740
So you can check that out.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.280
Can't wait to listen.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.000
Yeah, definitely.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:22.740
Should be out soon.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.560
OK, no joke.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.340
How about a game, though?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.620
I'm not ready for the joke.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:28.760
I like games.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.800
It popped up in my tab.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:35.020
But the game-- so we got a notification from--

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.280
I can't remember.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:44.140
Oh yes, Mayak Symering, who's working on Arcade, the game platform,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.240
and it hasn't had any major updates for a while,

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.580
until now. They just released 3.0 of Arcade.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.360
So if you are a huge fan of Mario Brothers type of 2D scrolling games,

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.820
or you want to build something like Asteroid, you know, the game from the 70s,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.860
That kind of UI, well this is a really great platform for it.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.000
So what are the changes?

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.500
Breaking changes, but you know, I guess that's expected after a while.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.280
Dropped Python 3.8.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.660
Seems fine after, you know, the world has moved on from there.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.580
But texture management completely changed.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.360
And they used to cache everything.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.520
Apparently it was too much.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.919
But now you can reload and probably things are fast enough

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.700
that you don't need caching.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.120
It works better to keep work in memory.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.440
In the graphics card or something better.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.600
Remove some stuff, fixed arcade context and so on.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.940
But mostly, I want to put this out there

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.460
as if you've been thinking of building a 2D game type of

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.980
thing, and you're like, well, arcade's interesting,

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.500
but it hasn't gotten a lot of love.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.540
Well, now it has, right?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.800
Last update yesterday.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.060
Pretty cool.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.500
You know, actually--

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.160
There's some examples.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.500
Sorry, Brian.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.780
This is some examples you can link to off of the Arcade.academy website.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:05.580
Go ahead.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.400
No, I just, you said it hasn't had a lot of love in a long time, but it's still been,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.860
I mean, I don't know if they needed to fix some things to get it to work on modern Python?

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.320
Yeah.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:15.360
Okay.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.420
Yeah, I'm not sure if they, I don't know that they necessarily did, but it just hasn't had

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.700
any major releases, you know?

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.400
Well, I'm noticing, so I've been doing that Toppytest plugin thing and investigating a

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.740
lot of the plugins, and there's a lot of stuff.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.640
I'm noticing there's a lot of stuff that used to be updated a lot.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.320
And for just to say like in the trove classifiers to say I support,

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.440
you know, three, three, eight, three, nine, three, 10 and then they just sort of

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.780
stop. But, but a lot of, I,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.380
I guess try stuff out because the Python has been pretty stable for a lot of

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.140
things. And it's been, even though we've gotten some really cool things,

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.180
it's still very backwards compatible. So, there's,

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:06.040
There's a lot of old packages that don't say that they work on modern Python, like 3.13 or something, but still do.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.540
So, don't dismiss a package just because it hasn't been updated for a while. Try it out. It might be fine.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:19.440
That's good advice. There's one thing where I can't remember if it was at Rust or some other platform,

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.340
their equivalent of PyPI was they were automatically putting

00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:28.280
security warnings or something like that

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.260
onto packages that had not had git commit

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.060
in two years. But you know it might be done.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.720
There's a thing that could just completely do what it's supposed to do and not

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.460
need to change. Anyway.

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:45.080
Yeah. So you can check out the different kinds of games. I got some

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.379
a bunch of example games that you can play and try out. And they look

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.140
They look pretty cool. If you're looking for a,

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.760
I don't want to use Unreal Engine and go completely down the

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.780
higher team of 100 people to build a game.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:58.860
That's the fun.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.080
That looks pretty cool.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.340
It does look pretty cool.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.160
Yeah.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.880
Yeah, I think it's OpenGL based.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.680
I'm pretty sure. Is that right?

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.860
Yeah, it's built on top of Piglet and OpenGL.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:11.760
Yeah.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.600
So, you can use your graphics card for all sorts of fun stuff.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.260
Yeah.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:23.720
I guess I'm on tangent mode right now. I guess I was thinking about games and a lot of people think I think a lot

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.580
of kids get into

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.999
Like want to get into programming because they think game programming would be fun and

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.160
Game programming is hard

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.080
And I mean there's a lot of programming that's hard, but but became programming

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.740
There's a lot of stuff going on and in it doesn't necessarily

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.059
I just don't get frustrated if you start game programming and it it it's a little difficult

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.600
and there's a lot of programming that's pretty straightforward.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.740
Yeah, I totally agree.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.660
Some of my first programming was 3D simulators in OpenGL,

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.060
and it was not the easiest thing ever, in C++.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.000
Nice.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:03.400
Okay.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:11.059
Well, other things to not do is don't--

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.360
okay, I think I'm going to have too many negatives here.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.580
I just I guess want to announce that pep

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:24.940
765 has been accepted and PEP 765 is to disallow return break and continue

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.980
That exit if finally block that's a lot of

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.700
Terms, so what am I saying?

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.100
It's that there's the keywords return break and continue

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.760
shouldn't show up in a finally block and

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.640
When I first saw this I'm like, why would I do that? Anyway, I just don't I

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.400
usually put pretty simple stuff and finalize and I wouldn't ever think to do it I

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:57.880
Might think to do a return or anyway that the it's just bad and the behavior apparently is surprising

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.400
So, so they really would hope to not have that in there

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:11.060
so apparently this was rejected once before but now it's accepted slightly different there's a

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.920
cost benefit analysis of the change that was done and it will be better for

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.760
everybody if we do this. However, because of some backwards compatibility stuff,

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:29.180
it will not be a syntax error, it will be a syntax warning. So I guess we'll rely on

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:38.660
people running with -WA or having Ruff or Flakade or Pilot or something check this stuff for us.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.440
Basically, don't do it.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.300
Just don't.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.820
It's not good.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:44.680
It's not good.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.980
Yeah, I can sure see return in it finally.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.080
That makes a lot of sense to me.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.900
I'm not sure why return is pulled out.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.620
But like break and continue and other looping,

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.940
I could see why that's all right.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:01.940
Yeah.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.080
Yeah, whatever.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.560
I mean, it's not hard to work around.

00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:11.079
Yeah, so this isn't a big topic, just to be aware.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.260
If you're doing something fancy within your finally blocks,

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.420
pay attention to this.

00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:16.660
Stop.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.439
Stop.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.199
Stop, apparently.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.420
All right, well, we're going to stop with our items, aren't we?

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.439
Yeah, we are.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.160
We got some extras?

00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:25.280
We sure do.

00:17:25.459 --> 00:17:26.140
So exciting.

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:28.060
Let me fire some up.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.480
So remember our teapot episode?

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.100
418, I'm a teapot.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.500
Well, we had our joke about the teapot.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.940
And I think the person who created the joke that we covered

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.560
felt that he didn't get enough love or something like that.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.380
Because we pulled up a post somebody had on Mastodon--

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.520
that's not on Bluesky-- Bluesky, I think, that said, hey,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:52.980
funny joke.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.540
Person shared it.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.020
Well, Nikita says, important correction.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.200
We-- I think it's--

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.180
I created this joke.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.260
So anyway, thank you, Nikita, for creating this joke.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:04.940
It was very funny.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.000
So I'll link to that to give him a little bit of credit.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.360
Next up, Brian--

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.200
Oh, just like a slightly different name.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.780
So Nikita reported it was a joke by Nikki Tonski,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.840
a different person.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:17.600
Oh, different.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.220
OK.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.220
All right, perfect.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.720
Well, thanks for the correction.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.680
So I have something really surprising.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.940
So check this out.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.680
I had a Mac mini M1, the very, very first Apple Silicon

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.200
Mac that came out, the Mac mini.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:40.940
I got it in 2020 and I remember I think we talked about this at the time in 2020

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.160
I'd already ordered the new MacBook Pro which was still the Intel then I saw

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.280
the Apple Silicon stuff come out and I actually canceled it and like reordered

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:54.640
the mini and it was best decision ever well good decision and worked out great

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.700
but it's just been chilling around here I've had my Mac mini m2 pro that's all

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.539
maxed out and it's been laying around I thought you know I'm not doing a lot

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.120
with the other one but I wanted to set it up so I could do easier recording

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.560
and starting to get a little slow but you know what I'll just I'll just live

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.400
with it I don't really need to buy a new mini like I don't need to waste the

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.160
money just for that and then for some reason I start I saw the that Apple

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.000
started having refurbished ones that you could buy and it turns out to not be a

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.700
very good deal it's like hey the refurbished ones like $5.79 the new ones

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:31.419
$5.99 and go away I'll just take the new one but I looked what would my old

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.040
2020 Mac Mini trade in for?

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.340
Well, first of all, how much is a new Mac Mini with the M4, 10 core, 10GB?

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.100
Pretty much the same specs except for the hard drive.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.500
And it's the brand new way, way faster computer.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.740
$599, $600 US.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:49.820
Wow.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.580
My old Mini from five years ago traded in for $425.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:54.840
What?

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.200
So I got a brand new Mac Mini M4 for $175.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.780
I want to point out to anyone else, before any of this stuff changes, you might also

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.380
want to get a new Mini for $175 if you have a five-year-old one.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.420
How awesome is that?

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.440
Yeah, I think mine's only a couple years.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.520
I should check it out.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.140
But it might be worth checking out.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:17.940
And I ran it through Geekbench here.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:28.680
And even against my M2 Pro, which is way faster than my old Mini, this new one that was $175,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:33.000
$40, a lot faster than even the M2 Pro.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.800
Single core is like 40% faster.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.460
Even multi-core is something like 20% faster

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.180
for that little bit of money.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.600
So hey, that's just putting it on the radar.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.760
Y'all might want to check that out.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.600
That's a pretty good trade, in my opinion.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:52.880
Nice.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.520
All right, that's all for my extras.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.580
But yeah, I just thought that that was a really surprising thing.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.340
Like, you know, all right.

00:21:02.419 --> 00:21:02.820
OK.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.420
I have a couple--

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.020
I'll trade the mini.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.440
Couple extras.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.640
Also, I just really love using the mini to record with,

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.120
because it's always silent.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.360
It's always silent.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.380
And it's--

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:14.560
Yeah.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.520
And they're pretty cheap, even to go big.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.280
But so I just went for a bottom end one.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.300
I think I spent $400 on this or something.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:23.520
Ridiculous.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.500
Well, you probably can trade it and get one for like $120.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:26.680
Yeah, maybe.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.020
So I have mentioned before that I'm not a fan of Scheme and Lisp.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.520
And--

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:34.980
Oh, gosh.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:41.220
I guess I just want to hit a nerve for at least one person.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.360
Philip-- and I'm sorry, Philip, I'm

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.800
not going to try to pronounce your last name.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.600
But it looks cool.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.540
Lisiak?

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.140
Something like that?

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.160
OK.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.160
Laziak?

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:51.740
Nice.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.840
I'll probably mess it up, but we'll see.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.280
OK.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.259
But he decided to, and we interacted on the,

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.640
I think Fosterdon or Bluesky or something,

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.000
and just kind of, he said, you know,

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.320
basically, what do you got against it?

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.700
I'm like, I don't have anything against Scheme, really.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.880
I just, personally, me, I didn't find a lot of use for it.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.720
And we talked about it, and I actually wrote up

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.540
this big conversation with him that I need to make

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.579
into a blog post because I do appreciate

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.880
that I learned Scheme, I just haven't used it a lot.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.100
So, and he said, "There's a lot of uses."

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.320
And I said, "I'd love to hear some."

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.400
And he's like, "Oh, okay, well then I'm gonna have

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.360
"to write a blog post."

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.200
So he wrote, "My Land of Scheme" in 2025.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.440
So, we're gonna link to a blog post

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.060
of all the cool stuff that Scheme does lately,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.900
at least from his perspective.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:46.840
So, that's cool.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.900
And then, actually, I really enjoy his writing style.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.720
So I really like good long form blog posts,

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.580
but anyway, good writing style.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.100
Thanks, Phil.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.040
And he also just recently released another article,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.400
"Exposing Flaky Tests with pytest Rerun Failures."

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.540
And it's a plugin that I've used a lot too.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.240
So cool writing.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.280
So keep up the blogs, people.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.260
Like it.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.539
And I'm really sorry if I have offended anybody

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:23.660
that likes Scheme or what else, who else can I offend?

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.840
Pearl Riders, C#.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.480
I just don't enjoy writing C# and Scheme.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.820
It isn't anything against the language.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.380
It's just not for me, so.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.760
- All right, well I can see why it's tough, Brian.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:38.940
I can see why it's tough.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.360
Actually, pulled this joke up when I thought of--

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.560
- I can see why it's tough.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.820
- And I thought of you when I said.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.720
So, question.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.520
This is like you being too logical or you may be a tester.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.700
When I was four, my sister was two.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.100
I am now 44.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.440
How old is my sister?

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.840
Programmer, easy, 44 minus four, but minus two from that.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.700
No, that's two years difference of the gap.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.480
So 42, tester.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.720
Well, you see, this is a tough one.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.279
She might be 42, but she could be 41 or 43 also

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.200
since you didn't say when your birthday is

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.060
and her birthday is.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.180
Also, she could be dead.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.820
Finally, I thought she was your sister.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.700
You might have thought she was your sister,

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.900
but actually your mom had an affair with another man

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.380
and a woman who was one.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.780
And it turns out it's not your sister.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.260
So with that, it'll roll, you know,

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.440
and on and on it goes.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.500
Give it away, your real sister.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.540
You don't know how old she is.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.480
Finally, what if you think your sister is dead,

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.880
but she actually has become an astronaut

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.440
on a secret government project

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.420
and she's been traveling at near light speed.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.060
Now her time is going much more slowly.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.500
She could actually be younger than 41.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.060
You see, it's hard to be a tester, right?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.560
(laughing)

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.080
- Yeah, I like Anthony's answer.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.960
Two is half of four, so.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.980
- Oh my God, hey Anthony, shout out in the audience there.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.960
You are absolutely right.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.100
And if you go to the YouTube,

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.060
the YouTube comments, it's,

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.700
duh, she's 22.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.440
It's that it says, someone else says,

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.680
a fellow McDonald's graduate I see.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.000
Yeah, that was an easy one.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.080
(laughs)

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.080
- Oh, follow up, that's a chat GTP answer,

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.720
ChatGPT answer, last time she was half your age.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.440
- Oh my gosh, okay.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.580
- Oh, and nice inside joke there,

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.980
Anthony making fun of AI since he's pretty much

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.920
an AI pimp these days as far as I remember, but,

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.500
And anyway, the comments are pretty funny as well.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.640
And then someone just responds, green.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:47.520
Green.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.080
Like a test pass.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.140
Awesome.

00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:58.160
Well, great to have people in the audience to chat with and be part of the show.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.840
And Brian, great to be here with you, right?

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.420
It's good to be with you.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.140
Bye.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:03.480
Bye.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:05.340
(bubbling)
