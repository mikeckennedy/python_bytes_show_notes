00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello world. Hello Brian.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's do this, huh?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Yeah.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's talk a little bit of Python news. Thank you everyone for being here on YouTube and we'll kick this off.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is episode 388, recorded June 18th, 2024. I am Michael Kennedy.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And this episode is brought to you by Scout APM.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Check them out. We'll tell you more about them as we get further into the show.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Brian, you, me, the podcast, we're all Fosstodonians and folks who want to come hang out on Mastodon.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Doesn't have to be Fosstodon. Talked about that last week.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's the whole idea of Mastodon.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Go wherever you want, but we're happy to invite you to Fosstodon if you want.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Yeah. Find the links to connect with us over there or even on X these days as well if you wish.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
A lot of people are still just hanging out over there.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And listen, watch, participate live 10 a.m. Pacific time on Tuesdays, typically.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Links in the show notes or on the website.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Finally, if you want a handcrafted, artisanal Brian Okken special summary and set of links of whatever we talk about,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
even if you don't listen to that episode, by the onbytes.fm.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Click on the newsletter, put in your information.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We won't share it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Just want to tell you about what we're up to and keep in touch with you.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So that's pretty awesome.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That list keeps growing and people are enjoying it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So good work on that, Brian.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There is a newsletter.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That's cool.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Yeah. How about that?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Nice.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Yeah.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We also kind of put it under the friends of the show thing, but that's a little more indirect, you know?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Like, okay, you want to sign up for the newsletter, click the newsletter button.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You can sign up for the newsletter even if you don't like us.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
That's fine.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Yeah, that's true.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Yeah, you can just mock the links we put in there every week.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And the show too.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Exactly.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
There probably are, actually.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
All right.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Well, what have you brought today?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
All right.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I want to talk about -- what am I talking about?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'm talking about the PSF election.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So the Python Software Foundation has elections every year.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
In order to vote, we're going to talk about a little bit around what's going on with this.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But I want to highlight that you -- even if you voted last year, you can't just vote again without doing something.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And it's not difficult.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You just have to affirm your membership status.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So we've got a link in the show notes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You just head up.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We'll talk about the dates a little bit.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I think maybe the dates are here.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
No, another link.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We have lots of links for you for this.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But there is the -- what are we doing -- what are we voting on?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We're voting on the new board of directors.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And then there's a few bylaws changes.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So head over to the first link.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Make sure you're either signed up.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So the deadlines are right around the corner.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So it's 25th.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.000
June 25th is when you have to either sign up to be a member or, if you already are, affirm that you're going to vote.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So that's the 25th.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000
The board election, if you go to the board election, there's a blog post called "It's Time to Make Nominations for the PSF Board Election."

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It has the timeline.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
This is a great -- it's got mostly all that I'm talking about here.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Nominations are open.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
They opened on the 11th.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
If you would like to be nominated or nominate somebody, that is up until the 25th of June.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So the 25th of June is the close of board nominations.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
It's also the cutoff date to affirm that you're going to vote or eligible to vote or whatever.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So that's June 25th.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Then we don't know who's in it because the candidate -- it's still open.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Other people might enter.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And there's information in here on, like, what to include because you'll want some information about, like, who you are and stuff like that if you want to nominate yourself.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So the candidates are announced June 27th.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And then voting starts -- voting is from July 2nd to July 16th.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So voting is in July, but we need to get everything ready at the end of June.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So that's what's going on here.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So it's the nominations for the board of directors.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And there's links about what's going on.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Oh, there's one other data I wanted to highlight.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I can't remember where I found this, but there is a -- here it is.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Thinking about running for the board of directors, let's talk.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
There is a June 18th session that you can -- office hours where you can find out more information.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If you're just curious and you'd like to know more, that's a great place to go.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:20.000
There is -- and then -- so it's for the board of directors, and then there's also three bylaw changes proposed.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I think they make sense, but I'm not going to get into the depths of them.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But there's a link here.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Go ahead and check that out about the three things.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
One of the things I'm really kind of excited about is this.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
The first one is merging, contributing, and managing member classes.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And I think that's -- I think it makes sense because I sometimes have forgot which is which, what contributing and managing means.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I think there's text on all of these.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So go ahead.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And there's discussions going on around this, too.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So anyway, elections coming up, make sure that you affirm your voter status if you'd like to vote.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Okay, interesting.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Some of these shed some light on messages I've seen on social media.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Why are people talking about this?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Oh, okay, I see.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Proposed changes, got it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Yeah.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So you know what I would propose, Brian?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
What?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:31.000
If you were working for a company and you were having HR issues, let's say, what would you say exactly you do here?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Bob?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
No.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
If you're having HR issues.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I'm a people person.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I talk to the people.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
The engineers can't talk to the people.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
No, something like that.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Anyway, if you were having issues with work and you got fired and you wanted to give them the big middle finger on the way out,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
one thing I don't recommend is going to all the GitHub repositories and permanently deleting them,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000
or deleting the logs, or then replacing them with code that mocks the existing employees or anything like that.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
There's this character, and boy, he seemed like a piece of work, let me tell you.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Mick Lewis Daniel Brody, a real piece of work, cloud engineer.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I don't know what a cloud engineer is.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I don't know what software developers are.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Anyway, he's a cloud engineer.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
He was sentenced to two years in prison and a restitution of over half a million dollars

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
for wiping the code repositories of his former employer in retaliation to being fired from First Republic Bank.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Wow.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Wow.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Probably some kind of discrimination thing or something.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
He really had a reason to be upset?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
No.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Why was this guy fired?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
The court documents state that Brody's employment was terminated after he violated company policies

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
by connecting a USB drive containing pornography to the company computers.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And then when they tried to get the work computer back,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
after he's done all this stuff to it, deleted all the things and so on,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
he then reported the laptop stolen.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Wouldn't give it back.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Anyway, he may be not having a great time.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
A couple of things he did, he ran a malicious script named dar.sh to wipe the FRB servers,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
deleted git logs and git commit history for that particular script.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Props to him for a little covering of the tracks there with the git history.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
That was clever.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
He figured that out given that he--

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Not too clever.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Exactly.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
You delete the repo and you still get that figured out somehow.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
He accessed the GitHub repositories and deleted hosted code.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
He inserted taunts in the code.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I just thought this was, one, an amusing story.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
A little bit of schadenfreude.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
If you're upset with your company, it is not worth it.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Two years in prison, half a million dollars, just walk away.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Just let it be. It's not worth the revenge.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Anyway, let me leave you with that, huh, Brian?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
What do you think of this? Is this crazy?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I think it is, but one of the things I really--

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
I'm not taking sides here or anything, but something that drives me nuts

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
is a thing that some companies do that say--

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
There's standard non-disclosure agreements for exit interviews.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Some of them are generally, you can't talk about what you worked on

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
at this company for, say, a period of six months or a year or something like that

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
just because you might have proprietary information.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
The thing that drives me nuts is things that say,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
"We're not going to give you any of your severance

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
or a portion of your severance unless you promise

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
to not ever disparage the company forever in the future."

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Things like that are just insidious and a blight on free speech.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
It's disgusting.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I don't like it. I know it's a standard practice, but I don't like it.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I don't like it either. I'm really happy to hear the non-compete stuff

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
getting shot down.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I know it's not the same as NDA, but it's in the same category, I feel like.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Do they do that for people getting fired?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
No, no, no.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
But when you get hired, there's traditionally been a lot of non-competes.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I think it was getting out of control, like bakery workers

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
or something silly like that.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Really stuff that you wouldn't think would be under that purview.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But I believe that that got federally shot down,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
or is it just California? I can't remember.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But yeah, anyway.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Maybe this kind of stuff you're talking about, Bill, as well.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
But I don't have a ton of sympathy for this character.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Reminds me a little bit of the guy who took down

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
all the JavaScript folks with the npm left pad

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and then later was arrested for making bombs.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It's like, "Oh, there's that theme here, I see."

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Yeah, not good.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the same person.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
There's definitely a person with the same name in the same area.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Okay.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
You know what is awesome and is not going to get you into trouble?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Scout APM. Let's talk about it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Let me tell you real quick about Scout APM.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
They're big supporters of Python Bytes, so we appreciate that very much.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So if you are tired of spending hours

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
trying to find the root cause of issues impacting your performance,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
then you owe it to yourself to check out Scout APM.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
They're a leading Python application performance monitoring tool, APM,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that helps you identify and solve performance abnormalities faster and easier.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Scout APM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
slow database queries, background jobs,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and the dreaded N+1 queries that you can end up

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
if you do lazy loading in your ORM,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and then you say, "Oh, no. Why is it so slow?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Why are you doing 200 database queries for what should be one?"

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So you can find out things like that.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And it links it back directly to source code,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
so you can spend less time in the debugger and peeling logs

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and just finding the problems and moving on.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And you'll love it because it's built for developers by developers.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It makes it easy to get set up.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Seriously, you can do it in less than four minutes, so that's awesome.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And the best part is the pricing is straightforward.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
You only pay for the data that you use with no hidden overage fees

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
or per-seat pricing.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And I just learned this, Brian.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
They also have--they provide the pro version for free to all open-source projects.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
So if you're an open-source maintainer

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and you want to have Scout APM for that project,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
just shoot them a message or something on their pricing page about that.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So you can start your free trial and get instant insights today.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Visit bythembytes.fm/scout.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
The link is in your podcast player show notes as well.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And please use that link.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Don't just search for them because otherwise they don't think you came from us.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And then they'd stop supporting the show.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
So please use our link bythembytes.fm/scout.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Check them out.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
It really supports the show.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Indeed.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Brian, what's your second one?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I'd like to talk about imports right now.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So import is importing a package.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Is this like tariffs and stuff?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
What are we talking?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
No, no, no.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Importing code into your own code.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
So imports are normally difficult.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
You just say import and the package name you want to import.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
No, no, no.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
The package has to be installed already or a standard library thing, of course,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
like import whole math or something.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I'm blanking right now.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
It's terrible.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
But there is a blog post called Adam Johnson,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
which is talking about like what if you don't want to just use the import?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
You want to import it as an object or something.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And let's say you have a string to describe the package that you want to

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
import.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000
There's a thing called that I didn't know about called packageutil.resolvename.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And this is actually pretty cool.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So what you do is it's in packageutil as part of the standard library.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And you say packageutil.resolvename.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And then you give it a string.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And it's like a package name that is also something that's installed or

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
something in it, like a top-level item.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Like the example is pathlib and capital path, the path object.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
But I tried it on one of my own projects of just like let's say I've got

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
some third-party code that I want to import just something from it.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
But I don't want to import it into the namespace.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I want to just import one thing out of there into an object.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And this is really cool.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
The whole thing resolves and it's from a string.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So you give it a string with this colon in the middle and it creates it.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
You've got an object.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Why is this helpful?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Well, I don't know how other people are using it, but I'm using it for

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
things like testing and stuff that I don't want to like clutter the entire

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
namespace.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I just want one object from something.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So there's that.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Now, there's a note here that says the thing that you're importing can be

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
a class from the package or a function or a module or really any top-level

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
thing, object within the package.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
You can just resolve that and bring it in.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
If you're going to grab the whole module, you can also use importlib.import

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
module, of course.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
You can use that as well to import a thing.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And it's a little bit different syntax.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
You just give it the name of the package.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So there was a note at the top that says Django and some other frameworks

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
allow you to do things like this, to configure something based on a string.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And anyway, I think this is pretty cool.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
One of the places where I'm considering -- yeah, anyway, I've got lots of

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
places and tests that I'm considering using this.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
But I guess I didn't know about it.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
It's pretty neat.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
>> Yeah, one area that might be useful that comes to mind outside of testing

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
or in addition to testing would be some kind of plug-in extension system.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So you say any package that gets listed in this JSON file, we want it to be

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
available.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And if you configure the app, it'll actually import it and use it.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
But it might not import them.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
The app doesn't know about them.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
That can't be coded into it.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So you could just sort of parse that thing, try it, or even scan all the

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
packages somehow and see if they exist or whatever.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
So some sort of dynamic thing like that as well.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
>> Yeah.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Yeah.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Pulling doc strings out of a bunch of stuff too.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Doing a list of that might be fun.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
>> Yeah, nice.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
>> Anyway, lots of stuff you could do.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
>> You sure could.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
>> Now, this last item for me here comes from Alex Monahan.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Just gave us a shout-out and said, "You know that DuckDB thing?"

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:35.000
DuckDB is a little bit like SQLite-ish type stuff, in process based on files

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
rather than separate servers, all those sort of things.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Well, that thing's getting some traction.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Up to 4 million downloads a month off of PyPI.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000
The news is it's released version 1.0 of DuckDB.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And by the way, the cloud-hosted product, MotherDuck, also opened up

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
general availability.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
But the news is the announcing a 1.0.0.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And it's interesting, there's a lot of conversations like, "Well, we could've

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
just called it 1.0 as soon as we made it public on GitHub 10 years ago," or

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
whatever it was, or not quite 10 years ago, 8 years ago.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But the focus is really on, we want to make it super clear, they want to make

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
it super clear that they're focused on stability.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
What's here is kind of what's going to stay.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So, examples that they give, as that thing has evolved, as DuckDB has evolved,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
they've changed the file format around.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
They've created incompatibilities from different versions.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And so, for example, they're now committing to more stable back-and-forth

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
stability on the file system and things like that.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:59.000
So, very cool if you're looking for an interesting SQL-like database to include

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
into your projects.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
This one is quite popular, 20,000 stars.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
It's a very analytical and process database, rather than relational database.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Focused, right?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
You can do cool stuff like integrate it with Pandas and other things like that,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
which is pretty cool.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
For example, select star from a Parquet file or a CSV file and so on.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So, not meant to replace SQLite, but that's kind of the mental model people

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
should have, but more on data science.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Select star from a CSV file, that sounds fun.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And, by the way, this guy Alex, Alex Monahan, is in the audience,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
says here's a backwards compatibility for the files, so you can just leave

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
those files around and not have to manage the upgrades of them and so on.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Which is especially tricky if they're just local files associated with an app,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
rather than a single server that all the apps talk to,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
and you have to manage that one thing through an API.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Yeah, pretty cool.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Cool.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
All right, thanks for sending that in, Alex, and good job, DuckDB folks.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Ryan, what else you got?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
I've got a couple extras.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
What's here?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
One of the extras that I wanted to talk about was just, I guess,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
a shout out to everybody that sends us topics.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
We really appreciate it.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
We appreciate hearing what's new.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Don't assume that we've heard about it just because we do pay attention

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
to a lot of stuff, but there's a lot to pay attention to.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
So if you think it's important, let us know.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Yeah, Brian, I would say a lot of times people start messages like,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
"I'm sure you've heard of this," and we're like, "I have no idea what this is."

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
No.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
"I'm sure we have not heard of this.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I'm sure we have not covered it either."

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
But also it helps if like three or four people send in to say,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
"This is exciting," then that also helps us know that it is exciting.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Yeah, it's pretty much guaranteed to be in on the show.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
You can send it in any time, but the one request is if it's timely

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
and it really needs to go in this week, if it shows up at all,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
try to send it before Tuesday because sometimes we already have our topics.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
That's right.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Yes.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
So right after Tuesday.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
A Wednesday is a fantastic day for recommendations.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
[Laughter]

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Really, any time is great for me.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
But anyway, so a couple new 2.0 releases I just wanted to shout out.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
We talked about this last week, but NumPy 2.0 is out now, so NumPy 2.0.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And on the Scientific Python blog, there's a discussion about it,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
so you can read up on all the NumPy 2.0.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
And this is kind of exciting.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
I just heard about this yesterday, HTMX 2.0.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Oh, you have my attention.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000
So I haven't read any of this, but there's major changes, and we'll see.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I'm not sure what broke or why the 2.0.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
I'm not sure I can switch to this.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
This release ends the support for Internet Explorer.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Oh, my gosh.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Just kidding.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
[Laughter]

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
The interesting bit about this, though, is they're not marking 2.0 as the latest

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000
on npm until January of 2025, because they'd like to have everybody

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
have a smooth transition to there.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Any extras on your side?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
A few.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
First of all, partnered with the folks over at PyCharm,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
and now if you are taking a course at DocPython Training,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
you can get six months of PyCharm Pro for free.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
That even works for our free courses.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
So if you just come over and take a course, sign up, and check that out.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Only works for new accounts at JetBrains.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
It doesn't work for renewals, so I can't.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
This is the best I can do, folks, but it's still pretty awesome

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
to be able to get a good chunk of the users free access to PyCharm Pro.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Also, other item is we have a awesome new course on data science

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
coming to DocPython.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Its release is imminent.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
It awaits a marketing landing page, basically, and then it's out.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
So we have a new course called Reactive Web Dashboards with Shiny.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Shiny for Python, not shiny for R.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
So partnered with the Posit folks to put this course together,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
and it's super cool to build interactive dashboards and web apps

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
for your data science things with Shiny.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Shiny new course.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Very cool.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Indeed.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
It's a shiny brand new course.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
All right.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
It will be shiny for a while.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
How about a joke?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Are you up for it?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Yes.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Okay.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
So we all -- you know you're sitting around, you're in a relationship,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
you have these thoughts that just kind of run through your head,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
and you're always saying, "Oh, no."

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
So here's a young couple laying in bed.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
The woman is thinking, "I bet he's thinking about another woman."

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
And that guy is just laying there, "What would happen if I added

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
gitignore into the gitignore file?"

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
She's giving him way too much credit.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
What would happen?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I know the title is "I Can't Ignore the Gitignore."

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
What would happen if I added the gitignore to the gitignore file?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
No.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Well, there's the joke.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
This is what I got for you, Brian, this week.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I don't know what to tell you.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Now I've got to try it to see --

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Exactly.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
If you do that, you might take GitHub down.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
I don't know if I'd check that in.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Well, not GitHub.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
I mean, it has automation.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
It could explode.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
It could.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Dependabot will just stop working for everyone after that.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Yeah.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
All right.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
All right, well, that's it.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Well, everyone, thank you for listening.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Scout APM, thank you for supporting the show.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And, Brian, thanks as always.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Thank you.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Yep.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Bye.
