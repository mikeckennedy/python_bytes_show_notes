00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey, everybody. Hey, Michael. Good to see you again.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Well, it's exciting news, as always, this week.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>And I'm glad I'm inside because it's kind of rainy outside.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 2>We have a Category 5 atmospheric river. That's not good.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, we're up an atmospheric river without a paddle.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>We are.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>All right. Let's get started.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.460
<v Speaker 1>This is episode 461, recorded December 9th, 2025.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 2>And I am Michael Kennedy.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>And this episode is sponsored by yours truly and Michael.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>So both of us.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Talk Python training.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Always some great stuff.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>I just finished the AI, the recent AI agent course.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh, you did?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh, thank you.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:04.559
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, awesome.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Really enjoyed it.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Some great content there.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.820
<v Speaker 1>But there's plenty of other stuff to do.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>There's even a pytest course there.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.600
<v Speaker 1>But if you'd like a really complete pytest course, head on over to pythontest.com.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>There's the complete course there.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to Patreon supporters.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>also there's a new book out from Michael

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 1>and a book that I'm working on

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>so lots of ways you can support us

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.220
<v Speaker 1>if you just want to support us by sending us topics

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>we'd like that too

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.160
<v Speaker 1>you can connect with us

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.340
<v Speaker 1>there's a contact form on the website

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>on pythonbice.fm

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 1>or you can reach us on Bluesky or Mastodon

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 1>and if you'd like to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.239
<v Speaker 1>we love you

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>But we also would like you to check out our video stuff every once in a while.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Head on over to pythonbytes.fm/live, and you can be part of the audience or just watch it afterwards.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.220
<v Speaker 1>And finally, please subscribe to our newsletter.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Or essentially, it's occasionally we send out little news bits, but mostly it's the show notes from the show.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>So we send out, after we get it all done, we send out a newsletter that has all the links.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to take notes while you're listening.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Now, for our first topic, Michael.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Our first topic is going to be, let's switch.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Our first topic is going to be a tour of peps,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.360
<v Speaker 2>a brand new  PEP in a  PEP that we spent a fair amount of time talking about.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 2>The first one is  PEP 798, unpacking in comprehensions.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 2>So this one is a little bit funky.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 2>It's currently in draft stage targeting Python 3.15.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.540
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty minor, but I think it brings some consistency to it.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 2>So I linked to the conversation here.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:14.000
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is right now if I have a function that takes an arbitrary number of positional keywords,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.160
<v Speaker 2>you would say star args, right?

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Star args, star kwargs is like a pretty common theme that we see.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.700
<v Speaker 2>So if I had something that said star args,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.900
<v Speaker 2>and I wanted to push a tuple of values as those positional parameters,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>I would say star tuple in the function call.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like you say star star for a dictionary to say keyword arguments, right?

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.900
<v Speaker 2>So the idea here is that that works for function calls,

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.160
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't work for comprehensions,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.960
<v Speaker 2>less comprehensions, set comprehensions, and so on,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.960
<v Speaker 2>if you have an iterable.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Right now what we have, and this is super confusing to me,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I always get the order wrong,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.220
<v Speaker 2>or at least I'm always uncertain of the order,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 2>is I can say basically x for x in y,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.440
<v Speaker 2>y for y in thing if I've got a set of lists or intervals and I want to turn them into

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.519
<v Speaker 2>like one big list as a comprehension you can basically do like a double comprehension

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.760
<v Speaker 2>in one thing and I'm always like which one is the collection and which one is the item you know

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:37.119
<v Speaker 2>so this kind of solves that it says you can just say in the comparison you say star iterable for

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 2>or iterable in some list of iterables.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.040
<v Speaker 2>And it makes it real simple.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.380
<v Speaker 2>So you can do that for--

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 2>let's see, I pulled up official pep.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 2>You can do it for list comprehensions, set

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.380
<v Speaker 2>comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.520
<v Speaker 2>If you have an iterable of dictionaries,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>you can create a dictionary comprehension.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.480
<v Speaker 2>And you can do it for generators.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.500
<v Speaker 2>if your generator generates iterables.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty much it.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.020
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.800
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's not something you do now?

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.440
<v Speaker 1>This is a proposal?

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes, this is a draft for 315.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 2>And just a shout-out for a little bit of credit.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.060
<v Speaker 2>This is Adam Hartz and Eric Demain for the people proposing it.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.600
<v Speaker 2>The sponsor is Yale Jalastra.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Sorry if I messed that up.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.540
<v Speaker 2>I gave you my best shot, folks.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 2>So anyway, that's my main topic here for this first one

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.980
<v Speaker 2>is this unpacking in comprehensions.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 2>We've had unpacking in other places into variables.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.440
<v Speaker 2>We've had unpacking into function calls.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 2>We have not had them in comprehensions.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.260
<v Speaker 2>And honestly, this double comprehension,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 2>like double-layered comprehension thing

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.560
<v Speaker 2>has always been complicated.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.060
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm here for it.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean, it does add another thing to language,

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.580
<v Speaker 2>and everything you add to a language just makes it more complicated.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.940
<v Speaker 2>But in this case, I think it's well worth it.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Now, one other...

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I just wanted to say, speaking of the unpacking,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.760
<v Speaker 1>use the star or asterisk,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.180
<v Speaker 1>but one of my favorite names for that character is Splat.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Splat.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Splat.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Let's call them splatted comprehensions.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Here, hold on.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll just edit this, and we'll fix this real quick.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to change the, you know what?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.020
<v Speaker 2>My screen is too small.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I was going to edit the text, right?

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 2>OK, so that's all good.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Now, the next one is just a really quick follow-up on a  PEP as well

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 2>before we move off of Focus on Me.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Remember how excited you were and I was about explicit lazy imports,

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 2>as in lazy dot, dot, dot?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to take it out?

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.320
<v Speaker 2>No. Dear PEP 810 authors, Barry Warsaw writes,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 2>this steering council is happy, happy to unanimously accept PEP 810 explicit lazy imports.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations. You now have a job to implement.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. The same is true for all the other alternative keywords we come up with.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.720
<v Speaker 2>So lazy it is. I know. That's anyway, a little bit of background on some of the thinking the steering council put out there.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.960
<v Speaker 2>But yeah, unanimously and happy.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Yay.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Good.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 2>So happy to see that.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 2>And by the way, just a little shout out for the live stream folks.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have Barry Warsaw and a bunch of other folks on to do a year in review.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Three hours, two hours and 40 minutes from now on Talk Python.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 2>So that's going to be fun.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 2>We'll hear from Barry over there, but probably not about the pep.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 2>All right, over to you, Brian.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.240
<v Speaker 1>uh what am i talking about i'm going to talk about um uh another so another new release

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:15.100
<v Speaker 1>or an upcoming release pandas 3.0 so the pandas 3.0.0 so 300 there's a release candidate zero

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>that's been out since what sometime last week um but there's uh and then apparently there's going

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.280
<v Speaker 1>to be an official 3.0 released in a few weeks but that was a week ago so maybe a couple weeks from

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.680
<v Speaker 1>now? Not sure. So what do we got in here? I'm pretty excited about this, actually. We've got

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:40.620
<v Speaker 1>what's new. There's a dedicated string data type by default. And this is just kind of great. So

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.300
<v Speaker 1>if normally in things that with strings in them, they would show up as objects, but clearly they're

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:54.719
<v Speaker 1>strings. So there's a new string type. And it does change things a bit. If you have any missing

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>things, it'll be an

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:57.760
<v Speaker 1>N-A-N

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>sentinel to say that there's nothing there.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.720
<v Speaker 1>What's great about this is

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.700
<v Speaker 1>if this, once you have

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.340
<v Speaker 1>this str type, D-type

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.080
<v Speaker 1>or str D-type,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.700
<v Speaker 1>you can only put strings or

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.460
<v Speaker 1>N-A-Ns in it. There's nothing else

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.120
<v Speaker 1>allowed.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Nothing weird shows up.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a generic object.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of other implications around

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.080
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.700
<v Speaker 1>The str can only hold strings

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.200
<v Speaker 1>and the Sentinel, of course.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.000
<v Speaker 1>The missing values are Sentinel inferred by default for string data.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Anyway, check out the PEP 14 to get a little more information.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.420
<v Speaker 1>There is other implications around this,

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.720
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's a really good thing.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Copy on write also is kind of a really exciting thing

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.420
<v Speaker 1>that hopefully nobody will really notice.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:56.080
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is really anything that results in an indexing operation

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.360
<v Speaker 1>will return essentially a copy of things.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.480
<v Speaker 1>So you don't, there's not, or not a copy, it'll be a reference.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 1>And it only makes a copy of actually modify something.

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:13.400
<v Speaker 1>So Pandas will keep track of whether or not you've changed it.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.760
<v Speaker 1>And if you haven't changed it, it's just a copy of the data there.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.800
<v Speaker 1>This should save a lot of time and space.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I think that's going to save a ton, especially memory.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Because if I remember correctly,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a pandas expert by any stretch of the imagination,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.320
<v Speaker 2>but when you call operations like filter operations

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.560
<v Speaker 2>or other transform operations, it doesn't in-place modify.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.020
<v Speaker 2>It returns a new data frame.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Like if I add a column to a data frame with the operation,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.300
<v Speaker 2>I get an entire copy of that data frame plus the column,

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.560
<v Speaker 2>one of the new columns.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.740
<v Speaker 2>And if you've got 5 million rows loaded and you call those 5 or 10 times, you're all of a sudden, it's piling up fast.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, and it says the main goal is to change the user API to be more consistent and predictable.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is right.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Because we're doing matrix operations and stuff.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:11.720
<v Speaker 1>And we'd really like it to be kind of like math, where you don't really care about the size or timing implications.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.360
<v Speaker 1>You're just, this is what I want to do.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.780
<v Speaker 1>And having that be more consistent and hidden behind the scenes.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be great.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.400
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make this a lot easier to learn.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.100
<v Speaker 1>They're cleaning up a lot of the API and stuff.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.400
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.660
<v Speaker 1>We had covered this in one of the other episodes that was coming.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.920
<v Speaker 1>PD call syntax can now be used in data frame assign and location.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.520
<v Speaker 1>And this idea is that basically you could just say,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to assign a new column with the addition of two other columns or something,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.920
<v Speaker 1>or some operation.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.680
<v Speaker 1>And it just does it right there.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Like instead of having to do a Lambda expression inside,

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.160
<v Speaker 1>you can just do the expression.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.980
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of a great syntax.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.680
<v Speaker 1>We've got a copy of the syntax in the show notes,

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.360
<v Speaker 1>but that's pretty great.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Some changes to deprecation policy,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.320
<v Speaker 1>probably because of some of these changes that, you know,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.300
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a three-stage deprecation thing.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.760
<v Speaker 1>But I think this is good.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that basically open source projects are being used more.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:22.980
<v Speaker 1>The ones that have to think about this, how to keep track, keep it fun to maintain, but also moving with the times.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think these are good calls.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.420
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of other enhancements as well, so check those out.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.760
<v Speaker 1>But I think this is a really good direction.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to see 3.0 pandas come out.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:32.900
<v Speaker 1>This will be great.

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, that's pretty exciting.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty major change.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.480
<v Speaker 2>All right.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:41.880
<v Speaker 2>What's up next?

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.000
<v Speaker 2>This episode has typos in it, Brian.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh, no.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to fix it.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I know.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Well, remember I spoke about code spell, all one word, code spell,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.600
<v Speaker 2>and it was a misspelling finder, not a spell checker.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.860
<v Speaker 2>The spell checker looks for words that it knows are good

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.040
<v Speaker 2>and says, I don't know that word.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:04.940
<v Speaker 2>That must be misspelled.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.600
<v Speaker 2>In programming, obviously, there's all these symbols

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of stuff.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:17.900
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that drives me crazy is when my editor suggests that a library that I'm importing is misspelled,

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.300
<v Speaker 2>but it's the library's name correctly.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm like, hmm, well, I can't write it any other way.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.140
<v Speaker 3>This is the only way it works.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry, spellchecker, but do I really got to go through and tell you that this is the name of the library I'm using?

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes, apparently I do.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 2>So this like code spell, this thing called typos, also looks for known misspellings like ADN for a common misspelling of AND and so on.

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:46.080
<v Speaker 3>So why are we back?

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Well, Sky Cosco wrote and said, code spell is cool, but you should check out typos.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.180
<v Speaker 2>So typos, I believe it is written in Rust.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes, 99.9%.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.280
<v Speaker 2>That's three nines Rust.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.840
<v Speaker 2>and 0.0% Python, but it's still mentioned.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.160
<v Speaker 2>So it must be less than 1 tenth of 1%.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.440
<v Speaker 2>But it's a little more full-featured for people that like this.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.580
<v Speaker 2>So, for example, it has a GitHub action

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.260
<v Speaker 2>that you could just put into all of your PRs.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.280
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of cool, if you want.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like a gated thing for PRs and commits and so on.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.300
<v Speaker 2>But the best thing about it, I guess two things.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.359
<v Speaker 2>One is it uses the concrete syntax tree

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.760
<v Speaker 2>rather than actually just searching text.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 2>So what it can do is it can find partial bits of words that are misspelled.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is actually not related to that, but it does find partial misspellings.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.980
<v Speaker 2>So, for example, if you write connecton string instead of connection string with snake casing,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever, it says, hey, guess what?

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.860
<v Speaker 2>The word connection and connection underscore string without the I is a misspell.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you should change Connectton to Connectshun or Connectdoor or whatever.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 2>And it gives you a nice little UI for that.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.680
<v Speaker 2>So that's one.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I really like that.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Actually, that's super cool that it can detect misspellings within snake case words.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, yeah.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.140
<v Speaker 2>This is a big improvement.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.940
<v Speaker 2>And PyCharm does this as well, by the way, which is really nice.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.020
<v Speaker 2>But I believe PyCharm is a spell checker, not a misspelling finder or whatever.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Anyway, this is really nice that it does this.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that's super cool, and this is why Sky wrote to us,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:40.560
<v Speaker 2>is it actually has a VS Code in Friends extension in Language Server.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.060
<v Speaker 2>So what you can do is basically install this as an extension in VS Code,

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:51.840
<v Speaker 2>or Cursor, or Google Antigravity, or, you know, WinServ.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.920
<v Speaker 2>You name all the others, right?

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.920
<v Speaker 2>because it's also in the open VSX registry.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.480
<v Speaker 2>So you can install that there.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 2>And then just as you're writing code,

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.600
<v Speaker 2>you get little squigglies and you get alt enter actions to fix it.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.620
<v Speaker 2>So you don't even have to run the client or the GitHub thing and so on,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.200
<v Speaker 2>which the code spell has no editor integration.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's really the fact that this is like that, a little better,

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.540
<v Speaker 2>runs in editors.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.300
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't remember the last time I actually ran a spell checker independently.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I just rely on those in-editor things.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 2>So do I.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:31.680
<v Speaker 2>So do I.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.200
<v Speaker 2>So, yeah, it's also got the LSP for other things, I guess.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, that means you can even use it in NeoVim or Vim or Zed or whatever, right?

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.300
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just even the extensions.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 2>It's actually because the LSP, it even goes farther than that.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Cool.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, anyway.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:59.640
<v Speaker 2>thank you sky for the follow-up and good suggestion all right i uh apparently i'm missing um missing

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:05.640
<v Speaker 1>having a testing podcast so i've got uh two topics that i'd like to talk about a couple of testing

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:13.000
<v Speaker 1>topics um first one came in it's called slow la fi came in from brian skin so thank you uh brian for

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:22.660
<v Speaker 1>for sending in this idea so here's an interesting idea so this is a this is a a project

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:30.840
<v Speaker 1>to simulate overloaded slow resource constrained machines so basically to make your tests flakier

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:40.019
<v Speaker 1>or something nice flaky tests uh but the that but the idea around it is a test is working fine

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.620
<v Speaker 1>in locally, but you throw it up in CI and it fails for some reason.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:51.820
<v Speaker 1>So it might be because you've got a CI image that is more constrained.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.740
<v Speaker 1>So this allows you to do things like muck with how much memory is around

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 1>and how many CPUs are available and stuff.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It does require you to run it on a Linux machine with Cgroups V2 around

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.760
<v Speaker 1>because that's how it throttles the CPU and memory and stuff.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.620
<v Speaker 1>But it shouldn't be hard to come by, hopefully.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:24.020
<v Speaker 1>And yeah, then you can check to muck with things to find out,

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 1>to try to simulate locally a failure that's happening in CI.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.460
<v Speaker 1>So really nice there.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:36.860
<v Speaker 1>The other topic I'd like to talk about testing-related is this comes from Ned Batchelder.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Actually, it's his article.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.340
<v Speaker 1>why your mock breaks later.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.820
<v Speaker 1>And actually, I think it should be stronger than this.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Basically, the don'ts and do's of mocking.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.400
<v Speaker 1>And the gist of it is overly aggressive mocks

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.820
<v Speaker 1>can work fine at first, but then break later.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Recently, a lot of people were doing all this pop down.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're reading a file

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.160
<v Speaker 1>and you want to when the file gets opened,

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't really actually want to muck with the file.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.600
<v Speaker 1>You want to be able to mock that or patch it.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.740
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that some people do

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.420
<v Speaker 1>is to patch the open function.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.680
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways people do it

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.680
<v Speaker 1>is patching built-ins open.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.980
<v Speaker 1>This is not how you want to do it.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.180
<v Speaker 1>This is the don't do this version.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.920
<v Speaker 1>And I'll just zoom in a bit.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Don't do the built-ins open

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.500
<v Speaker 1>because it patches everything.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.320
<v Speaker 1>And it was causing problems in coverage

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.460
<v Speaker 1>because coverage also wants to open something.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And you're basically patching open

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.460
<v Speaker 1>for everything in your program,

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.260
<v Speaker 1>including coverage when it's running on top of it.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to do that.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.040
<v Speaker 1>You only want to patch where you are.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.160
<v Speaker 1>So the proper way is wherever,

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.380
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in a,

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.620
<v Speaker 1>the example is you've got a user

00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:11.640
<v Speaker 1>file you want to patch right there in myproduct.user the dot following of where right exactly where

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:20.520
<v Speaker 1>it is um there's that's the gist of it is don't uh don't mock the thing you're importing

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:27.220
<v Speaker 1>after you've imported it mock it there and uh it's a good good lesson i didn't think that this

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was fairly widely known,

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.800
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't realize it was an issue.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:40.420
<v Speaker 1>He went ahead and did a search for Python in GitHub.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.800
<v Speaker 1>You can search for built-ins open with tests in there

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 1>and patches and stuff, either patches or whatever,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.780
<v Speaker 1>monkey patching or patching or mock patching.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.100
<v Speaker 1>found 44,000 files that were doing the bad one within GitHub.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.640
<v Speaker 1>So this is all naughty.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what kind of GitHub badge you get for 44,000 PRs getting accepted,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.220
<v Speaker 2>but Ned's got himself a real opportunity here to get a 1% total badge.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he wants to fix them all, but yeah.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.080
<v Speaker 2>No, that's an interesting way, an interesting metric.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, and actually at the end of the article,

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:29.140
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like to point out, he talks about some mocking practices.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you use autospec equals true to make sure that your mocks strictly behave like the original.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I wholeheartedly agree with that.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Make assertions about how your mock is called.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Actually, the rest of this is stuff that I actually want to go check out

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.480
<v Speaker 1>because I do remember this functional core imperative shell talk

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.900
<v Speaker 1>and some of these other things, dependency injection.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if I agree with all of Ned's stuff, but that's all right.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Some other interesting things to read about with mocking.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.940
<v Speaker 1>I imagine he knows more than I do because I don't usually mock.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't mock very much.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not very nice to do, honestly.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:06.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not very nice.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.240
<v Speaker 1>To mock people.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, but sometimes it's necessary.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.380
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it's necessary.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.460
<v Speaker 2>You know what is nice, though?

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Extras.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Extras, yeah.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, I do have extras.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Should I go ahead and run through them?

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:20.760
<v Speaker 1>All right.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.940
<v Speaker 1>So I've already got my stuff up.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.000
<v Speaker 1>This is a great,

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:28.860
<v Speaker 1>there was a great mini documentary of FastAPI,

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 1>the rise and fall,

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.100
<v Speaker 1>rise and rise,

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.940
<v Speaker 1>not the rise and fall,

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.280
<v Speaker 1>the rise and rise of FastAPI with Sebastian Ramirez.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's like an eight minute video.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a really fun video of him talking about it.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.200
<v Speaker 1>He's such a genuine,

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.200
<v Speaker 1>nice dude also.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, he really is.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I am still writing Lean TDD, the e-book in progress.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.580
<v Speaker 1>We go to the table of content.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I made a couple of changes.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.660
<v Speaker 1>So somebody requested that not only do I,

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.740
<v Speaker 1>when I release a new chapter to release the full thing,

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.700
<v Speaker 1>but also the latest one.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.240
<v Speaker 1>And that way people can just like,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.860
<v Speaker 1>just throw the latest one on their Kindle

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.000
<v Speaker 1>and just have one chapter.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.179
<v Speaker 1>Or they can either replace the whole thing

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.580
<v Speaker 1>or if they've taken notes on other stuff to just do the updates, the new chapters.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.860
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to do that now, or at least I've started.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.320
<v Speaker 1>We'll see. It's a little extra work, but that's all right.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I got the building on Lean done, and it was long enough to talk about Lean, I think,

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.300
<v Speaker 1>that it made sense to split it.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And I was going to do finding waste in test-driven development as part of that chapter,

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.040
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to make it its own chapter now.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.540
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to do that.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do a sneak peek.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh, never mind.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Of the table of contents in progress so far.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So I'm making some good progress.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I've got an outline for where I'm going in the future.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Where are we now?

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.160
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do Finding Waste and TDD next year.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's not going to be a huge book.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:14.080
<v Speaker 1>So right now we're up to, what, 30 pages as a PDF.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing it will be under 100 pages when I'm done.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a huge book.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not expensive.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.080
<v Speaker 1>It's $10.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:27.100
<v Speaker 2>At least my experience is PDFs usually have more content per page

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.460
<v Speaker 2>than e-books, at least if you ask Amazon how many pages is it.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, and even like way more.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, it's more content per page for e-book,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.600
<v Speaker 1>but also per print book.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.440
<v Speaker 1>So print book isn't usually an 8.5 by 13 page.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:42.160
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Last one, my extra Python 314.2.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.740
<v Speaker 1>was released December 5th.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.580
<v Speaker 1>We haven't had 3.14

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.900
<v Speaker 1>around for that long, but

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.240
<v Speaker 1>people are upgrading, which is great.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.480
<v Speaker 1>And they're not afraid to upgrade, but they're

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.060
<v Speaker 1>finding a few things. So there were a few,

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.880
<v Speaker 1>a handful of fixes. There were

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.400
<v Speaker 1>some exceptions in multiprocessing.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't notice those, but

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.680
<v Speaker 1>some people noticed them.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Data classes without inits were throwing

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.980
<v Speaker 1>exceptions. Anyway, they fixed

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.980
<v Speaker 1>some critical things in 3.14,

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.299
<v Speaker 1>and I appreciate the core

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.820
<v Speaker 1>team being on top of it. So that's great. Yeah. Awesome. That one flew under my radar. Somehow

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I didn't notice it. So very exciting. It's time to upgrade some stuff. All right. Do you have any

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:35.900
<v Speaker 2>extras? Well, I do. I have some repeat extras in a sense in that you and I both pulled this

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Sebastian Ramirez one out and I don't really have much more to say other than I want to say for sure

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:46.320
<v Speaker 2>this is a super nice documentary. It's super highly produced. It's done by Colt Repo. What a bad name.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.200
<v Speaker 2>The comments suggest like, what is this, like a weird cult or something?

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:57.260
<v Speaker 2>A much better channel name would be Repo Culture or Culture Repository or Repository Culture.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.460
<v Speaker 2>It's something about like, it covers open source basically, right?

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.520
<v Speaker 2>But cult repo is weird.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Anyway, it's the same group that did the one hour Python documentary that's really highly produced.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.040
<v Speaker 2>So that's all I want to say about that.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.540
<v Speaker 2>And with regard to the book, right?

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.280
<v Speaker 2>For the Talk Python in production book,

00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I actually started keeping a changelog.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I think we talked to, I think even you brought this up.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Keep a changelog.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Don't let your friends dump Git logs into changelogs.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Keep your changelog.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.880
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm keeping this for people who are like,

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.200
<v Speaker 2>what has changed about the book?

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Because at least, well, on Amazon,

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Amazon says they will release new versions as they feel like it

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.040
<v Speaker 2>if I upload a new EPUB.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Really?

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.120
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't say the time frame of it.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:45.620
<v Speaker 2>And

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.440
<v Speaker 2>those should automatically show on people's devices

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.320
<v Speaker 2>as updates. And then

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.620
<v Speaker 2>the Gumroad version, if you buy it directly from me,

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.460
<v Speaker 2>obviously I push up

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 2>new versions and have like

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.340
<v Speaker 2>numbers. And my book has a version number

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:58.720
<v Speaker 2>in it.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of fun. Anyway, so I'm keeping

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.300
<v Speaker 2>a changelog following the keep a changelog

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 2>style so people can see like

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.560
<v Speaker 2>do I care?

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Do I care about the change? Do I need to go back?

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:20.400
<v Speaker 1>so yeah and i also want to tell people that um it's the it used to be like you know several years

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:27.420
<v Speaker 1>ago when i did a my first ebook um it was a little little sketchier to to figure out how to get a

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:35.800
<v Speaker 1>book onto your kindle without um like without going through amazon and it's way easier now um if you

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:41.900
<v Speaker 1>just like if you grab a book like an e-book for me or from michael you can just email it to yourself

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you can set up a an email address that you just email it to yourself and it just shows up on your

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:51.960
<v Speaker 2>kindle yeah you your kindle gets an email so mine mine's something with the word paper right in it

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:58.000
<v Speaker 1>i don't remember exactly what it is but yeah and it's it's totally um you figure it out once and

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:03.779
<v Speaker 1>and i've got um yeah it's not bad it's not easy it's not easy it is very easy it's not hard so

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah yeah and uh road time follow-up sky as in the same sky that recommended

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:16.060
<v Speaker 2>um typos it looks like 3 14 2 came out just three days after 3 14 1 okay very interesting

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.960
<v Speaker 2>all right a couple more extras for me i was on vanishing gradients so that i told you that's

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 2>gonna be there that's out that was a very fun episode i a fun chat with hugo bone anderson

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.599
<v Speaker 2>and jango 6 is now officially released last week i talked about what was coming

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:40.600
<v Speaker 2>but like the day after we did that it's now actually out right so um if you're waiting on

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:46.200
<v Speaker 2>that jingo six is out see what it holds for you now brian i think i have a pretty fun pretty fun

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.180
<v Speaker 2>joke this is a little more elaborate than just like a dad joke or something are you ready yeah

00:28:54.659 --> 00:28:59.779
<v Speaker 2>so one of the there's like these joke programming languages that actually compile

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:06.080
<v Speaker 2>and stuff. And one that I really love is lolcats, lolcats, all one word. So good. So good. Actually

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:13.660
<v Speaker 2>has multiple implementations of it and it's, it's good. So, but we don't live in the time of lolcats

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:22.240
<v Speaker 2>anymore. That was like an early meme of the internet. So we now live in a hyper hyped,

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:32.520
<v Speaker 2>crazy headline overdone age as you know so i present to you the tabloid language oh my god

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:38.960
<v Speaker 2>are you ready oh my god here we go it's a minimal programming language inspired by clickbait

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.260
<v Speaker 3>headlines shocking new programming language bewilders programmers at google and facebook

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:51.059
<v Speaker 3>get up new headline tutorial so let's look at an example here discover how to fibonacci this is

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:59.160
<v Speaker 3>import basically discover how to no um this is the function actually discover how to fibonacci with

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:06.580
<v Speaker 3>a b n rumor this is like a try or something rumor has it what if n smaller than one shocking

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:16.339
<v Speaker 3>development b lies rumor has it you won't want to miss b shocking development fibonacci of b a plus b

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.400
<v Speaker 3>and minus one end of story end of story expert claims limit to be 10.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.660
<v Speaker 3>you won't want to miss first 10 fibonacci numbers you won't want to miss apparently it's print

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 3>and then i don't know what this last one is experts claim nothing to be fibonacci of

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:41.779
<v Speaker 3>one zero one limit i think that's like a test or an assert please subscribe like no output

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to run it. Hold on. Hold on. Run this. Oh my God. It runs.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.440
<v Speaker 3>What about factorial? You won't want to miss this. Hello world. Discover how to factorial with N.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Rumor has it. What if N is actually zero? Shocking development one. Lies. Shocking development N.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:06.640
<v Speaker 3>So good. Oh no. Lies is the else. Yeah. Lies is the else. Yeah. Lies. Because there's a,

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.620
<v Speaker 3>There's an assertion.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.400
<v Speaker 3>It goes, lies.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.560
<v Speaker 3>But I'm like, no, not the assertion.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.920
<v Speaker 3>It's really good, actually.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.460
<v Speaker 3>And notice it runs.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:15.580
<v Speaker 3>It runs.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.760
<v Speaker 3>It runs in the browser.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.600
<v Speaker 1>What is this built on?

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it's WebAssembly or if it's just JavaScript implementation.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.760
<v Speaker 2>It's all JavaScript.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:26.960
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.640
<v Speaker 2>It's so good, isn't it?

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.500
<v Speaker 1>I think we need a...

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.440
<v Speaker 1>But it used to be that this would be difficult,

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.220
<v Speaker 1>but we just have to have the spec for this.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:42.060
<v Speaker 1>and we could get like Claude or something to translate larger programs to tablet.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.860
<v Speaker 2>I might rewrite Python Bytes, the website in it.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.800
<v Speaker 2>I think lies, exclamation mark.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.800
<v Speaker 2>It requires an exclamation mark for lies.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh, by the way, people were just listening.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.480
<v Speaker 2>This is all the keywords.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.660
<v Speaker 2>The entire language is all caps.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.740
<v Speaker 2>So like lies, of course.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Anyway, I think it's pretty excellent.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.420
<v Speaker 2>This is old.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.500
<v Speaker 2>This is old.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:08.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize.

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I just ran across it.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.760
<v Speaker 2>But it's four years old.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Anyway, well done.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Well done, whoever made this.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.320
<v Speaker 2>This is amazing.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.340
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Also, Kiva in the audience points out that every time you print something, it also ends in an exclamation mark, even if the text itself doesn't have an exclamation mark.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah, obviously.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean, like, of course.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:34.960
<v Speaker 1>It has to.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.120
<v Speaker 3>lies this is the end of the show lies we have more no this is really good

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.600
<v Speaker 3>it's good

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:52.880
<v Speaker 1>so also uh for people uh uh watching the video i you'll notice a little less junk in my office

00:32:53.190 --> 00:33:00.499
<v Speaker 1>uh i'm starting to clean up after thanksgiving and we'll get there yeah anyway uh great episode

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 1>as always, Michael, thank you. Thank you, everybody

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.600
<v Speaker 1>for listening, and we'll see you all

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.620
<v Speaker 2>next week. What if actually

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.420
<v Speaker 2>this was the end? No. See you later.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Lies!

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Lies!
