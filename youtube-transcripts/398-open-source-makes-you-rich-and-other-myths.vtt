WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.080
Hey.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.380
Hey, hey.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.220
How are you?

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.780
Doing good. Ready to kick this thing off, huh, Brian?

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.960
Yeah, I am.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.280
Yeah, thank you for everyone being here.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.420
If you're watching the replay, awesome, thank you.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.860
But if you're here live, then you're here live a day early,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.880
and that's going to be normal.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.900
We'll talk about that in a second.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.760
Yeah.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.700
Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.520
where we deliver Python news and headlines

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.320
directly to your earbuds.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.580
This is episode 398, recorded August 26th, 2024.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.740
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.000
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.520
This episode is brought to you by us.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.800
Check out our things.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.620
Brian's assorted pytest courses.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.820
His book, the almost 300 hours of courses

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.780
over at talkpython.fm.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.240
So many things that you can do to support us

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.380
and get awesome stuff back in return.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.200
If you want to connect with us on the socials,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.060
check us out over on Mastodon.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.160
And we're also on X under very, very similar usernames.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.320
You can find us in all of the places.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.400
And of course, comment on the show on the YouTube stream,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.840
which is linked from the episode page all the time.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.680
And with that, Brian, how shall we start today?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.560
What do you got for us?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.260
Well, I've got some open source myths,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.780
but I wanted to touch on the day early bit, I think.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.260
Oh, yes, that's right.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.600
Because we are recording on Monday.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.400
This is not Tuesday.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.680
In fact, I looked at my watch,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.920
which has a little calendar,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.220
what's coming up next on Sunday,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.500
and it said Python bytes.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.560
I'm like, huh, that's weird.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.060
I feel like it's, I thought it was Sunday.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.700
It even caught me off guard.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.120
But now here we are.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.380
Yeah, my work schedule changed a little bit

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.880
and I got to go into work on Tuesdays and Wednesdays now.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.300
So we've moved the recording to Monday.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.940
That's just, that's the long short of it.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.820
Luckily, Michael has a fairly flexible schedule.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.640
Indeed.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.260
And that's the plan going forward, right?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.500
So until your meetings change again,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.240
for whatever reason,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.520
or you got to do trips,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.340
we're going to plan on doing every Monday,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.780
10 a.m. Pacific time.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.380
Yeah.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.240
And we'll get to that a little later.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.960
We've got a little cheat sheet for people

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.900
to be able to look up when it's going to be recorded.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.060
Oh, indeed.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.180
Very cool.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.700
Okay.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.780
So our first item though,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.300
I just wanted to talk about how awesome open source is.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.840
I'm working on open source software.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.340
And I was,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.660
there's somebody named Josh Bressers on Mastodon

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.700
posted a list of open source myths.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.840
So myths about working in open source

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.700
or using open source.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.980
And he started the list.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.220
And then on Mastodon,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.580
like, let's see,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.580
most projects have more than one maintainer.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.180
Yeah.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.240
Usually it's just one,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.160
which is,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.420
yeah,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.680
surprising to me also.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.540
So let's see.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.980
I like these two together.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.020
Open source is more secure than closed source

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.380
and open source is less secure than closed source.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.000
So both,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.120
both at the same time,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.160
they can exist.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.880
And so,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.280
and then he said,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.160
got any others?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.720
And a whole bunch of people sent him back myths.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.380
So he has a,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.580
let's see,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.400
a list on,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.800
on,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.320
he put it up on Google docs.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.640
and I made a copy.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.240
Cause I wanted to highlight a few of them because I thought it was,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.040
they were interesting.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.100
So a few,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.980
I want to call out.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.480
Most projects have funding driving the development.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.160
Yeah.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.460
No,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.760
I,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.120
does anybody think that?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.480
um,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.040
anyway,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.180
um,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.720
if the source code is available,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.700
it's open source.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.300
No,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.960
it's not.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.560
Um,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.420
and that's something that surprised me too,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.100
just because it's on GitHub even,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.640
uh,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.140
doesn't mean that it's open source.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.160
You can,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.440
uh,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.240
you can publish your,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.040
your,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.380
uh,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.840
proprietary code online.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.680
If you feel like it,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.340
people are,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.100
people are probably going to copy it anyway,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.740
uh,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.780
if you publish it,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.140
but it doesn't have to be open source.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.440
Uh,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.760
that's,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.020
yeah,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.920
it has,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.100
it has to do with the license,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.420
right?

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.780
Yep.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.700
Yeah.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.100
So most of the time I have,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.380
uh,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.160
I've been one of those people that just defaults to MIT because,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.420
uh,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.580
because I read it once and it went,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.180
Oh yeah,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.840
it sounds good.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.620
Basically MIT is what it's kind of like open source,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.020
but you,

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.780
it's open source,

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.460
but you can also,

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.480
you can also use it in commercial software if you want to.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.700
Um,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.820
and some of them,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.720
some of the licenses don't allow that.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.060
So,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.200
uh,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.020
my favorites coming up all,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.280
all open source developers live in Nebraska.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280
Um,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.780
I thought it was just one.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.700
I thought there literally was one open source person in Nebraska,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.700
according to XKCD.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.240
Nebraska.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.900
Oh yeah.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.660
Is that the XKCD thing?

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.400
Yeah.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.840
It's like the,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.540
we have this huge castle of everything supported by one person,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.400
single open source developer who lives in Nebraska.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.260
I believe that's right.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.000
So,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.440
um,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.560
so Marco says,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.960
Hey,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.720
um,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.940
I don't know if he's upset about not being in Nebraska or being the one

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.800
developer in Nebraska.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.340
Not sure.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.100
Um,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.700
uh,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.640
so I thought it was Kansas because there's,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.200
aren't all the Django people in Kansas.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.100
Um,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.120
yeah,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.480
Lawrence.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.680
And then,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.080
uh,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.280
let's see all open sources run by hippies.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.460
Sure.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.140
Um,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.920
wait,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.180
but it's in Nebraska and hippies aren't in Nebraska.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.620
So,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.660
or maybe they are,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.760
or they're hippies in Nebraska.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.560
I don't know.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.120
Never been there.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.800
Open source means it costs $0.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.880
Well,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.900
you can use it without paying,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.460
but it doesn't cost zero to make it.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.020
Um,

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.600
everything is being rewritten,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.800
rewritten in rust.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.340
Um,

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.880
it does seem like that lately,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.580
but,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.880
uh,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.120
no,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.860
there's a lot of stuff that's not good.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.040
We'll talk more about that one later.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.580
Um,

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.220
yeah,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.780
I guess that's,

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.800
that's a decent segue.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.320
Uh,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.520
no,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.820
there's,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.560
this is a cool,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.480
a fun list of,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.780
uh,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.620
some of them are,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.000
are useful items.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.560
Um,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.780
open source makes you rich.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.280
No,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.020
it doesn't.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.280
Well,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.760
maybe it makes some people rich.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.760
It hasn't worked for me yet.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.860
Um,

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.440
yeah,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.880
anyway,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.840
a fun list.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.420
So thanks Josh for putting this together.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.240
Yeah,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.140
that's a really excellent one.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.460
Actually.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.820
I love it.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.200
Okay.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.160
On to my first item.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.820
I've got a,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.820
uh,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.700
a bunch of things that I'm going to cover and I know you do as well,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.040
Brian,

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.240
this week.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.860
So someone will go fast.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.720
Some will dive into.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.800
Mostly we'll go fast.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:28.840
So this one is a feature capability framework matrix for people who do functions as a service or AKA serverless.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.020
Right.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.560
I am,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.880
I'll go on the record and say,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.380
I am somewhat skeptical about the usefulness of serverless,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.960
but I know for some people,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.960
for some of their setups,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.960
they absolutely love it.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.380
And certainly for you,

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.600
there,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.320
there are tons of interesting use cases around serverless.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.940
All right.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.940
All right.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.940
All right.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.940
All right.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.940
All right.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.940
Um,

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.620
certainly the most common one is Lambda.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.760
AWS Lambda,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.280
I would say.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.340
And we also have Azure functions,

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.480
which is the serverless thing that lives in Azure.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.980
Azure,

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.580
we previously talked about cloud flare workers.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:08.420
And what's cool about the cloud flare workers is that they run on WASM or WebAssembly.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.540
Now the WASM ones start to get really interesting to me.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:19.240
So if I've got a Docker container in AWS and it spins up every time there's a call to one of my functions.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.680
Okay.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.880
Interesting.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.560
Maybe I should just have a Docker container running instead of like a bunch of start,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.780
stop,

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.000
start,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.240
start,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.460
start,

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.720
stop.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.780
And,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.220
uh,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.460
sort of a funky,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.060
uh,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.440
pricing.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.780
You're not really sure about there is a pricing chart you can get into.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:39.540
But the reason I really thought this was interesting is there's a couple of them that run on the client.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.860
As far as I know,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.580
there's not necessarily even,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.240
uh,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.280
for usage fee there because it's running not on their infrastructure.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.860
It's just shipping some bytes.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.480
So one of them,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.420
we talked about cloud flare.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.500
Another one I want to talk about is from fermion.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.220
This is Python 311 plus.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.980
And if you scroll over hiding on the side,

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.520
there's a link,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.100
there's this thing called spin.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.500
Don't know if you've heard of it,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:04.680
Brian,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.500
I've never heard of it.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.580
No spin Python SDK.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.740
So it says,

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.740
we'll look at how to build a serverless app using Python.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.800
and deploy it to fermion cloud in a few simple steps.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.120
And it talks about how all this stuff works.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.680
It's based on a plugin called pi to wasm.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.400
And by the way,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.520
this may run in their cloud.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.400
I can't remember this because you can run pi to wasm.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.480
Uh,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.520
you can run wasm code locally,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.600
or you can run it in the browser.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:30.980
Right.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.900
So yeah,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.160
it could go either way,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.180
but basically this gives you a WebAssembly,

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:42.180
super lightweight foundation to run Python code for your app,

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.300
which I think is pretty awesome.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.900
So here's this grid.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.220
The,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:47.560
the,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.760
the news item is this,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.940
this matrix of these comparisons,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.920
but some of them that it points out here are based on wasm,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.780
which is pretty interesting.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.260
The fly IO one is based on micro VM.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.980
it talks about which frameworks you can use.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.420
Do you directly program it?

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.640
Like FastAPI for cloud flare or spin for fermion?

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.900
Lask for Google,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.840
a lot of interesting stuff here and how to process it.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.780
And then also the pricing.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.180
Um,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.040
yeah,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.740
this is actually timely because I have a project that's good.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.540
I was thinking about doing some,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:21.900
uh,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.820
some Lambda functions and things like that.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.140
So,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:26.900
yeah.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.080
Yeah.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.080
Was it last time or the time before where said,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.780
uh,

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.640
highlighted something where someone had gotten like a $96,000 fair sale bill

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.820
for doing some of their processing.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.380
Yeah.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.240
That'll catch you off guard.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.300
So you want to know what you're in for.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:43.660
And this,

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.880
this is a nice comparison.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.860
I think it's pretty,

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.560
it's really,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:46.940
you know,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.680
I don't know why it has to be so complicated.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.960
Like the Google one is 40 cents per 1 million requests plus zero,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.160
zero,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.400
zero,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:53.640
zero,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:53.880
zero,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.120
zero,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.320
zero,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:54.380
zero,

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:54.520
zero,

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:54.700
two,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.760
five cents per gigabyte,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.660
uh,

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.000
per second.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.940
Is that where?

00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.500
Yeah.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.200
And then some more for CPU and then some more for egress,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:02.420
you know,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:02.620
like,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.040
wait a minute,

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.340
like others are based on memory.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:05.900
It's just like,

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.900
it really hard to understand.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.860
I don't know,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.700
but that's how it goes.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.100
Wait,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.460
what's egress data out.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.380
Oh,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.320
as opposed to data in,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.000
I thought they were type of bird.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.880
Yeah.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.740
Well,

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:23.320
it usually lives like right above fiber optic cables and it goes only away from data centers.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.680
That's his migration pattern is away from data centers.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.400
12 cents per egret.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:27.880
Yeah.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.000
They're big.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.520
They carry a lot of data on them birds though.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:31.900
It's okay.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.560
Yeah.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.200
So that's why I like to have most of my data go under the underwater.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.160
There's no birds.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.060
Yeah.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.240
So people could check this out.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.460
They,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:41.880
they want,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.300
it's just a GitHub repo.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.100
Uh,

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.140
you can obviously make contributions and add stuff and so on.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.960
Huh?

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.940
That's pretty cool.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.640
Nice.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.340
Yeah.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:51.560
All right.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.060
Uh,

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.220
back to you.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.980
Okay.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.300
Well,

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:54.660
I,

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.020
um,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.560
we have talked about this,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:56.900
uh,

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.120
this,

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.020
this top PI packages before.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.600
I'm pretty sure.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.140
Um,

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.840
uh,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.860
from Hugo VK.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:02.380
Uh,

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:02.800
it's a,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.380
it's just a list that's,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.160
that's updated.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.920
Um,

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.700
um,

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.000
I'm going to,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.180
I don't want to call out Hugo too much,

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:10.680
but it's,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.020
uh,

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.640
it's supposed to be updated monthly and it was last updated in July.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.500
Yeah.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.840
Maybe we get some August updates.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.160
Anyway,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.900
well,

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.440
maybe he's traveling near,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.820
uh,

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.100
relative ballistic speeds,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.540
in which case that would explain it.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.160
Oh yeah.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.460
Maybe.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:23.860
Okay.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.400
Anyway,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.560
that's close enough.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:25.800
So,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.100
you know,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.740
it's a month old,

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.320
but that's all right.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.960
Anyway,

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.520
so there's a,

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.360
a list of,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.680
um,

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.440
uh,

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.900
it shows the top hundred,

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.060
hundred right away,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.240
but you can,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:34.560
uh,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.620
you can show the top 8,000.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.420
So what,

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.660
what are the things I've used this before is to try to find the top pie test

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.040
plugins.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.820
So I'll grab this data or I'll like,

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.040
you know,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.060
show the 8,000 and then I'll like search for pie tests,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:47.540
just,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.760
just pie test.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.140
And because most plugins are pie tests.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.520
So the top one's going to be pie tests.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.640
And then the next ones are like,

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.320
you know,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.940
the plugins because they often,

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.220
you have pie test in the name.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.080
It's handy.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.460
So I thought it'd be cool if I just did something about this and made my own

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:01.760
list.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:02.940
So I did,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:03.380
uh,

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.900
this weekend I decided to,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.900
to give it a shot.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.760
Um,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.300
I wrote,

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:07.680
uh,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:13.420
top pie test plugins and I just grabbed the top 8,000 cause it's,

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:13.880
he just,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.380
uh,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.760
it's available on GitHub.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.400
Um,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.740
he just publishes the top 8,000 all the time,

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.740
uh,

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.300
once a month.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:20.780
Um,

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.160
you can grab those as a Jason file and parse it.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.580
So,

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.420
uh,

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.160
grab that.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.900
and then,

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.320
um,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.360
and I'm listing,

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.260
um,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.180
and I'm listing,

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.220
um,

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.480
I just grabbed all the pie test things with pie test in the name other than

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.040
the top,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.080
other than pie test.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:35.940
Uh,

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.920
and I grabbed,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.160
there's 142.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.440
it's basically all 8,000 and however many.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.740
So 142 plugins show up in the top 8,000.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.860
Um,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.480
I would,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.240
I thought it was cool.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.120
The pie test check shows up this.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.120
That's my little plugin.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.260
Uh,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.340
uh,

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.160
made the top 25,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.100
top 25.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:54.560
Yeah.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:54.940
It's,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:55.840
it's at 25.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.780
So that's cool.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.800
Um,

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.380
yeah.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.960
And a bunch of that I love in here,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.540
there's actually some pretty cool stuff that,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.860
that I want to explore more by looking at this.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.820
A lot of the top,

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.360
like the top 10 or so,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.980
they don't change much because you've got tons of people,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.040
projects using them.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.420
Even though pie test runner,

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.060
come on people,

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.040
pie test runner should not be the number second one because it is deprecated.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.360
Um,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.360
it uses it.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:21.800
It's,

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.720
it's so that you can write your use,

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.300
run pie test test from Python,

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.920
set up.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.000
Dot pie test.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.240
And like,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.120
who does that anymore?

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.660
I don't know.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.220
I thought everybody was 30 million people do that.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.440
Yeah,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:35.960
apparently.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.500
So,

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.300
uh,

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:38.580
anyway,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.100
um,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.100
I thought it was fun.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.600
The,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.060
the downloads.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.800
So top pipe packages just gives me the name and the download count.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.580
So I wanted to know like how to,

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.840
how to get the summary on there.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.460
So I asked,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:52.740
um,

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.720
asked on Mastodon,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.800
and,

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.120
uh,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.520
Jeff triplet delivered.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.700
And he said,

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:57.940
Hey,

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.000
why don't you use the,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.340
um,

00:13:59.340 --> 00:13:59.800
um,

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.320
the API from,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.500
from,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.480
from the,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.760
yeah,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.200
pipe is built on warehouse and warehouse has an API.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.840
So you can use it to get some interesting information.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.900
So I did that.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.360
And that's how the summaries come in.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.580
I wrote up a blog post about it.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.280
So that's linked,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:15.920
um,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.060
about how this is done.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.080
And then,

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.640
uh,

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.360
what published the code also.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.140
So you can check it out.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.540
And then I was like,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.360
it's dumb code.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:23.560
Why?

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.080
Well,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.240
I'll publish it anyway.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:25.680
why not?

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.540
And,

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:26.760
uh,

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.780
Jeff triplet says,

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.340
um,

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:28.600
yeah,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.200
it needs cleaned up a bit.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.520
So he threw it into Claude three and a half,

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.240
3.5.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.020
Um,

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:34.900
and,

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.140
uh,

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:35.900
came up with,

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.260
um,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.920
what Claude says is the better,

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.940
better code.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.560
Uh,

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.980
so anyway,

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.520
he also added rich.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.100
So I have to incorporate this.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.680
Rich and typer.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.320
Yeah.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.460
He added rich and typer,

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:46.740
which,

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.280
and really didn't add much code.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:49.640
So,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.600
Ooh,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.020
green.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.080
He did the,

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.340
the download count in green and the,

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:54.780
uh,

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.700
packages in magenta and the,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.080
what the down,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.300
Oh,

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.580
the download counts are in green and the number is in cayenne cyan.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.280
I don't know.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.500
So thanks Jeff.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.940
So anyway,

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.260
yeah,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.680
very cool.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.600
I love it.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.240
Now,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:12.640
uh,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.820
just one more request for your,

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.100
um,

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:14.680
blog post there.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.580
Would it be cool to see a graph of like popularity?

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.120
So,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.860
so you can sort of see what does the tail look like in terms for,

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.120
so you can see it till off pretty quick,

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.160
but as a picture,

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.320
how would those numbers look,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:27.700
you know?

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.640
Oh yeah.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.320
Graph.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.900
Okay.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.160
So graph of popularity,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:31.860
that'd be fun.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.240
Uh,

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.340
I wanted to see,

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:34.800
um,

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.620
uh,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.360
there's a couple other things I wanted to see,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:38.860
like the,

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:39.100
um,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.760
the witch Python version that it supports.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.060
Cause,

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.780
um,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.660
and,

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.120
and I,

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.440
I also kind of want to dig in a little bit to see which ones it's tested

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:47.860
against.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.420
So if we,

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.780
if there's some way to look into the code to see,

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.520
um,

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.600
it supports three,

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.760
eight and above often,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.480
but,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.080
uh,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.600
it's test,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:55.980
has it,

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.520
is it tested on three 12 yet?

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:57.940
Uh,

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.600
sort of things.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.320
Yeah.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.160
Interesting.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.760
Yeah.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.320
Does it support free threading?

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.140
Yeah.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.200
Um,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.420
I don't know.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.700
The other thing that I thought would be cool was,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.020
um,

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.200
uh,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.640
is somebody requested this on,

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:12.960
uh,

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.520
Mastodon,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.440
um,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.320
some trending for like keeping track of this over a while,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.500
over time and seeing some deltas,

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.800
like which ones,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.180
which ones are going like,

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:22.500
uh,

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.100
uh,

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.860
upward trends or downward trends or something.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.820
Oh yeah.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.060
Yeah.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.020
That would be cool to see where the,

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.000
the momentum is for them.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.880
Yeah.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.300
Oh,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.320
one of the things I did want to shout out for Jeff,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.080
um,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.400
his version of this,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:37.780
uh,

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.200
does,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:38.960
it just takes,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.360
it also takes the,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:40.640
uh,

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.320
package name as a input.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.420
So you can,

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.380
if you wanted to look for things with Django in the name or things with,

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.380
you know,

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.600
something else like Jason in the name or something,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:50.980
you can,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.360
you can search for those as well that way with his.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.520
So often.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.100
Excellent.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:55.520
Yeah.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:55.740
Yeah.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:56.300
That's super cool.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.060
And Henry out there says a badge given the rank would be fun.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.960
Given the rank.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.180
Like the,

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.600
you can put it on your GitHub read me.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.940
It's just like number 26,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.600
most popular pintest.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.380
Oh yeah.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.820
Plug in something like that.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:11.960
I'm,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.340
I'm reading into this,

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.000
but that's what I think.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.200
Yeah.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.620
Star count.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.240
It's get up.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:18.580
Star count.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:18.960
Does it,

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.080
does that matter too much?

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.380
Yeah,

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:21.840
perhaps.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.020
All right.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.240
Derivative of star count.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.200
Is it going up like fast?

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.560
Anyway,

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.760
let's carry on.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.740
You're going to have a whole master's thesis.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.300
Definitely.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.120
Mike shed this for a long time,

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.680
but we good.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.420
Yeah,

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.700
we could.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.060
Let's hit the big news of the week,

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.140
which news.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:41.560
Yeah.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.220
I swooped in.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.420
I know you're going to cover it as well.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.380
I learned you were going to cover it after I grabbed it as a topic.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.140
So this comes from the astral folks and Charlie Marsh.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:55.280
And maybe I'm going to have Charlie on talk Python and me to cover this

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.360
tomorrow or in a week.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.060
I'm not sure he's traveling,

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.840
I think,

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.640
or something like that.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.080
So we'll see if we can make it happen tomorrow,

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.860
but very soon,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.320
Charlie's going to come on talk Python.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.000
I'm going to dive in deeper into this,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.680
but let's spend a few minutes on it.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.820
Here's the announcement.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.460
The official announcement is UV.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.100
We've talked about UV before.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.780
It's started out as kind of a pip replacement,

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.460
but it's growing to do more and more things now.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.240
And the announcement is UV,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.200
a unified Python packaging.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.580
So there's been a lot of trends in Python packaging about tools that

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:39.000
disintermediate pip and some of the other things we do with lock files.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.620
And there's sort of been two takes.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.080
One take is we build stuff inside Python.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.020
Then once we have Python and we have this tool,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.520
then we manage our projects.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:49.920
You know,

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.640
I'm thinking of things like hatch or poetry.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.600
On the other hand,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.920
there's been things that try to manage Python from the outside.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.580
And probably the most well-known one is PI ENV,

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.860
not pip ENV,

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.600
PI ENV,

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.120
which gives you your Python or maybe Knox talks for testing and it'll

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.580
manage the Python and the environments.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.640
And so they're coming,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.380
Charlie and Astral are coming at this from that outer,

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.240
outside perspective more, right?

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.080
Here's a tool that doesn't depend on Python.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.120
And until recently,

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.240
it's been a fast way to do pip things and pip compile and so on.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.300
But now this is a big,

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.240
big announcement for,

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.380
here's the thing that can kind of be cargo.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.160
Cargo is the Rust version of this.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.680
I think there's a lot of inspiration for a lot of people around that.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.480
I don't use Rust so it doesn't inspire or disinspire me and just whatever.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.440
But here's the thing.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.960
It has end-to-end project management.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.160
So you can add dependencies.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.620
You can run tools against your program,

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.260
like pytest or whatever.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.140
It can create a lock files.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.660
It can update those lock files.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.620
It can install Python.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.300
And we talked about that last time, right, Brian?

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:11.920
Yeah.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.960
So UV Python install or UV Python list and all those options.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.500
It can run,

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.100
now run scripts,

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.880
which is pretty interesting.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:27.960
So if I gave you a single Python file and like Jeff Triplett's example,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.360
it depended upon HTTPX.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.740
And I gave that to you and said,

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.520
Hey, Brian, run this.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.940
What would you do?

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.280
You'd be like,

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.060
Hey, try to run it.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:35.980
No, it doesn't run.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:41.580
I guess I need a virtual environment or I'll just into my system,

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.940
install HTTPX,

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.720
and then it's going to need another and so on.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.060
That's a hassle, right?

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.180
So with this script execution thing,

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.640
what you do is you put into somewhere,

00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:00.780
into the top of your file as a multi-comment.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.680
It's a hash and then it has four slashes.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.760
I don't know.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.180
Meta comment within a comment.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:10.300
You put a comment here that says what this library depends upon.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:14.460
And then theoretically, you should be able to run this.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.000
So if you say UV run and you give it the script,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.300
it'll look at that and say,

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.520
Oh, I'm going to need to quick install or find the cached version of what's listed at the top of this.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.380
So as long as you had UV, I could just give you any file.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.500
You could run it.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:38.440
And that could be a cool distribution mechanism throughout your company or utility tools where at least you've agreed upon UV as a basis.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:45.380
It's pretty cool because I think this one even creates a little virtual environment to install stuff and run.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.740
It's yeah,

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.740
all this stuff has a lot to do with virtual environments.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:54.380
And I don't know if it's a persistent virtual environment, but yeah, it does isolate these things.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.180
And so there's two ways.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.780
The reason I'm not certain is there's two ways to do this.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:07.220
Like you can create a project and start it, initialize it or sync it and get it going.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:12.980
You can also create virtual environments here with UV.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:20.560
And it'll go and create one of these based on, say, the PyProject.famil or something.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.320
But you can also run commands.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:29.920
There's ways to just run the tooling stuff that they're doing.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:35.720
And when you look at that, it will use, I don't think it creates a virtual environment,

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.020
but it uses the cached versions and just runs in kind of an isolate.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.980
So if you say UV tool run, which is alias to UVX, kind of like NPMX,

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.120
it uses an isolated environment.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.080
But yeah, exactly.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.740
The environment doesn't last, right?

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.440
Whereas if you say UV tool install versus UV tool run,

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.700
there's like variations about this, right?

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.180
But the gist of it, that like as a user,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:10.660
it's not throwing stuff into my global Python, which I want.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.460
I don't want that.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.420
So it's doing the right thing.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:19.020
I might not know what it is, but it's not like polluting the global Python.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.380
Yes, absolutely.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.560
Yeah, exactly.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.220
It does the right thing for you.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.720
And it does it super, super fast.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.240
I was checking out an example.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.980
And after you've run it once,

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.500
after it's basically cached the dependencies, it's instant.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.780
It's as if those things were just there, right?

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.560
As if you were in an activated virtual environment and good to go.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.260
Yeah.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.000
I'm really, I've been changing my workflow over to all this,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.920
especially since, so that we did kind of cover it last week,

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:55.260
but all the neat things that I saw in UV were all like experimental.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.120
They're not experimental anymore.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.840
They're all locked in.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.000
Yeah.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.380
Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.360
This is the big, big release we have in the audience.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.420
Makeshift says, super into UV, primarily for Python management,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.920
interested in script execution and packing that up

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.360
into something that acts like a single binary executable.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:13.620
Yeah.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.820
It kind of does give you the sense of,

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.480
long as you're connected to the internet,

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:22.340
here's the thing that's always ready to run all versions of Python,

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.920
all dependencies, you know, regardless of the dependencies,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.080
regardless of the version that it says,

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.120
assuming that it's in the UV Python listing,

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.560
you can just run it, right?

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.840
And if it's not there, it'll download it.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.640
But if it is there, it'll use the cached version.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.780
And off it goes, which is pretty awesome.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.320
Yeah.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.560
You bring up something interesting that I haven't tried is like,

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.980
if you run all these tool chains for a while

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.400
and you disconnect from the internet, what happens?

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.280
I think if it's cached, it's okay.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.260
But if it's not cached, it's probably not okay.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:52.980
Okay.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.420
Makes sense.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.700
That's what I believe.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:55.960
Yeah.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.400
Because the speed at which it runs,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.520
I doubt that it's every time checking,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.540
unless you ask it to do an update.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:08.880
There's like sync and lock commands versus run and so on.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.940
There's other interesting things we're diving into here,

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.380
for example, like the Docker integration.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.660
If you don't even want this thing on your computer,

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:24.440
you can actually get a Docker version, run it,

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.140
and then just alias commands to your Docker container

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.200
or things like that,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.680
or it talks about how to use,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.460
how to build it using Docker,

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.040
or like here you go, for example,

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.880
here's how you would get it to run,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.620
get it to install and run something using a Docker command and so on.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.500
So there's a lot of things going on,

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.120
GitHub actions, pre-commits.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.880
This is a super deep project.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.840
If you look at a release,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.520
if you look at workspaces,

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.520
this is a lot of stuff around mono repos.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.260
So if you've got a bunch of different packages

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:10.980
and you want them all to be treated as kind of managed by one thing here,

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.140
but you can say I have a dependency,

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.800
this part of my code has a dependency in another part of my code,

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.720
please install it as you're running with it

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.940
or just run it in editable form out of this directory.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.000
A lot of stuff going on here.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.940
I've been checking it out this morning.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:32.980
So I'm going to let people dive in more for themselves here

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:38.240
and maybe listen to the Talk Python episode with Charlie soon.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.780
However, also I want to say thank you to a couple of folks who sent in this.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.460
Skylar Casco and John Hagen both sent in and said,

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.720
hey, you guys should check out these things around this announcement.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:55.020
One is Simon Wilson, speaking of living in Kansas.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.360
He no longer lives in Kansas, but part of the Django team.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:03.680
He wrote a blog post called UV Unified Python Packaging,

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.760
huge release from the Astral team,

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:11.060
and basically says, this has been out for a couple of hours.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.740
Let me just give you my real quick impressions.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.440
It's kind of like a walkthrough almost.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.940
Here's what I think is important from it.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:24.200
I think more interesting perhaps is to bump over to Omnivore here

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:30.040
and look at what Armin Roeneker said of original creator of Flask,

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.200
most recent creator of Rye, R-Y-E,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.760
which has been something kind of trying to do this a little bit,

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.820
but not as ambitious.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:45.700
And he handed over ownership of Rye to the Astral folks as well.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.560
So some of this stuff is kind of a blending of these things.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.540
So his article is super interesting.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.220
There's a lot of opinion and takes on it.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.200
I'll put a few highlights here in Omnivore.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:02.740
So for example, when creating Rye, he says,

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:09.460
one of the things I mentioned there is that the goal of a packaging tool has to be that it will dominate the space.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:19.260
That is, it's awesome that it's not in like a, if you're a second, you're the first loser.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:24.660
Not in that sense, but in the sense for it like really to make a big impact, it has to be the way.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:25.540
Right.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:36.200
If there's 20 ways, then, yeah, it's more of like the Mandalorian thing.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.180
This is the way.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:37.560
That's right.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:43.540
So if it's going to simplify the Python experience,

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.440
it can't be that there's 20 ways, different and unrelated ways to simplify.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.400
There has to be a way we kind of agree on, right?

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.720
I don't agree, but that's okay.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.740
Yeah, no, I hear you.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.880
I really want everyone who gets to learn and experience Python,

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.380
not to remember it as an old language, bad tooling,

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.440
but it is an amazing language with stellar developer experience.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.100
Unfortunately, that's not the case today because there are so much choice,

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:13.240
so many tools that are not quite compatible and by the inconsistency everywhere.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.680
That's what he's getting at.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.660
He said, well, I think UV is poised to be this tool.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.800
Now the momentum, now's the moment to step up as a community

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.160
and start to start to rally around it.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:25.520
Yeah?

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.400
You need to take the next step.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.600
Say some of these tools are no longer recommended.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.780
For example, we stopped recommending Easy Install

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.920
and took them out of our guides.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:42.520
So I recommend that you consider making UV an option in your documentation.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.780
Also has a little bit of interesting commentary about,

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.580
well, this is VC funded.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.940
What if they turn evil?

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.580
I don't think that they will, but what if they did?

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.840
And he talks about that as well.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.720
So.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.560
Yeah.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.140
We can always fork it.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.840
Yeah.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.020
Let's see what Henry has to say as well out there.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.700
Says, this is basically mostly faster PIPX replacements,

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.900
the script runner, tool management, tool running without installing first.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.340
I agree.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.440
There's, I didn't point it out, but you're right,

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.200
that there's a lot of overlap of PIPX and this,

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.620
although I think there's more to it as well.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.040
Yeah.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.060
One of the things I'm, I'm interested in is there's, there's been,

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.620
I've never really, there's something about the,

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.100
there's nothing, nothing really against PDM,

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.880
but my, my experience with it was just not what,

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.000
not what I like to do.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.820
And, and UV,

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.260
the UV tools have taken a lot of the ideas from PDM as well,

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.140
which is interesting that they're, they're looking at all,

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.520
they're taking the inspiration from all over the place.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.500
So they are.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.840
One of the things I don't necessarily like is a lot of it,

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:57.280
a lot of it turns the Python package and sort of environment

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:03.540
and project management into UV project and package management.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:08.160
So for example, you know,

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.780
you type UVX run or UV,

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:16.020
UV add instead of PIP, just pip install, right?

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.960
Like where the UV add will put it into the,

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.740
the lock file and as a requirement and so on.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.000
And yeah.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.640
And the lock files, even like UV dot lock or something.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.960
Yes.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.320
So I am quite excited about it.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.160
However,

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.580
a lot of the stuff has,

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.300
you know,

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.400
it's kind of founded on virtual environments,

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.480
which if you just want to activate the virtual environment and go do your thing,

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.720
once you,

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.720
you maybe get your Python installed,

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.760
if it didn't exist or whatever,

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.380
then you can go on and do a lot of things,

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.720
the Python way without worrying about it.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.920
But it's going to be interesting what the adoption is.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.600
I'm going to talk to Charlie soon about it.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.140
And that'll be fun.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.320
Good.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.560
I'll listen to that one.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.100
Yeah.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.540
I'm super excited about UV in general.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.580
So we'll see where it goes.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:59.140
Yeah.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.180
All right.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.460
I believe that is it for our main items.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.180
Well,

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.580
based on your,

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.320
your tab count,

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.220
I'm guessing that you're feeling pretty extra.

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.100
Yeah.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.100
This will go quick though.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.240
I wanted to point out that the,

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.240
the Jeff triplet rewrite of the top Python packages is,

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.920
is already scriptified UV scriptified.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.120
he included the script at the top to pull in the dependencies.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.200
And you know,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.760
once you look at it for something you're,

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.000
you're,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
you're familiar with,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.260
you're like,

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:31.440
Oh,

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:31.960
that's easy.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.060
You're just adding like HTTPX rich and typer to the dependencies and

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.640
telling which Python version.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.400
That's really all.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.080
That's,

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:39.460
I mean,

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.640
there might be other stuff that you can do,

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.680
but this is great to be able to just do UV run with this.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.320
So I wonder if the editors auto collapse that it'd be awesome.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.780
If you just never see that unless you want to,

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.440
you know,

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.160
like it collapses,

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.900
that folds the code for those sections on open.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.260
Yeah.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.180
Cause if you had like some weird,

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.100
some weird,

00:32:59.100 --> 00:32:59.380
uh,

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.320
corporate thing that you had to stick at the top of your code,

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:02.700
also,

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.980
you'd have to scroll down three pages before you get actual.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.420
Yeah.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:07.740
Um,

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.620
okay.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:08.920
so,

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.060
uh,

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.280
this is a,

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:10.380
uh,

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:10.380
this is a,

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:10.800
like us,

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.260
uh,

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.160
owed to Hugo because,

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:13.960
or Hugo VK,

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.480
because,

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.340
uh,

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:15.760
he also,

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.160
uh,

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.320
let us know that when we changed the date from Tuesday to Monday,

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.480
people could use,

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.400
are we meeting yet.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.040
Um,

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.840
to keep track of,

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.180
um,

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.640
of when the meeting is because it,

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.680
it converts to your time,

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.240
whatever we push this in at.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.980
So I'm seeing that,

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:34.540
uh,

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.760
the next meeting is,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.280
uh,

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.800
is August 26th.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.320
That's today.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:40.920
Um,

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.640
so,

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.300
but if you go here when we're not here,

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.020
it'll tell you that there's,

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:46.260
um,

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.720
there's like a meeting coming up and it'll show how many,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.160
how many,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.420
how much time left.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.860
And there's even a calendar entry that you can add,

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.460
um,

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:53.880
there.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.820
So that's fun.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.960
And then a link to the,

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.740
I added the link to the live stream.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.960
So if you click on the live stream,

00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.500
link,

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.300
you can see live stream.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.360
So then that's the real way.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.160
Cause this is,

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:03.960
if you do a,

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.400
are we,

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.920
are we meeting yet.com?

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.180
It doesn't update if we ever have to change things,

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:08.700
but yeah,

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.000
the time is embedded in the URL.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.260
It just adapts that time and the title for your location.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:13.860
Yeah.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:14.940
So if you really,

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:15.400
uh,

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.980
want to make sure check out the live stream link.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.600
Okay.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.340
So,

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:19.860
um,

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.820
and while I was looking at the top,

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.420
um,

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.260
the top IPI packages,

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.480
I was looking through,

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:25.900
uh,

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.160
at Hugo VK's,

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:27.600
um,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.980
other projects and I'm like,

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:30.160
oh,

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.040
there's some cool stuff here that he's published.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.540
So I wanted to shout out to,

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:33.820
uh,

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.560
to a couple of these Python logos from around the world from different

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.040
picons.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.780
So these are fun.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:40.680
Um,

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.680
he just has a selection of different ones.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:42.980
Like,

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.360
uh,

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.040
yeah,

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:44.960
it's great.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.700
I love these.

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.600
That's pretty.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.940
Pycon Zimbabwe.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.620
That's awesome.

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:50.300
Um,

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:50.300
um,

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:50.300
um,

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:50.300
um,

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:50.320
um,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:50.320
um,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:50.320
um,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:50.900
um,

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.720
and then also,

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.180
uh,

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.400
PyPI downloads.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.020
Um,

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.040
it's some,

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:55.260
some,

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:55.560
some,

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.720
uh,

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.480
tools for Python tools with the download counts for versions over time,

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.680
which is sort of fascinating how slow some stuff like gradually gets down.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.220
So what is,

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.720
what are we looking at here?

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.220
We've got,

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:09.700
uh,

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.080
three,

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.960
three,

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.600
12.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.740
So we've got the,

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.720
this blue is three,

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.080
10,

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.360
three,

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:16.580
10,

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:16.880
11,

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.940
12 is blue is,

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.700
is up in this top right corner.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.760
And then the old ones like nine,

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.020
eight,

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:23.340
seven,

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:23.800
six,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.300
five,

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:24.820
three,

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:25.120
four,

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.840
are just gradually going down over time.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.840
Um,

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.340
and it,

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.100
I kind of would have expected a sharper drop,

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:32.500
but,

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.360
um,

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:33.880
yeah,

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.580
it's interesting.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:34.900
And that,

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.460
that,

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.400
that sort of trend goes like,

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:37.840
here's your,

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.640
I love three.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:38.960
Yeah.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.760
Two,

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.840
six on there for a while.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.560
Yeah.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:42.980
Well,

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.420
and two,

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:44.860
yeah,

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.200
two,

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.520
six did like take a long time to completely disappear.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.220
Two,

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.720
seven is down.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.100
into the like single digit percents,

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.340
but it's not gone away.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:54.960
Um,

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.540
so yeah.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.000
Anyway,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.760
uh,

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.140
interesting.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:35:59.720
Um,

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.360
the other thing,

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:00.620
uh,

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.040
he's got,

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:01.440
uh,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:01.740
uh,

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.020
Python.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.000
There's a bunch of stuff,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:03.940
Python core devs.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.420
I thought was interesting of different core devs and their,

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.160
when they started and stopped.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:08.640
So I,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.500
I didn't know that people stopped.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.900
I thought we were like core dev for life or something,

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.200
but,

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:13.960
um,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.120
you don't have to be,

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:15.680
I guess.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.100
So interesting,

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:17.800
uh,

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.300
graphic.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.740
The other thing I wanted to,

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.700
the last thing I wanted to,

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.860
extra is that,

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.260
um,

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:23.640
at,

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:23.960
uh,

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.200
Python test.com.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.800
We've got the courses of course,

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.380
and they're going,

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.520
they're going really well.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.680
And I'm excited about that.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.440
The,

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.040
the other thing we've added is,

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:32.340
uh,

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:32.980
when I had an,

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.940
on the other platform,

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.340
I used to be on teachable.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.140
Now we're on,

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:36.500
uh,

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.700
podia.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:38.320
Um,

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.080
but podia has a community thing.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.720
So we've added community options so that if,

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.600
if you like,

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.160
for instance,

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.900
this is a great about the community options,

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.060
because if you bought the book physical book,

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.320
but you have a question,

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.840
how do you get that answered?

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.280
Well,

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.260
you can hop on and,

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:52.700
uh,

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.100
and join the community here.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.400
So then you can answer,

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.240
ask questions.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.980
Do you have any extras for us?

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.360
Oh,

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.020
I have many,

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.060
but I'll make them quick as well.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:11.740
the Python course for coding in a castle and October 5th to 12th is happening.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.300
And the time is coming up short for if you want to be part of it.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.780
So I would love to spend a week with you in Italy,

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.960
half programming and half drinking wine and traveling around.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.100
So if you could,

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.480
if you're interested about in being in that and you're like,

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:24.660
Oh,

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.600
maybe that would be interesting.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.420
Well,

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.220
time,

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.020
the time is now to sign up because,

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:30.320
uh,

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.680
we're going to call it'll be done.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.200
And soon,

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:33.700
you know,

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.020
the,

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.320
the applications will be closed.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.460
Also follow up from last week.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.320
Remember I talked about PI awaitable.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.380
I'd been waiting for it.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.280
So,

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.380
um,

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.640
zero intensity,

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.820
the author of PI awaitable commented says,

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.120
Hey,

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.780
author of PI awaitable here.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.100
Thanks for showcasing.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:51.740
You were right.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.980
The PEP didn't get published with a number.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.280
I was working with Peter Victor on it,

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.680
and we only got as far as a discussion thread,

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.680
but unfortunately something that only uses the public API,

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.940
doesn't make a strong proposal.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.900
So the draft got scrapped and turned into documentation.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.440
The plan is to integrate it into CPython sometime in the future,

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.940
depending on how much maintenance needs,

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.920
which hopefully should not be that much.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.380
Spoken as a true maintainer right there.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.320
Um,

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.300
Brian,

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:20.300
Brian,

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.960
let's talk web browsers real quick.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.020
So we've got Vivaldi,

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.260
which is what I'm using.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.840
Obviously Firefox is,

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.120
uh,

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.060
well known.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.580
people use Chrome for some reason still these days.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.540
I don't understand it,

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:35.820
but

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:39.520
that it still is like,

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.760
let me run spyware and type into it.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.040
Okay.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.520
Um,

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.720
there's Safari,

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.360
there's edge,

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.260
there's a bunch of options,

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:46.500
right?

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:46.940
Brave.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.140
So on,

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.600
but there's this new project that I came across called Lady Bird,

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.140
which is pretty interesting.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.220
Interesting here.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:54.900
Uh,

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.880
welcome to Lady Bird,

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.580
a truly independent web browser.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.800
We're building a brand new browser from scratch,

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.980
backed by a nonprofit.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.660
That's kind of interesting,

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.060
isn't it?

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.180
Kind of look go scroll to the top again.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.100
Isn't that the,

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.020
isn't that the meta logo or no,

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.520
it's not meta.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.480
It does look,

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.420
it does look a little bit like it,

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.100
but it's,

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:15.740
it's not,

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.120
I think it's supposed to look like a bird with,

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.560
I don't know.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:19.800
It's,

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.340
it's similar,

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:20.780
but it's not,

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:21.300
it's not meta.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:21.680
Okay.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.320
It's not meta.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.880
So it's an open source and open source project that has six full-time

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.300
developers working on it.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.900
And they expect to ship in 2026,

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.320
which is a lot of work,

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:34.200
but you know,

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.180
web browsers are basically operating systems these days,

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.560
but it's pretty interesting actually.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.060
So there's a newsletter you can sign up for.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.080
There's an FAQ.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.200
Uh,

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.960
they have sponsors getting,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.500
you know,

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.420
a decent amount of money.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.060
Um,

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.180
but yeah,

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:48.800
what does it mean?

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.520
Where's it come from?

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.220
And so on.

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.380
So I didn't,

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:51.720
I just,

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.520
I ran across that and thought that was interesting.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.080
Yeah.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:54.140
Yeah.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.860
Uh,

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.800
Jay out there in the audience says,

00:39:59.800 --> 00:39:59.940
Hey,

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.360
you're going to buy me a ticket for this,

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:01.760
uh,

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.740
code in the castle.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.020
Yeah,

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:03.420
we'll see.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:03.940
We'll see.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.040
Wait,

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.580
you're not buying me a ticket.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.240
Well,

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.380
get yourself to Germany and then it's,

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.040
or Austria.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.640
And it's a short little trip on down.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.080
Okay.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.020
Just across the Alps there.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:16.520
Okay.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:16.540
Okay.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.160
Next one.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.940
Someone asked us about like,

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.480
so sorry,

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.860
I forgot to write down the name.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.140
When I,

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.400
I wrote down this note says,

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:24.600
Hey,

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.860
I'm interested in your video.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.160
We talked about,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.600
I can't remember what we talked about,

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.540
but some,

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.280
maybe the new microphone or something.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:31.480
I said,

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:31.620
Hey,

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.240
I'm also interested in your video recording setup.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.080
And would that be cool as an extra?

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:37.840
Okay.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.820
So sure.

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:39.140
I'll,

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.840
I'll give people a rundown on this and Brian,

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.960
you can chime in on yours.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.460
I record all of the talk Python courses these days with OBS,

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.700
OBS studio,

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.480
which is awesome.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.420
It lets you basically record your screen,

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.300
record your face,

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.300
set up multiple scenes,

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.260
do green screens,

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:57.200
picture and picture with the background cut out.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.700
So you're just a little floating human in the bottom of some piece of

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.020
software.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.100
This is free.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:03.700
You can download it,

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.200
runs on all the things I encourage people to contribute,

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.000
donate to it.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.880
Like if you really use this a lot,

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.540
they have,

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.240
I said,

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.500
they have a Patreon thing.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.640
So I support them on Patreon,

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.640
but this is really nice for recording,

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.600
setting things up.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.380
And then controlling it with my steam deck,

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.560
stream deck rather.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.220
This is a really cool little bit of software that lets you change the

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:24.500
lighting,

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.720
change what's shown,

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.480
stop,

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:26.780
start,

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:27.180
pause,

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:27.600
et cetera.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.040
Also have,

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.680
for some reason,

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:35.520
the product page for the Elgato key light says that their store is

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.180
undergoing maintenance,

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.560
but the rest of the website is up.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.580
So they,

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:39.700
they point over here.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.080
So I can show you at least on Amazon,

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:45.440
I've got some cool Elgato key lights that can control with the stream deck

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.320
and multicolor,

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.640
and stuff.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.240
That's really fun.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.820
And then finally edit all of this with DaVinci resolve.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.260
DaVinci resolve is super fun software.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.160
They use it for a lot of the,

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.320
the Marvel movies,

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.300
I believe they use it for Spider-Man.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.300
So it's,

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.660
it's kind of intense.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.660
If you open up,

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:06.880
you're like,

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.340
what am I supposed to do with this?

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.320
But if you just stay in the little edit,

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.940
edit section with the timeline,

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.900
then it's,

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.800
it's pretty manageable and pretty nice to use.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.900
So that's also free.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:18.780
So that's,

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.640
that's what I'm doing these days.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.520
Cool.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.340
Yeah.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.600
I'm,

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.440
I'm doing a lot of that.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.480
I want to switch to,

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.940
I want to try the open.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.920
OBS.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.700
OBS.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:31.560
I'm,

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.140
I'm currently using Camtasia for recording stuff,

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.140
not for this show,

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.800
but for courses and stuff.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.480
I use Camtasia.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.220
The,

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.560
and Camtasia is oddly,

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.200
it works better on windows than it does on Mac because you can export

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:43.820
multiple.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.900
Is that is actually something I'm looking for in a Mac is,

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.160
is I want to be able to record everything in one project and then export

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.960
multiple videos from one project.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.720
And you can't do that with Camtasia.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.120
I don't think you can do that with,

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.220
with this,

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:00.900
that other.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.740
Da Vinci.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.100
But maybe you can,

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.180
that I just don't know how,

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.040
but anyway.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.740
Yeah.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:07.940
Yeah.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.700
I have all,

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.680
I have maybe a hundred videos for some courses and they're all in like one

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.520
project in Da Vinci.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.280
It's pretty nice.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.260
Also loves,

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.460
I'm using stream deck.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.200
I love stream deck.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:16.680
Um,

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.640
and the key lights are great.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.900
The one thing that you didn't mention was what camera you're using.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.240
Oh yeah.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.020
I'm using,

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.880
I've used a whole bunch.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.920
So this is not a strong recommendation,

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.940
but I'm using the Elgato.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.420
She can't click that thing.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.340
The,

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:35.740
uh,

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.280
the Elgato.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.000
What is it called?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.340
Face cam pro.

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.120
That's what it's called,

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.200
which is like a 4k camera.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:45.880
camera.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.080
That's pretty good.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:47.640
Yeah.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.120
It's pretty good.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:48.340
Yeah.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:48.920
It's pretty good.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.620
The color is a little bit off.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.140
Like it's hard to get just real natural colors.

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.540
Um,

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.080
I'm using the Logitech Logi,

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.300
a little tiny camera,

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.340
which is decent.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.660
I think I used that before and it's also real nice.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:00.860
Yeah.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.700
Yeah.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.980
But it'd be fun if I tried to try this other one.

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.920
And also so that we looked a little more similar.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.300
I'm,

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.520
I'm usually showing up lighter than you might be a lighting thing,

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.120
but anyway.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:13.680
Yeah.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:13.780
Yeah.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:14.180
Yeah.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:14.300
Yeah,

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:14.640
for sure.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.400
Uh,

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:16.840
let's see.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.300
Also just to round this out for the live streams,

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.440
we use stream yard.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.120
Oh yeah.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.260
We've been happy with that.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:23.680
Yeah.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.540
Stream yard is really good.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:24.940
Really good.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.840
And Jay Miller out there says,

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.980
if you're doing both recording and streaming,

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.360
I recommend Ecamm,

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.280
massive fan.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.060
They built zoom stream support,

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:34.540
which is,

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:34.860
yeah,

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.480
Jay does some cool live streaming as well.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:36.760
So,

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.280
all right.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.200
That was actually a kind of a long winded answer,

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.280
but that's what we're doing folks.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.660
For those of you who aren't interested.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.460
Yeah.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.740
Anything else?

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.040
Are we up to the joke?

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.900
I am ready to tell a joke.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.200
And now this joke has no graphic,

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.700
no,

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:52.300
uh,

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.420
no graphic,

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:54.840
but I thought we'd put just for the,

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.180
the live stream here.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.100
I would put a,

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.100
a picture of a really nice data center.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.300
So people can appreciate their code running in and like an awesome place

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:03.500
here.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.300
Okay.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.860
Yeah.

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.020
It's terrible.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:08.600
Okay.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.400
It's that it's a really bad,

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.280
a really bad looking,

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:13.760
uh,

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.520
like a place there.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.240
So,

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:15.640
uh,

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:15.900
here's,

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:16.540
here's the joke.

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.260
This is like,

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:17.720
um,

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:20.400
like a alcoholic synonymous meeting type of thing,

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.780
which alcoholism is not funny,

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.760
but make you fun of DevOps is.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.540
So let's do it in that star,

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:27.680
right?

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.200
This comes to this joke is,

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:29.540
uh,

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:30.440
adapted from a joke,

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:30.940
blaze,

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:31.340
uh,

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.020
wrote and said in.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.780
So this is the DevOps support group.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.160
Are you ready,

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:35.400
Brian?

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:35.880
Yeah.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.800
Hi,

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.760
my name is Bob group.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.280
Hi,

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:40.840
Bob.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.040
It's been 42 days since I last SSH into production.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.800
Applause from the group,

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.700
but only four days since I actually took down the website.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.820
Someone in the back.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:51.080
Oh,

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:51.520
Bob.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.180
Oh,

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:52.440
Bob.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.360
Yeah.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.540
Uh,

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.400
that's a,

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.460
that's funny.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.100
Yeah.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:00.900
It's a good one.

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.780
Yeah.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.020
You don't want to be the one who took down the website.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:05.720
Wow.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.760
If he didn't SSH into production.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.300
Oh,

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:08.460
well,

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.640
he must've shipped a bad Ansible script or something.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.080
I don't know.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.260
Use the,

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:12.620
like,

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:12.900
uh,

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.740
I knew the last time I took down the website inadvertent,

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.000
that was completely out of the blue.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:17.200
I'm like,

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.420
what in the world is happening?

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:22.980
Was I was using the walrus operator and Python,

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:23.340
the,

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.120
it was a while ago.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:24.720
Python three,

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.840
seven was running on the server.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.160
And I didn't use the walrus operator on the website code.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.000
I use it on a,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.320
like a utility thing,

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:37.320
but the script was collected in a subsection where the web framework scanned for

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.960
routes for the framework.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.720
And as it tried to parse the walrus code to see if it could add it to the website,

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.300
it took down the website instead.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.000
It couldn't start.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.840
Oh no.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.660
Yeah.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.640
Yeah.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.160
Anyway.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.360
Oh,

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:51.640
Bob.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.560
Oh,

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:52.880
Bob.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.420
Don't be Bob.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.400
Stay on top of stuff with Python bytes.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.800
Get all the latest things.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.820
Don't be Bob.

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.220
Unless your name is Bob.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:02.980
Then you be Bob.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.040
Don't be that Bob.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.280
Don't be that Bob.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.160
Exactly.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.820
All right.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.220
Well,

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:12.680
thank you everyone for being here and sending in all the stuff.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.380
A lot of fun,

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:13.580
Brian.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:14.120
See you later.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:14.920
Thanks a lot.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.100
Bye.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.240
Thank you.
