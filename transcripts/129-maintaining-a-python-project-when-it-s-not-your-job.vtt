00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds. This is episode


00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.600
129 recorded live from PyCon


00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:19.040
Excellent excellent, and I'm Michael Kennedy and I'm Brian Okken and we are Paul and Barry


00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.160
Yeah, Paul Everett Barry Warsaw. Thank you guys for joining us here for this live event


00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.480
It's gonna be a lot of fun our pleasure


00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.640
- Yeah, and also want to say thank you to DigitalOcean


00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.520
for sponsoring this episode as well.


00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.320
Check them out at pythonbytes.fm/digitalocean.


00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.600
More on that later.


00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.240
Right now, I think we're gonna kick it off


00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.960
with our first item, and I'm gonna let Brian do that.


00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.120
- So I'm gonna start with actually a talk


00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.280
that was given yesterday, easy research.


00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.560
Hynek, and also because I like mispronouncing his name,


00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.960
Hynek, and I'm not gonna try the last name,


00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.680
did a talk called Maintaining a Python Project


00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.200
When It's Not Your Job.


00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.280
And this is really important to me


00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.860
because I'm starting to do some projects


00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.320
and I'm pushing out on open source projects


00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.000
and I'm a little scared of that,


00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.640
how much work that's gonna add to my life.


00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.120
But it has a whole bunch of great tips in here.


00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.560
Along with the talk, he posted an article


00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.160
with a lot of the great information,


00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.120
goes through like setting up the development


00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.280
and code of conduct for a project


00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.920
so that people can get started and help you out.


00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.580
Even walks through like making sure


00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.120
you set up continuous integration on it,


00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.400
how to get your testing using talks as a local CI server,


00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.240
works great.


00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.680
And then even goes through like making sure


00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.540
that your documentation is up to speed,


00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.800
up to snuff with Sphinx,


00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.520
handling pull requests from people,


00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.820
how do you deal with that?


00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.400
Building a community of maintainers


00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.240
so that you're not overburdened


00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.480
and how to do releases and deal with that.


00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.040
And so it's pretty much the gamut


00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.200
of how to automate most of the work


00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.600
so that you're not burned out from the start.


00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.440
So I like that.


00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.440
So thanks, Hynek.


00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.520
- Yeah, you know, that's definitely an interesting challenge


00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.400
Like, you have all these projects that you want to build,


00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.800
but I don't know about you, but I've actually said,


00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.200
this is cool, I'm gonna put it on GitHub,


00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.480
but I'm not gonna talk about it


00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.600
because I don't wanna own it as a puppy.


00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.600
It's cool, I need it, if people find it, that's great,


00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.240
but you know, it's a challenge, right?


00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.120
So it's really cool that he put that talk together.


00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.320
- All right, I'm gonna talk about


00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.760
what Barry and I talked about here yesterday, Python 1994.


00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.360
It's a talk that we do a lot,


00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.760
and it's a lot of fun in a cave drawings kind of way.


00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.180
But yesterday was a lot of fun,


00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.460
And I think it was because we didn't get to talk as long.


00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.660
And so we had to leave out all the crap


00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.780
and get straight to the point.


00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.980
And part of the point is in 1994,


00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.180
which was 25 years ago, was the first Python event.


00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.320
We were at it.


00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.980
It was colossal.


00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.820
- 20 people.


00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.920
- And we talk about how things looked then,


00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.820
what it felt like.


00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.220
Did we know it would be like this?


00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.180
Of course we knew it would be like this.


00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.660
- Yep, I knew that 25 years later we'd have 3,500 people.


00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.740
the strategic plans work perfectly.


00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.580
And we talk a little bit about a certain phrase


00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.940
that we were uttering back at that time.


00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.300
What if Guido got hit by a bus?


00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.380
- That would be bad.


00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.340
We like Guido.


00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.100
- It would still be bad.


00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.980
- Yeah, so that was definitely a topic of the first workshop


00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.140
and yeah, I don't know what to,


00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.860
more to say about that other than, you know,


00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.860
I think finding a way to keep Python as a project,


00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.080
but also the community, sustainable,


00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.420
has always been on our mind.


00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.540
And it's kind of led to, through the PSA,


00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.300
the Python software activity,


00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.720
all the way through the PSF, has always been,


00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.400
we want to keep this thing going.


00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.340
And I think it continues, not just for the last 25,


00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.300
but for the next 25 years.


00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.900
- And Barry will talk a little bit about what the answer is,


00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.860
which is just happening last year.


00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.640
But the part that's interesting to me about it


00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.400
is pretending that there's a point.


00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.740
And if there was a point to be pretended to,


00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.580
it would be, what did we do that kind of painted the road


00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.300
for the way things became?


00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.420
And one of the things that came up


00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.820
when we first did this two years ago is,


00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.540
Brett likes to say,


00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.420
God, I get this backwards every time, say it.


00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.460
- Come for the language, stay for the community.


00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.780
- Yeah, okay, that one.


00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.820
And why would you stay for the community?


00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.580
'Cause the Python community is awesome.


00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.060
Some of the communities back then were not,


00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.340
and we succeeded because of that.


00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.360
Why did we succeed of it?


00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.240
because Guido and we are kind and humane


00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.720
because Guido is kind and humane.


00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.760
So that's one of the original points to learn from that.


00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.080
But the other is we're kind of old


00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.780
and our story has been told


00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.160
and there is a next 25 years of Python and PyCon


00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
and it's your years


00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.720
and it's time for the next Python badasses to emerge.


00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.280
One of you listening here in the floor,


00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.920
one of you listening on their awesome podcast


00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.960
is going to be that next badass.


00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.280
- Yeah, so should I talk about


00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.140
the steering council a little bit?


00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.960
Okay, so probably everyone knows that,


00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.480
when was it, in July, June or July,


00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.920
Guido stepped down as the BDFL,


00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.400
which I think was actually kind of a good thing.


00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.120
I mean, I think it was good for Guido's own health.


00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.880
- It was abrupt and unexpected,


00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.480
but in the end, I think it was good, yeah.


00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.360
- Yeah, yeah, and you know,


00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.720
having gone through the process of the community


00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.560
deciding how they wanna be governed, right,


00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.360
So Guido said, "You guys figure it out."


00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.320
And I think the community did figure it out.


00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.200
We came up with a series of PEPs


00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.560
which all outlined different governance models,


00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.720
looked around at the open source landscape


00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.680
and saw how other communities,


00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.720
sort of maybe of Python size,


00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.320
but also smaller and bigger, organized themselves.


00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.120
And I think we came up with something


00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.640
that will work for us,


00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.080
but will also evolve as we kind of figure out


00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.080
how to govern the Python technical side of this world


00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.840
moving forward.


00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.360
So now we have a steering council of five people


00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.320
that are elected by the core developers.


00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.200
And if you want to be involved in that,


00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.080
become a core developer.


00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.260
Like everyone here can be a core developer.


00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.880
And we really encourage that.


00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.780
Except for Paul.


00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.040
- What I was impressed was not just the result you came to,


00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.480
but the way you got there.


00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.480
and conferred legitimacy on what could have been


00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.640
a controversial and somewhat nasty journey and destination.


00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.880
>> Yeah, I think that was really critical.


00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.520
That was an important point in,


00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.740
through the entire process,


00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.320
was how do we make sure that this is legitimate,


00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.640
that it represents the will of the core developers,


00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.800
which sort of represent the entire Python community?


00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.960
Because we're making decisions


00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.640
that will affect Python moving forward,


00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.640
I want to make sure that that is representative


00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.380
of all Python users.


00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.140
- I think it's super positive, and I think


00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.980
this is the first time that we've had to decide


00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.220
how to govern ourself.


00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.560
It was just, we kind of grew into it before.


00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.560
Is this like us moving out to go to college


00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.680
and getting our first apartment?


00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.720
Or, you know, what's the analogy here?


00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.560
- Yeah, well, we have to eat a lot of mac and cheese,


00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.900
I guess, first.


00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.140
- All right, cool, before we go on to the last item here,


00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.100
I just want to say thank you to DigitalOcean.


00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.980
I like to highlight stuff that they're doing cool


00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.480
every week on the show when they're sponsoring it.


00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.560
And right now, GitHub recently launched


00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.680
their GitHub Actions.


00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.840
Are you guys using GitHub Actions?


00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.720
Anyone out there to automate stuff when you do check-ins?


00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.600
It looks really cool.


00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.160
I haven't got to it yet, but definitely looking for it.


00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.040
So with DigitalOcean, you can get their GitHub project


00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.560
for GitHub Actions for DigitalOcean.


00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.960
And anytime you do a check-in, it can create VMs


00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.600
and droplets and spaces and all sorts of cool stuff.


00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.980
So if you're trying to automate things,


00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.280
look into GitHub Actions and do that with DigitalOcean.


00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.560
Check them out at pythonbytes.fm/digitalocean.


00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.520
Get $100 credit for new users, which is pretty cool.


00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520
All right, last item.


00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.880
That's the main one here that I wanna talk about


00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.840
is something called TextBlob.


00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.800
Sounds awesome, right?


00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.280
No, but it's really cool.


00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.360
So the two main text understanding libraries, I would say,


00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.320
were NLTK and spaCy.


00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.880
So those are pretty cool.


00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.640
This one is like a higher level library


00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.600
built on top of NLTK.


00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.960
So instead of just going and processing the text,


00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.000
You can do things like pull in some text and say,


00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.520
what are all the sentences?


00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.140
What are the words, the unique words in this document?


00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.680
What are the phrases or various sayings in there?


00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.080
And it'll find that it does things like lemonization.


00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.760
You know, if you want to search for goose,


00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.240
but the only keyword you have is geese,


00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.200
like a straightforward search engine's only gonna find,


00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.880
you know, nothing or just the gooses or whatever, geese.


00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.760
So, but so the geese, you know,


00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.600
it'll basically do that normalization automatically for you.


00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.160
a cinnamon analysis, all sorts of cool stuff.


00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.100
And there's a great article going through and analyzing a


00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.320
whole bunch of text and showing you how it works.


00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.740
So yeah, if you've got to do anything with text, Text Blob


00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.360
is pretty awesome.


00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.720
It seems like it's really quick and high level, unless


00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.680
you need to get really deep.


00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.240
So I'd probably start with that.


00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240
It's awesome.


00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.600
All right, well, that's it for our four items that we're


00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.520
going to have here.


00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.400
And since this is live, we wanted to give you all a


00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.560
chance to maybe ask some questions of these guys or


00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.000
throw a comment out there to get on the podcast or something


00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.500
like that.


00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.120
So you have to repeat it.


00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.280
It won't really be recorded because the mics don't


00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.780
pick it up.


00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.700
But just feel free to shout it out if you want.


00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.800
I'm curious from each of your perspectives,


00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.960
what do you get most out of coming to PyCon


00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.160
and conferences in general?


00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.200
Because Mike and Brian are content creators.


00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.400
Barry, you're a core developer.


00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.760
Paul's a developer.


00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.600
So I'm curious, what for you is the one or two things


00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.880
you get most out of coming to PyCon or conferences


00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.380
in general?


00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.920
Thanks, Jason.


00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.640
- Right here, Paul, left or right?


00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.800
- For work, we come not to sell, but to listen


00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.980
and to make the PyCharm team face the consequences


00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.820
of their decisions.


00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.140
(laughing)


00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.440
I specifically come, PyCon is my home and my family


00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.160
and this is joy factory of the nth degree for me.


00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.340
- Yeah, for me, it's definitely the people.


00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.880
It's friends that I've known for 25 years.


00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.480
It's new people that I get to meet


00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.480
And I find that the hallway track is, for me, the best,


00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.040
other than the sprints, which I also love,


00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.080
because it's just the synergy of ideas.


00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.640
You know, this person has a cool idea


00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.280
and they haven't connected with that person


00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.320
who also has a cool idea that goes together.


00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.640
And that, I think, is, you can't get that anywhere else.


00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.720
It doesn't happen online really as much.


00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.600
It just happens when you are face-to-face


00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.960
with 3,500 other people.


00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.360
I came to try to find sponsors for testing code.


00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.040
- Look how many.


00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.080
(laughing)


00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.200
- There's people that I recognize their faces


00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.880
from their like, their Twitter profiles


00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.900
or their GitHub or on their blog or something.


00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.080
But that, you know, I just interact with them


00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.000
mostly over text or a little 140 or 280,


00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.400
whatever we're up to now.


00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.400
And pull requests and things like that.


00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.960
And just being able to see people in person,


00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.080
even just, even for a few seconds to say,


00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.360
"Hey, you're that guy, yeah."


00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.840
And shake hands and say,


00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.920
"I appreciate what you're doing everywhere."


00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.600
It's an incredible experience and there's nothing like it.


00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.480
- Yeah, I feel kind of like Paul does.


00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.520
Like this is my geek holiday, right?


00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.240
Like go to vacation with my family somewhere away from tech


00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.800
but like this is like really special.


00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.440
And I just love, I come here to see all of you.


00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.840
You know, we have such great interactions online


00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.200
but you know, some of my dear friends,


00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.420
I only see them at these places, right?


00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.200
Like we connect through the internet


00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.860
but we don't actually get to be in the same place


00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.000
except for times like this.


00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.480
So that's what I get out of it.


00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.480
Just making those connections deeper and more real.


00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.840
Yeah, maybe another question or two if you guys got it.


00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.500
- Okay, you said that anybody can be a core developer,


00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.000
but don't I have to know C to be a core developer?


00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.840
- No.


00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.940
- Okay, maybe, can you expand on that a little bit?


00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.200
(laughing)


00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.140
- Think about it, so if you are a Python programmer,


00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.020
like the standard library has a lot of Python code in it,


00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.560
and you can be a Python programmer.


00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.520
- So helping support the standard library


00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.440
is considered being a core developer then?


00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.280
- Absolutely.


00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.280
Writing documentation can be considered a core developer.


00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.560
Writing bots that help our workflow on GitHub


00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.320
can be considered a core developer.


00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.700
I mean, like, expand your thinking


00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.380
about what it takes to be a core developer.


00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.500
There's a ton of things that help move Python,


00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.940
the project, forward,


00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.120
and it doesn't just require writing C code.


00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.960
- All right, I got one more for two of you guys


00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.800
around the end.


00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.840
You talked about 1994.


00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.500
I suspect it was a smaller group,


00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.740
smaller conference back then, little?


00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.620
In 1994, it was 20 people in a government room, a windowless room.


00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.620
No windows, yeah.


00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.660
It did have metal walls and you could throw magnets and they would stick to the wall.


00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.660
That's pretty cool.


00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.660
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.


00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.260
So when I walked into the convention hall, the expo hall today, the first day yesterday


00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:44.260
or two days ago, whatever it was, and I saw this, I felt like even from last year, there's


00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:49.160
a little more energy, there's a little more effort that all the presenters and companies


00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.140
are putting into the space.


00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.740
your perspective, how do you guys see that? Did you get that same feeling like Python's


00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.420
still growing and you know?


00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.940
It's definitely still growing. And I know, so I work for LinkedIn, and where we're seeing


00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:06.820
a lot of the growth, or probably most of the growth is in the data sciences, right? So


00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.940
like that's an entirely new community that has sort of come into Python. And I think


00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:19.100
that's, it's fantastic to see. The thing that I loved about Python in 1994 was how easy


00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.260
it is to understand, to read, and to write.


00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.100
- You could know all of it.


00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.020
- You could know all of it.


00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.980
And what I think that appeals to is a data scientist


00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.220
who may not be professional programmers.


00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.460
So Python is very approachable for them.


00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.020
And I think that that is, and you see that everywhere,


00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.820
right, in education, in the talks that we had this morning.


00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.820
Python appeals to occasional programmers


00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.020
and professional programmers.


00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.100
Small programs, one-off scripts, to running Instagram,


00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.180
right, like that is incredible.


00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.180
how many languages appeal to that broad of problem space


00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.720
and size and scalability?


00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.580
- I think that's actually key to the growth.


00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.200
You know, my visualization for that is to think of Python


00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.920
as a full spectrum language.


00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.880
I can start easy and I don't have to know


00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.980
all the complicated stuff, but you don't outgrow it.


00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.540
Like, I could start easy with VB6,


00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.420
but then it stops real quick.


00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.500
Or I could start with C++ and build something awesome,


00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.800
but it starts real hard, right?


00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.900
But Python kind of goes that full spectrum.


00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.300
You said you could learn all of it in 1994.


00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.260
You could also meet all of the people in 1994.


00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.300
And one of the things we mentioned yesterday,


00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.180
Spam 2, the conferences were called Spam 1, Spam 2,


00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.480
et cetera, Spam 2 in Menlo Park.


00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.260
There were two guys there from the Digital Library Project.


00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.860
Anyone know what that project was later renamed to?


00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.260
I'll give you a hint, you could probably Google it.


00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.820
So it's probably neat that it was written


00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.300
in Python at that time.


00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.500
But kind of comparing that to now,


00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.180
One of the fun things, I work for a company


00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.380
that makes tools for programming languages.


00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.220
I'm an advocate, we have a Slack channel,


00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.740
sitting there we talk, bleep to each other.


00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.180
How satisfying is it for me,


00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.860
every time a Stack Overflow survey comes out,


00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.900
and my language is number one,


00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.940
I paste that URL, it's like, bam!


00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.260
What y'all got to say about that?


00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.660
- Yeah, that's pretty awesome, yeah, go for it.


00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.900
- So I have a question for Barry and Paul.


00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.100
So that meeting in 1994,


00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.020
was that where the Python secret underground was born?


00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.340
Or did that come later?


00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.860
- Yeah, we're not allowed to talk about that.


00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.820
(laughing)


00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.380
- First rule of the secret underground


00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.220
is you don't talk about the secret underground.


00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.140
- If we do talk, it's in Dutch, so.


00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.140
(laughing)


00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.700
- The PSU definitely does not exist.


00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.620
(laughing)


00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.660
- All right, Brian, is it time for a joke?


00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.940
- Yeah, let's do the joke.


00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.020
- Yeah, I've adapted this one.


00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.280
I'll see what you all think.


00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.980
So you've heard the thing of sort of like randomness


00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.780
about if you put a million monkeys in front of a keyboard,


00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.900
they're gonna write Shakespeare or something.


00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.780
Well, if you put a million monkeys


00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.840
