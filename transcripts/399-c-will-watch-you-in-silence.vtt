00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.780
Hello, everybody. Hello, Michael.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.780
Hey there.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:10.460
We really should have kicked off the shift to Monday next week instead of this week,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.840
because this week's a holiday. We're on Tuesday.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.160
It was a leap Monday.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.820
Yeah.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.760
Or the reverse of that or something. Yes.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.820
Okay. So next week we'll be on Monday.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.520
But it's good to be here. Should we kick it off?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.760
Let's kick it off.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.460
All right.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.320
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to earbuds.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.820
This is episode 399, recorded September 3rd, 2024.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.160
And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.800
And I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.500
I always have to check the date because I write down in the notes what the date is.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.520
But sometimes I start the notes a day early and I get the date wrong.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.320
But yeah, it is September 3rd.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.460

But let's get on with the show.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.060
Michael, what would you like to start with?

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.800
I would like to talk about virtual environments.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.860
Cool.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.320
How about that?

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.800
Yeah.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.320
Actually, this is a really fun topic.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.080
This comes from Henick.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.140
He wrote yesterday an article.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.900
I feel like this is one of the things you write where it's like, all right, I'll write it down.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.840
You keep asking me.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.380
I'll write it down so we can just have it there to point at.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.260
And that article is entitled, Why I Still Use Python Virtual Environments in Docker.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:25.860
I was checking out this thing that Henick wrote about using UV and its project management features inside of Docker containers.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.360
And there's a bunch of funkiness.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.320
If you look at his article, he links over to a GitHub post, GitHub issue, I guess.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.040
And there it's, you know, we've got Henick jumping in.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.560
You've got Sebastian from FastAPI jumping in.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.860
You know, there's like a bunch of pretty significant folks going, almost a little more help for us Docker people.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:01.140
So as I've talked about before, Python bytes and all the talk Python things and other infrastructures running in Docker these days, it's glorious.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.740
We've got one big server with eight CPUs and 17 different multi-tier apps running on.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.240
It's fantastic.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.640
And I happened to use this as well.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.680
And I just thought it was really interesting to hear Henick's recommendations and mostly on, on the whys.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.840
Okay.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:31.900
Because with Docker, the Python in the Docker container is really only going to be used for the particular app that's being shipped.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.860
Like usually put just one thing into a Docker container, one app.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.360
And if you need two apps, you often run two Docker containers.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.560
So why, why not just blast on the, the built-in Python or something along those lines, right?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.100
Yeah.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.500
You're not trying to isolate from anything.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.340
So yeah, exactly.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.360
Well, I can just hear Henick now going, yes, but let me write this down.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.420
So I, let's flip over to omnivore app because that's what you should be using.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.800
If you do long form reading and note-taking omnivores app.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.560
And this is great for notes.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.740
This is why I still use this, right?

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.680
Like what's going on here?

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:21.660
Says as an overarching theme, my goal, Henick's, is not mindlessly follow some best practices that add complexity for questionable payoffs.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:31.860
Because a big tech developer advocates, so at a conference, but to spend a lot of time thinking about what secondary effects things that you do.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:41.200
And it's not so much about how many keys you got to press, but how hard is it to reason about what's going to happen as a consequence of a particular setup, you know?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.040
Okay.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.800
Yeah.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.940
So that's, that's fair.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.320
And basically, this is, look, people understand virtual environments really, really well.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.820
It's the whole goal of virtual environments is to hold a single application.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:02.520
If I tell you in documentation or a meeting or a walk or a course or whatever, Hey, what we're deploying is a virtual environment.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.800
You're like, ah, I know what that is.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.100
That's pretty straightforward.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.080
And this is Henick's words.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.520
It's the closest thing that we have to an enclosed standardized and well-understood application build artifact in Python.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:24.080
The stretch, he says, but he thinks of virtual environments as the result of linking a dynamic binary in compiled languages, which is pretty interesting.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.680
Hmm.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680
Kind of.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.700
Yeah, I can see the analogy.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.720
Yeah, exactly.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.160
I do too.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.580
Totally.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.980
So you've got your Python source code.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.300
You've got your list of dependencies.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.720
That's kind of like your statically linked libraries in your, in your compiler.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:46.240
And then what you get out is the actual libraries, not a list of names and your code, potentially QIC files, pre-compiled, et cetera, and so on.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.200
So I think that makes a ton of sense.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.740
It certainly seems that way to me.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.360
And it's good to use the same tools and primitives that you have in development and in production.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.740
So they're not vastly different.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.800
And in development, you typically use virtual environments.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.120
So why not in production?

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.040
Right.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.960
Yeah.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.820
Moreover, import complexity debugging says, did you know this?

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.440
You maybe know this.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.420
I didn't know this actually.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:29.140
If you pass dash capital I to Python, then it limits where the imports come from and will only import from either the standard library or the virtual environment and nothing else.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:40.820
As opposed to say falling back to, well, it's not in the virtual environment, so it's in the Python path or so it's in the --user version or whatever.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.180
Right.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.000
That's kind of nice.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.020
And then finally, as a bonus says, I'll have no fury like how I feel about pip install --user.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.420
So, you know, anyway, it's, it's an interesting thing.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:09.880
You can check this out and I follow the same philosophy, but I didn't in my mind have it as crystallized as what Hennig did.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.140
So I really like this, this take on it.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.060
And people who get this podcast, visit the website or even just get the MP3.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.000
All that is happening through a virtual environment running Python 312 in a Docker container.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.600
How about that?

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.000
That's pretty cool.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.980
It is pretty cool.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.980
It is.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.380
It is.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.600
But I'm not trying to convince you to do anything.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.520
Kind of is.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.980
But, but don't tell me that I'm wrong.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.060
Yeah, sure.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.480
Okay.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.300
I think it's the vibes there.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:40.740
Anyway.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.440
Well, then people can check that out.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.120
Nice.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.540
I want to talk about the developer survey.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.660
This is done by the PSF and JetBrains.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.160
And this is still not on the screen.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.920
There we go.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.280
There you go.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.880
The developer survey with, it's funny.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.220
Developer S is on the next line.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:06.680
That's funny.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.480
Anyway.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:07.500
Anyway.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.900
2023.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.080
It's 2024.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.960
What's going on?

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.200
Well, they do this kind of at the end.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.620
It's from November of 2023 to February of 2024 is when they're collecting it.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.080
So, and then they analyze it and come up with this cool thing.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.320
And so that's why we get it a few months later, which now we're ready.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.980
So, anyway, let's look at some of the cool results.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.000
So, this is pretty neat.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.580
They've got the contents broken out into all sorts of stuff.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.940
Python versions, data science.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.340
There's a lot of data science stuff in here now.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.520
But there's a bunch of stuff I thought was interesting.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:47.460
We've got 85% of the survey respondents use Python as their main language versus secondary.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.860
Hey, Brian, before we go on, I have not seen this at all.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.100
I didn't even know they were out.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.960
Oh, really?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.800
Whatever I say is first reactions.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.460
I'm loving it.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.820
I'm getting new experience at this time.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.480
Cool.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.780
And, well, did you submit the survey?

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.040
Yeah, I filled it out a long time ago.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.320
I believe those numbers, the 85% main, 15% secondary, is identical to last year.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.760
I can't remember for sure, but it's very, very close.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.540
It's interesting.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.180
I can't.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.280
A lot of the results, they show what the last year's results were, but some of them, they don't.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.040
They're just highlighted.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.760
So, maybe you can probably get the data or something.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.080
Anyway.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:35.980
The Python usage with other languages, I thought it was interesting that the JavaScript and HTML is down a little bit, just a little bit.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.860
It was 37%.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.900
JavaScript's 37% in 2022, and this time it's 35.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.980
HTML was 36, now 32.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.520
So, it's gone down a little bit.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.460
Russ.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:49.980
Super interesting.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.380
You wonder if, is that an actual decrease in use of HTML and JavaScript?

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:04.800
Are there more people coming into Python, like on the data science side, that don't care about HTML and CSS and JavaScript?

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.820
Maybe they just, maybe it's being diluted, but not lessened, or maybe it is less.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.220
I don't know.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.080
Yeah, I don't think it's lessened.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.780
I think it's just more people are using Python.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:22.760
And Paul Everett notes that the drop in HTML and JavaScript might be, might show that data science is increasing its share of Python.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.980
And I think that's true.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:33.620
The machine learning and data science is taking, there's more people coming into that than other, than web development, I guess.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.960
So, I think that's there.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.980
The Rust was interesting, because we talk about Python and Rust a lot.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:49.660
And still, it's increased, but it's still 7% of the respondents are using Rust also.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.840
But those 7% are doing some cool stuff.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.560
So, go Rust.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.760
Anyway, usage with other languages, primary versus secondary.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.540
Yeah, it's no surprises.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.920
JavaScript, HTML, SQL, Bash, C++, down at the bottom.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.400
Let's see.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.320
Skip down a little bit.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:20.720
How long, this is interesting, especially when, for people like you and me that train other people and teach other people stuff,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:26.460
is to remember that a lot of people have only been using Python for a little while.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.540
There's 25% less than a year.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:39.540
But if you combine the less than a year and one to two years, it's like 40% have been using it less than two years.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:45.560
So, you really can't assume that people know a lot of the Python history and stuff like that.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.180
So, the other thing that was interesting is absolutely new to coding.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.360
Even if it's not Python, that's similar.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.160
It's like 50% of the population is under two years.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:02.240
Or at least of the survey respondents.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.980
But I would have expected the survey respondents to be more edged towards experienced folks, myself.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.180
Exactly.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:08.620
Yeah.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:08.680
Yeah.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:15.620
37% Python developers reported contributing to open source.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.700
That's awesome.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.640
In the last year, that's actually higher than I would have expected.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.760
But that might be, again, the population of survey respondents.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.980
But, yeah.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.760
Interesting.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.980
Most contributions are in code.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.280
77%.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.880
38% documentation.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.560
Only 33 tests.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.800
That's a bummer.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.460
We got to bring the tests up a bit.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.820
I don't know what this is.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.800
34% of Python developers report practicing collaborative development.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.580
That, like, pair programming and stuff like that.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.600
Maybe.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.580
I don't know.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.560
Let's see.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.880
Oh, look at this.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.000
Favorite Python-related resources.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.300
I think this is new this year.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.100
I've got YouTube channels, podcasts, blogs.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.300
Of the podcasts, we've got Talk Python To Me.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:06.840
Congrats.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.960
It's not ordered.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.580
It's just the top, I guess.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.740
But I think it might be ordered.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.040
Talk Python To Me.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.960
Lex Friedman.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.840
It's a good one.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.240
Real Python people.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.280
Django Chat.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.160
I love those guys.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.540
Core.py.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.780
Python Bytes.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.400
And then Python Test.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.600
I was not expecting to have that show up.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.200
That's awesome.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.860
It is awesome.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.600
We've got three podcasts in that list.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.560
That's incredible.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.860
But I probably, I changed, just this last weekend,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.160
I changed Python Test back to testing code.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.880
Just right-click on the page, Brian,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.920
and say edit, just inspect, and then edit HTML,

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.100
and it'll be fine.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.100
Yeah.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.920
I don't know how to save it after that,

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.500
but it'll look fine for a little while.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.700
Well, yeah.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.960
So if you click on it, it goes to Python Test,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.360
and you can click on testing code at that point.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.880
So let's just, I guess I'll leave it at that.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.220
I'm not changing it again.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.700
It's sticking to testing code for a while.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.060
Anyway, okay.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.140
Do you use it for work or fun?

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.700
51%.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.760
Use it for both work and personal.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.500
So that's fun.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.380
Only 21% for just for work, which is cool,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:24.420
because Python is so fun, you should do it at home also, I guess.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.000
The use of programming, you see these problems at home,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.520
you're like, that has to be fixed.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.600
There will be some code written that will fix this problem,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.460
whatever it is.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:34.880
Yeah.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.220
They added, no, what you use Python for,

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.620
they've added some categories.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.900
So it's hard to compare the numbers year over year,

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.240
because there's new categories.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.040
Like, for instance, data analysis is still at the top at 44%,

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.700
but it was 51 last year.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.260
But there's also data engineering and academic research

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.660
and ML Ops added, and they're probably all-

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.380
And data visualization, yeah.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:00.760
Yeah.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.620
So, and, oh yeah, design data visualization.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.980
Those are all, it's like tons of,

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.920
that's what people are using Python.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.200
So we could rename the podcast,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.680
the language that uses,

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.060
that people use data analysis for,

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.720
podcast or something, I don't know.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.480
Anyway.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.600
Where's testing?

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.200
I think testing's in.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.920
Oh, testing has gone down to 23%.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.920
It's probably all.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.820
We have so many users now,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.480
we don't need to test as much, they can do it.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.500
I think it's the data analysis people.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.380
I don't think they test it.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:40.680
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.780
Well, when you're exploring data,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.840
you don't need to write tests.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.720
It's not, you're not going to keep it.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.060
Throw it away anyway.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.920
Yeah.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.020
Your data doesn't have to actually be right.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.720
It could, it could be wrong.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.420
You're just like making decisions for the country based on it,

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.580
but you know, whatever.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:15:59.600
Okay.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:15:59.600
Okay.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:15:59.920
Anyway,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.560
a whole bunch of fun stuff through here.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.000
Oh,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.700
there's a whole bunch of stuff around doc data analysis stuff that I didn't

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.420
really dig into,

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.060
but I did think that the Python version was interesting.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.100
there's still Python two people around.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.660
There's 6% of the people using Python two,

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.180
which is,

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.540
I don't know why,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.240
but anyway,

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.620
two will not die.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.600
The,

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.720
and I think that's pretty much,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.500
it's got,

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.220
we went down 1% over last year.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:31.640
So that,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.940
I guess we're making progress.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.920
That long tail will take a while.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.420
of the other versions of the Python three looks like three 10,

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:39.940
three 11,

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.200
three 12 are the tops,

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.960
which is what you'd expect,

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.440
I guess.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.960
So it's good.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.520
75,

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.540
almost 75% use the last,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.580
last three versions.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.540
So this is great.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.540
And Python.org.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.720
So most,

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.280
most,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.900
most used way to install.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.420
So next year,

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.580
we'll see about UV Python install.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.840
That's another one.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.680
that's because they had.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.320
Oh,

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:06.780
that's true.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.500
And some others,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:07.760
right?

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.520
Yeah.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.000
I might have the up to add that.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.920
I think that we'll probably see that with,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.480
there was like virtual environment stuff somewhere.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.960
Lost.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.360
Can we look at web frameworks real quick?

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.500
I know you just scroll by them.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.060
Web frameworks,

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.720
Flask,

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.600
Django requests,

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.240
FastAPI.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.140
Still don't know how these fit together.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.180
It's like,

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.200
what language do you use?

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.240
C++ or CSS?

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:28.560
Like,

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.060
uh,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.700
yeah,

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.140
I don't know.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:31.840
I don't know the question.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.040
So I'm going to say that because we have Flask and Django.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.220
We also have HTTPX,

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.460
which is a client.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.940
It's like,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.440
yeah,

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.620
Firefox or Flask.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:40.940
It's like,

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.180
huh?

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.000
Interesting.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.400
Anyway,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:42.960
well,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.020
it's like requests,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.260
uh,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.180
requests as well.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:45.540
Yeah.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:45.660
Yeah.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.100
I think it's wet in a web category,

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:48.760
but if they feel,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.300
uh,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:49.900
convoluted,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.460
but nonetheless,

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.620
Flask,

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.720
Django and FastAPI.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.120
I think it is super interesting.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:01.860
I think Flask is gaining a lot of momentum for a second wind or fifth wind or however many winds it's had plus one.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:08.640
It seems like it's getting a lot of momentum these days because I feel like it had fallen a little bit,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.260
certainly realized if the FastAPI.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.320
So that's interesting.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.060
Well,

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.480
David Lord's been doing a bunch of cool work on it and other people of,

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:15.740
uh,

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.720
cleaning it up and,

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.500
uh,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.340
getting rid of some of the old stuff.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.980
So I had him on talk Python to talk about,

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.280
uh,

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.180
the state of Flask and palettes in 2024.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.640
Maybe that's where I got my information from.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.560
I just listened to that.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.180
Like last week.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:29.540
Did you?

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:29.780
Oh,

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.040
nice.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:30.720
Good episode.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.160
Uh,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.380
test frameworks,

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.440
pytest at the top,

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.340
52%.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:35.840
Yay.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.280
Um,

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.140
built in default still carries a lot of weight there though.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.560
Unit test.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:41.840
Yeah.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.740
25%.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.300
2% for nose.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.500
That must be well,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.680
those Python two people using nose still.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.140
Maybe.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.020
I don't know.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.800
Same,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.460
same with this,

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.240
like hypothesis.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.520
That's,

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.520
and mock.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.780
Those can be used with any of these things.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.740
but yeah.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.940
Um,

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:58.280
yeah,

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:58.640
exactly.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.900
And I,

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.580
I would like to see the numbers from last year.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.340
I can't remember.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.380
I'll look those up.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.260
Um,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.100
I'm hoping that okay is in the list.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.000
We haven't talked about that,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.820
but we'll try to get okay at 2% by in a couple of years.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.380
Um,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.040
yeah.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.480
More,

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.080
more fun stuff for data analysis,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.580
whatever date,

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.640
lots of data science,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.840
half of its data science,

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.340
but anyway,

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.660
a fun survey.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.500
It's good to check out.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.380
And,

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:24.700
uh,

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.760
especially look at,

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.760
look around November.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.180
Then,

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.700
uh,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:27.940
we'll,

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.580
we'll bug you in a couple months to go take the survey for next time.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.060
So,

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.480
yep.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.540
I always really look forward to this.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.200
It's,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.440
it's insightful.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.340
Yeah.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.540
All right.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.460
All right.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.140
Well,

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.060
previously,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:45.660
Brian,

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.240
remember you talked,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.860
you had an article that you covered that was like,

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.380
I done for Excel was not what I wanted it to be or something like that.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:54.620
right?

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:54.980
Like,

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.300
yeah,

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.660
I wanted a replacement for VBA.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.100
And what I got was advanced functions and cells,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:01.880
or I don't know,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.220
one of them times of things.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.700
And one of the limitations,

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.980
several of the limitations were somewhat annoying.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.420
One limitation was,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:10.980
well,

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:10.980
well,

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:19.880
you can pip install or you can import third party things from this shorthand list of a couple of them that are common,

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.080
like NumPy and pandas.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.680
That might make sense.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.080
And if it's not there,

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.900
then say lovey.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.060
So it goes.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:33.420
The other one was that in order to run your code,

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.460
you do your Excel things.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:44.600
Your Excel had to go and upload and actually execute your data and code in Microsoft Azure somewhere in a container somehow.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.600
There may be privacy concerns,

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.680
but even just from a,

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.840
I'm on an airplane or I'm in a place that has crappy internet,

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.160
or I'm at a coffee shop and don't have good internet,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.520
but I still would like to do some work.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.140
I just,

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:01.060
any disconnected scenario whatsoever was not ideal.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:08.580
So the Anaconda folks who were providing some of the foundation for that through Anaconda,

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:13.700
the distributable Python environment for that,

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:19.340
they came out with this thing called the Anaconda code add-in for Excel,

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.340
which solves some of these problems.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.160
It's pretty cool.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.880
So what's,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.980
I guess for some people,

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.560
the main takeaway might be that you can run it locally,

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.660
which is pretty awesome.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:38.420
but I think what's more interesting is that this is based on PyScript.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.940
Remember PyScript,

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.920
the WASM version of Python on the front end?

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.500
Yeah.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.620
Yeah.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.160
And I imagine it must be based on the Pyodide,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.460
not the micro Python version,

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.640
which would make it pretty robust in terms of what it can do.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:01.340
But what's really cool about that is you can run it locally without any setup,

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:01.840
or install.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:07.620
So you don't even have to have Python locally because it just grabs a WASM thing off the internet

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.580
or ships with it,

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.820
probably ships with it.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.300
And that's pretty cool.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:12.320
And that's pretty cool.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.940
It also says it will run cells independently.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.640
So in addition to running Python cells in row major order,

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.180
which is kind of tricky,

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.740
meaning any cells with Python code will rerun anytime any Python cells change.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.740
It can also run them independently.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.360
So cells containing Python are only rerun if the cells,

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.500
cells modify.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.360
That's kind of interesting.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.820
Um,

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.060
but this is the most interesting,

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.560
a customizable environment.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:49.720
It allows you to basically pick any package from PyPI that can execute on WASM.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.240
So there's,

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:51.640
you know,

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.940
certain limitations there,

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.200
right?

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:59.280
Like if it's based on binaries that are not available or something that can't work,

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.760
but that's a much bigger thing than the four or five packages that came with Microsoft,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.400
Python for Excel,

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.420
or whatever the official name of that is.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:07.600
Right?

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.960
So this is really,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.460
really cool.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.660
On top of that,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:19.600
there's a init.py that fires up whenever you opened up the Microsoft Excel,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.260
Python variant with this one.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:22.500
And that,

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.300
that thing's static.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.260
It's just whatever it is,

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:24.640
it is.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.800
But with this one,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.780
you can edit it.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.800
So for example,

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.340
if you have functions that you often call and you want to be able just to quick,

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.080
have them and not retype them into every,

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.520
Excel sheet or whatever,

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.440
you can write little utility functions and other helper things and import libraries,

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.100
you know,

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.640
import,

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.940
you know,

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.060
whatever library as alias.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.080
And then you just have those automatically available.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.920
So it kind of sets up your spreadsheet for easy use.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.580
So you can do really advanced things.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.540
That's pretty cool.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.280
Yeah.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:56.680
Yeah.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.380
So that's really cool.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.400
You can write your own little packages too.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.320
Exactly.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.080
Like your little,

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.560
like you could create little helper functions and other types of things and not have to do

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.640
them in the little editor window of Excel.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.580
Also supports better data types for working with NumPy.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.560
And yeah,

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.500
I think that's,

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.600
that's about it.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.700
But if you were thinking this was pretty close,

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.740
but it's not quite,

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.200
you know,

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.720
this might actually push it a little bit farther,

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.800
runs locally based on PyScript,

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.960
install your own libraries long as they run on PyScript.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.620
And honestly,

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.460
this might even push PyScript to be better,

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.260
right?

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.300
Getting some people to adapt libraries where they're like,

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.160
why would I do that before?

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.360
Like,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:39.540
Oh,

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.340
now it works in Excel.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.540
Okay.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.020
I'll do that.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:46.460
Now that seems like a big enough reason to work on compatibility with Wasm.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.380
Yeah.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.960
With both of these solutions though,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.660
I'm the,

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.000
the things that I know that you probably don't have the answer,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.120
but when sharing a spreadsheet with somebody else,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.800
do you have to have like a save or share requirements file or something like that?

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.860
Sort of.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.840
So it does say this here.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.340
It does say once an environment is created,

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:12.460
this list of IPI Wasm libraries,

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.220
like a requirements file,

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.580
it will be pinned.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.100
So when users share notebooks,

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.000
the spreadsheet will retain the exact environment for all of the users.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.340
Oh,

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:21.540
okay.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.960
So I'm imagining if you've got the X,

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.880
the add-in installed and it sees the,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.880
the workbook or whatever it's called,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.600
it's probably got a list of some sort of startup code,

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.460
like based on this version of PyScript and Python.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.760
And then here's the list of dependencies.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.500
And it probably just grabs it from the internet,

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.080
like a browser would and then goes.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.940
Yeah.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:46.980
But I also don't know what happens if you share one of these with two people.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.560
Yeah.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:49.900
Yeah.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.420
Yeah.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.120
Yeah.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:51.980
Cool.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.280
Awesome.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.740
We were talking about David Lord and Flask already,

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.560
but now I want to talk about a blog post he has.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.760
So David Lord depends.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.180
He,

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:07.100
he keeps up a lot of stuff and he released a article called disabling scheduled

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.420
dependency updates.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.260
And I,

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:10.620
yes,

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.020
please.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.660
I kind of see that with,

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.160
with,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.360
with Python bites.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:14.920
Cause you,

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.700
you have a,

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.800
like what depend upon turned on and stuff.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.460
I thought I turned it off.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:19.460
I thought I turned it off,

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.420
but it won't go off.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.760
It's driving me nuts.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.920
So,

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.780
um,

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.820
the,

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.380
what,

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.920
and David's even had,

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.740
so he's looked into,

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.240
he's got,

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.040
um,

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.760
like 20 active projects that he is,

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.820
even though they're low activity projects,

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.760
there's 20 projects that he's,

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.020
um,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.000
keeping an eye on.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.080
And,

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:39.600
um,

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.300
and there's within those,

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.380
a lot of them are like libraries.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:44.940
So you're not,

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.760
you're not really,

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.880
you think you,

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.660
you don't have to update the dependencies for applications with our requirements.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.320
That text file.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.040
You totally do.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.220
You have to keep those up,

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.560
but for projects,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.000
um,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.140
for like libraries,

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.900
we usually keep those open.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.960
We don't pin dependencies,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.420
but we do pin development environment and,

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.220
uh,

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.100
CI environment and all that stuff.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.920
And that's a lot of what he's talking about.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.980
So the,

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.120
the environments,

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:15.120
or what he calls ecosystems are like the requirements file for develop development environment.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.880
He keeps those up with pip compile.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:22.460
And then you've got pre-commit hooks because you're testing a lot of stuff and those hooks might update.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.760
So you have different hook versions.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.880
And then you also have GitHub actions with,

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.140
within CI workflows.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:29.800
So there's,

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.960
there's things like checkout and,

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.880
and the other,

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.820
there's lots of,

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.580
lots of things you can do with GitHub actions.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.140
Those may have been updated.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.480
How do you keep track of those?

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.980
So he potentially has three commits,

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.420
uh,

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:43.920
time,

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.140
any bot times 20 applications,

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.280
um,

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.000
going on because of these,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.300
these,

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:49.640
uh,

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.000
dependent bots and things.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.100
And that's,

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:52.380
um,

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:52.680
and that's,

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.620
and that's,

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.600
uh,

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:54.860
it,

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.380
it could be more if you didn't pop,

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:57.900
uh,

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.640
pull this down,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.280
but he set everything up to only notify him once a month for these things.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280
But still,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.420
even only once a month,

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.860
that's like 60 emails at once a month and,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:07.740
uh,

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.880
having to deal with that.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:09.460
So,

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.040
um,

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.140
for a lot of these projects,

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.320
what he's done is he's went down to doing it locally.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.740
The idea is then,

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.780
um,

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.460
you've got,

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.180
you use talks or something.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:19.780
Yeah.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.080
He's using talks with,

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:21.320
uh,

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.920
with some labels to do some stuff.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.420
So locally he will run pip compile,

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.540
um,

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.020
to,

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:28.720
to,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.440
to,

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.160
to do a new development environment.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.400
And then,

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:32.820
um,

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.300
also GitHub actions.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.860
And there wasn't a local version available.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.800
So he wrote GHA update,

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.140
which,

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:39.460
um,

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.580
which is a new,

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:40.940
uh,

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.120
little act GitHub action updater,

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.040
uh,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.540
that you can go out and look to see if there's any,

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.100
any updates to your GitHub actions.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:49.980
So very cool.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.820
Thanks for that.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.780
Um,

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.800
and then also pre-compute,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.420
um,

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.040
doing an auto update for everything.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.580
So yes,

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.380
this is a,

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.580
like you might be a risk to like,

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.240
just update everything on a project,

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.560
but the,

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.940
when should you do this?

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.520
This is for development environment.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.920
So instead of having,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.600
and this is the idea around it also,

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.680
if you've got a project that isn't doing a lot of development,

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.600
it'll look like there's a lot of development going on with the GitHub history.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.480
And it's just these dependency updates.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.220
Instead of,

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.840
or you look at the PRs and I'll say 500,

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.420
500 closed PRs,

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.860
but there's only one real PR.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:25.420
Yeah.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.500
But then there's also like,

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.220
it's mind shift to the,

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.040
the shifting,

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.540
you're shifting how things work and remembering,

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.400
you know,

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.180
what your test situation is and everything for these projects is jumping around.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.180
So instead it's when,

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.400
like on a day when he's looking at something,

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:43.920
he'll go,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.160
Oh,

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.600
these haven't been updated for a while.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.640
I'll go,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.460
I'll go update while I'm working on it.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.340
I'll update all of these things.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.580
And then he can do that as one of the,

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.280
one of the commits on a day that he's working on it anyway.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:57.840
So the,

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.580
so the activity looks is closer to when he's actually working on something.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.000
And I,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.640
you know,

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.000
of course,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
like we're talking about,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.440
this is more important.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.360
If you're,

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.180
it's less important for development environment fixes because that users don't,

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.380
aren't affected by it for libraries.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.540
If you have runtime dependencies,

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.360
you really should be checking that more than once a month.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.460
but for,

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:20.940
for,

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.340
for development environment stuff,

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.260
I think this is cool.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.440
So I'm going to take a look at this as well.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.680
I love it.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.480
I'm going to make another effort to disable more depend about stuff.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.280
Cause it's so,

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.580
so wordy.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.520
There's a issue somewhere on GitHub.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.680
I can't remember on where are you going?

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:45.580
Complain about Nevada offer feedback and learnings.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.600
I believe there was one about,

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.880
could we please,

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:55.400
have a digest instead of a separate email and a separate PR.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:55.720
They're like,

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.260
no,

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.020
why would you want that?

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.880
Because I like,

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.380
I'm not quite as bad off as David.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.760
Cause a lot of my projects and repos,

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.240
I'm like,

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:05.540
no,

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.180
I'm not turning depend about on at all,

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.440
but it's the important ones I did.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.140
And I woke up this morning to probably 40,

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.860
40 PRs.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.380
You know what?

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.720
Just tell me I could get some updates for this thing.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.660
I'm not going to do them one at a time.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.380
I'm not going to say,

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:21.980
Oh,

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.960
you know what?

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.840
Let me reschedule this week.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:28.100
And we're going to go through one at a time and we're going to see how they work.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:28.340
Right.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:28.660
It's,

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.580
it's not,

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.880
you know,

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.760
missions or not,

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.020
not flight control software for a spaceship.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:35.820
It's like,

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.500
it's a website.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.220
If it doesn't work,

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:37.980
I'll roll it back.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.400
And I know what I'm using this stuff for.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.320
Like if,

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:41.820
if,

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.500
if some of these things update,

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.200
if I got six updates,

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.300
I'll update them all.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.660
If all the tests pass,

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.580
I'll look at it.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:50.900
Um,

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:51.580
uh,

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.800
it's fine.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.160
Uh,

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:53.460
if,

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.000
if all,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.720
if I've got good coverage and I'm really testing the heck out of something,

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.480
it should be fine.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.460
If it breaks,

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.040
then I might,

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.360
you know,

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:00.760
take,

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.400
go roll,

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.860
look at that more closely,

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.900
but it's only usually going to be one dependency that's mucking me up.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.020
It's not going to be.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.260
Yeah.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.800
Breaking for several reasons.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.120
Exceedingly rare that a change in a dependency will cause,

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.720
cause a break.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.420
Cause you're only using a little bit of the app.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:17.700
You're like,

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:24.320
the last time that I got one was Mongo engine updated and it wasn't dealing with

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.320
multi threading correctly.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.920
And even their testing didn't catch it because it only appeared when you're

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.100
doing like production web servers,

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.480
like grain,

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:37.820
you know,

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.940
micro is here or something.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.720
And then processing multi multiple requests in a Reddit scenario.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.400
So even doing like web test stuff on it,

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.140
it didn't surface those errors,

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:48.580
you know?

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.220
So it's just like,

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:49.420
well,

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.420
you know what?

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.140
We're going to roll that one back and wait till they fix it.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:53.820
Then I'll roll it back,

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.340
you know,

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:54.560
two,

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:54.960
two,

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.660
one step back,

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.020
two steps forward and we'll be fine.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.680
And the way I were,

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.980
I really usually get hit with,

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.200
with deprecations.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.240
So I'll run,

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.420
I'll run the test with,

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.540
with all warrant,

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.740
like deprecation warnings turned all,

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.480
all the way up.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:11.960
so that,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.800
so I can see those.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.220
And then you can have the decision of,

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:16.720
should I,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.200
should I deal with that deprecation right now?

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.000
Or should I,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.420
I can schedule it then,

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.780
turn that off and schedule the deprecation notice.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.900
It's not that it's broken.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.480
It's just,

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.540
it's not going to run like this forever.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.820
I might want to use the new interface or something like that.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:32.780
Yeah.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:32.980
Well,

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:33.460
David,

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.260
I feel your pain and thanks for writing the article.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:36.760
Yeah.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.240
All right.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.700
Now we're done with our main topics.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.180
Yes.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:40.420
Now,

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.140
indeed we are.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:46.660
and I don't have any extra other than the note that I have decided to

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:46.940
switch.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.820
So,

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:48.760
okay.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.160
I'll just go ahead and do this right now.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:50.520
Uh,

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.320
since I already got my screen up testing code,

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.100
I already have it.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.220
Uh,

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:58.040
testing code.com.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.900
I had it up.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:00.880
There we go.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.740
Okay.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:06.420
Episode 221 was in June and it was a two parter.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.740
It's part one of a two part,

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.920
two part episode,

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.020
two episode series.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.080
I don't know why.

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.360
I just dropped the ball and didn't do part two.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.980
So,

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.600
uh,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.140
this week I'm planning on releasing part two so that people can,

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.620
if they want to catch up,

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.700
but it's now a testing code.

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.160
Anyway,

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:21.920
that's my answer.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.800
Close that loop.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.180
Excellent.

00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.240
Nice.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:25.480
All right.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:25.560
Well,

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.560
I got a couple,

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.720
some highs and lows,

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.140
if you will,

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:28.460
Brian,

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.860
and all in between.

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.560
Okay.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:30.880
Check.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.080
This is exciting.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:32.740
Check this,

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.140
this,

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:33.660
uh,

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.580
this merged PR for Unidep.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.000
So Unidep manages dependencies across conda.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.220
uh,

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.700
and pip managed environments.

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.400
It's super cool.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.220
We talked about it in episode 366.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:45.980
Okay.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.200
We also talked about,

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:47.980
uh,

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.260
just path,

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.580
which added a badge.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.400
See that?

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.620
Python bytes,

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:53.860
three,

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.220
seven,

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:54.680
seven.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.660
Oh,

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:55.880
cool.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.320
Pretty cool.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:56.720
Right.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.880
Remember we talked about that.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.320
Yeah.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:58.600
Well,

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.300
this PR adds the badge.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.820
So if you go over to Unidep,

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:06.440
you can see it's got IPI version,

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.680
pytest passing,

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.080
code coverage number stars,

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:09.880
and Python bytes,

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.640
366.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.360
So we have a,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.580
another badge signing.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.360
I would point this out mostly to just say,

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:15.740
Hey people,

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.700
if we talk about your stuff and you want to link back to the episode,

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.060
this badge is a cool way to do it.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.200
Okay.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:21.640
And where,

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.200
where again,

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.620
do people get the code for the badge?

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.840
They can just,

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.720
uh,

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.660
well actually you can look at that PR and it'll show you if you go to files

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.220
changed,

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.100
it's just this link,

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.500
this image shields,

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:33.960
badge,

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:34.740
Python bytes,

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.460
the number,

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.280
the color,

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.300
and then put in the link to where it goes to.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:39.960
Cool.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.340
Even,

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.100
even links to the time when their topic was discussed.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.140
So that's pretty cool.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.020
Neat.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:46.480
So I would,

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.200
I would say based it on the Unidep and PR and just grab it from there or just

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:50.720
grab the code.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.120
from the read me.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.440
Cool.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.300
Cool.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.220
All right.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:55.920
Uh,

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.520
we'll do this one next.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.400
Started using a C called raindrop.io.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.420
I talked about omnivore.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.260
Have we talked about before,

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.520
but it's like reminded people like you should be using omnivore.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:05.980
It's awesome.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.340
I don't use it,

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:07.920
but yeah,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.340
you should,

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.060
you should be using it,

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.220
Brian.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:09.520
You should.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.380
But if you,

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.600
if you had something like delicious,

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.440
you remember delicious.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.080
Yeah.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:14.720
Or those things,

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.880
things where you would save links.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.020
And I don't,

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:17.940
I mean,

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.560
I don't hardly ever use my bookmarks in my browser.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.640
because they're so,

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.860
they're so poorly poor to get to and stuff.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.140
Uh,

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:30.500
the only reason I make a bookmark is maybe so auto complete for my browser.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.480
Address bar might pull something from there,

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:33.860
you know,

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.240
but I started using this thing called raindrop,

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.020
which gives you a whole bunch more options.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.260
and it's kind of like a more modern delicious.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.520
And from what I can tell,

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.100
it's got pretty strong privacy.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.100
For example,

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.520
I think when you install it as a browser plugin,

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.560
which you don't have to even,

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.380
but if you did,

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.540
it doesn't ask,

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.500
ask for access to the page content,

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.540
unless you enable certain features,

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:59.100
like it will completely download the page and save a history for you.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.340
in case the page changes or goes away,

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.320
the website goes away,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.180
your bookmark will still have the content and stuff like that.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:05.900
Anyway,

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.800
people can check that out.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.440
It's pretty cool.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.500
I'll have to check it out.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:13.420
What I really want is a bookmark manager that like automatically deletes junk.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.100
I haven't visited in like a year.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.100
Yeah,

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.460
exactly.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.380
You don't seem interested in this anymore.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.180
You know,

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:19.380
I,

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.080
I,

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.540
before I imported all my bookmarks into it,

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.280
I had to do,

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.980
I deleted like half of my bookmarks because they were,

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.800
they were bad.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.940
They were old and duplicates and weird.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.160
All right.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.700
How about a little bit of drama?

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.360
I don't want to talk too much about this,

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.940
but I think it's worth putting out there.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:39.160
You can look into it and make from what it,

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:39.660
uh,

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.040
what,

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.440
what for me will there was an incident where,

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.140
uh,

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:48.280
one of the core developers was suspended given a three month,

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.540
uh,

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.160
suspension or something like that.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.100
And I'm sure a lot of people have heard about this,

00:37:55.100 --> 00:38:01.780
but then there was a followup or Gita Van Rossum posted something referring to

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:02.280
that person,

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.380
not even by name.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.760
And their post was removed for violating the guidelines.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.180
We're mentioning that.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:08.400
And I,

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:08.880
I don't know.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.340
This is,

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.760
I feel like this should be something people are aware of,

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.140
that this kind of stuff is going on.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.160
Uh,

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.400
but I don't know enough about it to take a side or have a strong opinion,

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.280
but it seems important.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.760
Hmm.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.740
So,

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.000
well,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:25.540
okay.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.320
Uh,

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:26.720
just to,

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.580
to make sure that we were aware that the,

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.840
the post that they're talking about here did get put back.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.120
Okay.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.360
So it got put on,

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.820
the post got put on timeout.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:38.940
Interesting.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:40.240
Okay.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.920
All right.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.180
Anyway,

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.340
people can check it out.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:43.860
It's linked there.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.380
Um,

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:50.200
nearly final call for the coding in a castle in Italy.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.140
We put up a $500 last minute special.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:54.560
So,

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.340
so got,

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:55.720
uh,

00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.080
some seats left and I'd love to see you there and talk Python for six days and

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.160
enjoy Italy together.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:02.460
So,

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.160
uh,

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.160
hopefully people can make that.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.720
I'll put that in a length as well.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.640
And that's all I got,

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:06.840
Brian.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.620
Okay.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.360
Well,

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.280
I want to show you that.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.040
So the,

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:10.340
uh,

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:10.640
the,

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.060
this is the,

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.280
it was a rake choice voting thing.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:15.560
And,

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.100
and Guido said something,

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.780
um,

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.220
and he referred to the band person.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.560
And for some reason that got hidden for a while.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.200
And people were like,

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.600
why would you hide that?

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.120
But it's not hidden anymore.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:27.440
So.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.120
Yeah.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.260
I'll just read the whole post.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.080
I don't know much about voting systems,

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.180
but I know someone who does.

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:32.660
Unfortunately,

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.540
he's currently banned.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:37.040
Maybe we can wait until his three month ban expires and ask him for advice.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.520
It doesn't seem that controversial to me.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.120
No,

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.140
but anyway,

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:42.480
yeah.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.600
Anyway,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.280
you know,

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.000
it's not funny though,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:45.360
is it?

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.240
It's not very funny.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:47.900
It's not.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:48.320
Well,

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.220
we need something funny.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.240
Exactly.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:50.980
Exactly.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.340
Well,

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.300
do you know,

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.100
I know you do some C programming.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:55.800
C is pretty funny,

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.060
right?

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.080
Yeah.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.940
So this,

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.240
I believe this is a,

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.560
was a sidebar from a rust,

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.440
a rust book.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:06.840
And,

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.560
yeah,

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.040
and the title is C will watch in silence.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.540
C is a watching you.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.520
And I can't unsee this image.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.540
So on side note,

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.560
other programming languages,

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.180
hold on.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.920
You might say other programming languages don't require me to think about lifetimes.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.000
Why does rust make it so complicated?

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:31.140
the C programming language will happily let you access memory has been freed leading to undefined behavior.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.540
It'll watch in silence as you walk off the edge of a cliff.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.680
It will watch you.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.500
Do you feel,

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.820
when has C watched you?

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.100
Have you,

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.080
has it watched you?

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.000
C is watched.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.660
You do a lot of C.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.220
Yeah.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.020
Yeah,

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:45.300
I write,

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.100
I write a lot of C.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:46.640
Well,

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.820
do you feel like it watches you?

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.400
No.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.340
I don't know.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.920
That's the joke I got.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:53.460
Yeah,

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.160
it's an entire tool belt and you can shoot yourself in the foot with it if you want.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.400
But yeah,

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:58.960
no,

00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.240
I mean,

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.560
it's a fair point the book is making,

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.040
but it's,

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:01.880
yeah,

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.580
we'll watch you in silence as you walk off the edge.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:05.040
Okay.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.880
I got another funny thing that,

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.580
that sort of a comment from Marco says,

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.680
if,

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.360
if I recall correctly in 2022,

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.200
none was the most second,

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.920
most popular testing framework.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.680
Cry emoji.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.660
Well,

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.580
I expanded the list and none is still 36%.

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.540
It is still the,

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.720
the second most popular.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.100
I love that they hit it.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.120
It was like,

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.980
we're just going to put under the show more tab.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.220
Yeah.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.240
36% of the answer.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.260
None.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.300
Yikes.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.660
In fact,

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.680
it's nearly beating all other true test frameworks.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:52.740
I think it is maybe all of the true test frameworks other than pytest combined.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.140
Yeah.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.480
Well,

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.200
it's because mocking and doc tests or hypothesis and stuff.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.080
Don't.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:41:59.340
Yeah.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.420
Don't combine in that way,

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:01.740
I guess.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.100
Yeah.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:04.480
None.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.480
36%.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.780
Maybe that's the joke.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:07.900
Maybe that's the joke.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.200
The joke is the software you write without tests.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:12.360
Exactly.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:12.460
Exactly.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.160
It will watch you walk off the edge of a cliff silently.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:15.940
Yeah.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.980
So anyway,

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.520
fun day today talking with you about Python.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.620
And as always,

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:25.300
as a reminder,

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:25.760
next week,

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.180
it will be Monday for everybody.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.620
We hope,

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.020
hopefully that's normal.

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:31.960
Hopefully.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.480
Hopefully.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.800
We'll see what the holidays do to us.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.240
See you later.
