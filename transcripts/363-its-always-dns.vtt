00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
>> Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver


00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.760
Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.360
This is Episode 363,


00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.000
recorded December 5th. I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.280
>> I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.840
>> This week, we are sponsored by ourselves.


00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.080
We will plug our own stuff a little bit later.


00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.980
If you want to follow the show,


00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.480
follow it at pythonbytes@fastadon.org.


00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.280
Also, Michael and I are both on Fastadon as well,


00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.800
which is Mastodon.


00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.400
If you're anywhere other than Fastadon also, that's fine.


00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.560
You can still follow us.


00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.040
But if you would like an invite,


00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.560
hit one of us up and we will send you an invite.


00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.720
>> Mastodon has made it easier to


00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.440
start following people from other instances, by the way.


00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.720
I don't know if you remember how it used to be.


00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.440
You'd go and somebody would be like at mast.to,


00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.960
and it'd be like, "Sign in."


00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.040
You couldn't follow them, you have to sign in.


00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.320
You're like, "But I have an account here.


00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.400
What is this weirdness?"


00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.880
Now, if you say, "Follow," it'll pull a dropdown and say,


00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.160
"Give me a few letters out of your instance."


00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.960
Then we'll direct you over there


00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.320
where you're signed in to click "Follow."


00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.040
So it's a little bit easier to follow.


00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.720
Anybody on Mastodon, it's still clunky.


00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.360
I don't know why it's so hard.


00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.400
>> What I usually do is, I've not tried that.


00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400
I usually pop somebody's whole,


00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.680
say, @mkennedy@fastadon.org or something.


00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.040
I pop it in the search bar.


00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.440
>> That's what I did previously as well.


00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.720
>> Yeah.


00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.360
>> Yeah. It usually finds the person.


00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.440
>> Yeah. You can even put just the whole URL of


00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.080
their profile without reordering it to their username.


00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.760
>> But if I'm trying to find the URL,


00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.680
that's sometimes, yeah.


00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.640
>> Indeed. Well, Mastodon is getting a little smoother.


00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.720
Actually, Mastodon conversations are going to be


00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.480
featured at least in my stuff here somewhat heavily.


00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.040
So yeah, let's talk about Fixit.


00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.160
So Fixit is this,


00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.760
what's the best way to put it? It's probably a Flake 8-like.


00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.200
They compare it to Flake 8.


00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.720
This comes from Meta, aka Facebook,


00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.760
and it's a linter for their monorepo.


00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.080
When you hear monorepo,


00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.120
that is not a monolith.


00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.720
Ironically, a lot of times,


00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.120
the more broken up your code is,


00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.440
the more it fits a monorepo.


00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.320
But anyway, they have literally a single repo.


00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.040
Is it Git? I'm not sure, but something like


00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.440
a single Git repo for all of Facebook,


00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.000
which is just insane.


00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.480
They want to lint that,


00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.080
and they want to have things like Black applied to it.


00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.200
Black actually came from Lukas Lange,


00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.720
who was at Meta at the time, so funny.


00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.280
But they don't use Black.


00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.880
I don't know why they don't use Black.


00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.000
They have some reasons.


00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.440
Seems like Black saw some of them and could be


00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.880
probably adapted while Lukas was there.


00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.840
But anyway, they don't.


00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.520
So they had this thing called Fixit that goes through,


00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.000
and is more like Black even though they compare it to Flake 8,


00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.560
and that it not just finds problems,


00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.800
but fixes them and normalizes things like,


00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.040
where do your commas go in a list?


00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.920
Or you have a plus to continue a line.


00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.320
Is that at the end of the one line


00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.600
or the beginning of the other line?


00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.320
Those kinds of things we're all familiar with.


00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.320
So they built one called Fixit,


00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.720
and now they released another one called Fixit 2,


00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.280
that's supposed to be better,


00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.000
and they open-sourced it so people


00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.160
can check this out if they're interested.


00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.120
So I'll tell you a quick few things about it.


00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.200
Let's bump over to the Mastodon,


00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.600
not the Mastodon, Omnivore, other thing.


00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.280
Because I have notes on this big long thing.


00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.760
So it turns out that Python is super popular over at Meta,


00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.200
which is really cool.


00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.480
They have production engineers and software engineers.


00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.240
So production engineers are like software devs who do production,


00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.760
their main role is to do production.


00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.080
They also have a whole Python language foundation team,


00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.520
which is pretty interesting.


00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.120
The job of this team is basically to build tools for the rest of the team,


00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.880
and that's where this Fixit thing comes.


00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.560
So one question is, why not just use,


00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.680
say, Black or Flake 8 or whatever?


00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.360
>> Or a format.


00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.440
>> Well, now we're getting there.


00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.280
So it says, of course,


00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.840
there's alternatives to Flake 8,


00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.600
but for example, Flake 8 doesn't fix things.


00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.920
It just tells you that there are errors.


00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.080
It has limited support.


00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.440
This is interesting for hierarchical configurations


00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.640
for different projects within a monorepo.


00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.280
So even though it's a monorepo,


00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.080
maybe the API gets formatted this way,


00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.480
but the, I don't know,


00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.200
the DevOps code gets a different set of configurations because it's a different team,


00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.400
but you still want to just hit the repo with it.


00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.480
>> Interesting.


00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.960
>> Yeah. That's an interesting.


00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.480
This is worth bringing up, I thought,


00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.360
because there are some interesting ideas and some interesting challenges.


00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.080
Slow performance on large code bases.


00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.960
Then another thing that they do a lot is they plug in custom rules,


00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.840
blending rules and correction rules at a hierarchical level,


00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.920
which is interesting.


00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.960
Now, Brian, I don't know if everyone sees it,


00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.320
but I have a list of these four things,


00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.240
these four reasons of why not just X.


00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.720
Three of them are green because rough absolutely hits all,


00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.120
rough space format hits all of those.


00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.400
Rough format didn't exist,


00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.960
and I honestly wonder if rough format existed.


00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.280
Is this a thing that gets created?


00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.360
I'm not sure. I mean, it's an open question.


00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.600
>> I didn't know that rough could do hierarchical configuration.


00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.320
>> Actually, well, what rough can do is you can have


00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.280
a rough.toml that configures it at different levels.


00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.160
Given the number of engineers and the fact there's a single repo,


00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.080
how hard would it be to automate,


00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.840
search this repo for all the rough.tomls,


00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.480
run rough format.in that working directory?


00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.840
>> Yeah.


00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.600
>> Done. I don't think it inherently does,


00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.080
but in 30 minutes it does.


00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.480
>> Yeah.


00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.120
>> One person's time.


00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.440
I wouldn't suspect as a company,


00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.960
we couldn't possibly have somebody write that automation.


00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.800
That's way too much for us.


00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.920
I think that obviously,


00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.680
I don't believe that's a dash-dash hierarchical option,


00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.720
but I think that could easily be added.


00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.720
That's pretty cool. Here's the irony,


00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.640
is even with the one we built,


00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.640
it didn't contain the local linting rules or the hierarchical configuration.


00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.240
Those are the core requirements.


00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.360
It's like, okay, well, we redesigned it to this new one.


00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.080
What's interesting is it works using the libcst module,


00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.360
which is a concrete syntax tree.


00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.880
You often hear of AST or abstract syntax tree,


00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.840
which is like the intent of the code is to loop over this iterable,


00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.360
but it is not. The variable is named this,


00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.160
and there's two spaces here, and there's a comma.


00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.560
It tries to throw away,


00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.760
just get to the essence, but the CST is the code just in hierarchy form,


00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.560
and which means if you want to fix it,


00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.320
that's way more applicable for these kinds of tools here.


00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.720
Anyway, people can check it out.


00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.240
It's on PyPI, and I think it's an interesting thing to contrast with Ruff.


00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.160
Anyway, it's out there for people.


00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.840
It's obviously tested on some pretty seriously large code bases,


00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.040
and it could be interesting,


00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.920
but I'm still going to Ruff space format dot for my money.


00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.040
>> Yeah. Interesting comment from Grant in the chat.


00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.360
Another YAML file for each sub-project


00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.440
as opposed to supporting PyProject.YAML.


00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.160
>> Totally fair. In this case,


00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.680
I think it might be, you got to remember,


00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.960
this isn't just Python.


00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.440
This is like every bit of code at Facebook.


00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.160
>> Oh, yeah.


00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.840
>> Right. It's probably React, PHP,


00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.440
optimized PHP, who knows how much stuff is in there.


00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.360
>> Gobs of config files in each project.


00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.680
>> Yes. You wouldn't want all the configs for all the languages all mixed together.


00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.280
Anyway, but still interesting stuff.


00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.040
>> Anyway. How would you like to talk about user interfaces?


00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.280
>> We have been known to go on a gooey kick before.


00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.120
It's been a while. Let's do it. I'm here for it.


00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.360
>> All right. Samuel Colvin.


00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.800
>> As long as you make it fast, Brian.


00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.760
>> That was funny. The person that brought us PyDantic


00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.480
has worked very closely with FastAPI as well.


00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.840
FastAPI and PyDantic work great together.


00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.520
Now there's FastUI.


00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.560
Well, FastUI is working with FastAPI,


00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.560
but it also works with other stuff too.


00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.680
Samuel Colvin has just recently brought us FastUI,


00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.920
which looks like an active development.


00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.080
It's been modified five hours ago.


00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:34.280
I only heard about it last week and it's now at 1.8 thousand stars.


00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.360
>> That's pretty awesome.


00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.560
>> Anyway. What's this?


00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.600
It is supposedly still a work in progress,


00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.880
so not production ready,


00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.360
but it's a way to build web applications and


00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.800
web UIs defined by declarative Python code.


00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.600
There's a few points around this.


00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.840
There's a bunch of parts of it.


00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.080
It's a PyPI package, FastUI.


00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.960
It brings in some models and some UI elements and components.


00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.840
It's also an npm package,


00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.440
so it brings in a little React TypeScript stuff.


00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.600
What does it really mean though?


00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.880
It means that you can look at,


00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.400
there's a couple of examples he shows.


00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.080
You declare it like this.


00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.200
You're declaring a FastAPI endpoint


00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.880
like user table or something like that, let's say endpoint.


00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.240
It's going to return this thing that doesn't look like HTML,


00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.480
and it doesn't quite look like Python either, but it is.


00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.320
There's a CPage object which wraps the page.


00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.920
There's components inside,


00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.880
which is a list of things like headings and a table.


00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.720
I don't really know what this looks like, but it's not bad.


00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.800
I'm excited to play with it.


00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.480
But in a few lines of code,


00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.320
he shows a fairly workable,


00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.200
clean-looking user interface.


00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.960
Then along with it, for the release,


00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.280
he released a full demo which you can walk through


00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.680
a UI demo that is really zippy and works pretty good.


00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.080
The tables one is fun because it shows


00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.920
a whole bunch of names of cities and populations,


00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.040
and you can quickly filter by country and it's super fast.


00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:30.480
I think you get a lot for not much work if the workflow looks okay.


00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.440
So you've done more UIs than I have. What do you think of this?


00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.640
>> It's interesting.


00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.640
>> Okay.


00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.920
>> So when I think of building web apps for myself,


00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.720
I don't shy away from saying,


00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.200
"Oh, I have to write HTML or there has to be a template model,"


00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.480
or something like that. That's okay for me.


00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:47.880
>> Yeah.


00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.720
>> But I've been doing it for 15 years at least, I would say.


00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.880
I probably started doing web stuff in 2000,


00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.480
so that's a little bit more than that.


00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.880
Anyway, that's a long time,


00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.120
so I'm super comfortable with it.


00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.840
But I know there's a lot of use cases


00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.640
where I just want something quick and easy,


00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.440
I want a simple deployment,


00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.240
or I'm not a web developer and I just want to get this up and going.


00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.920
I like it. A lot of the low-code,


00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.600
zero HTML styles that I've seen like,


00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.000
"Oh, here you can do it in Python,"


00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.680
have a top-to-bottom linear way of creating the code,


00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.600
and I super dislike that.


00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.280
First, I'm going to create a page object,


00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.480
then I'm going to say page.components.add,


00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.920
then I'm going to go page.components.add,


00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.200
and then I'll get a table and I'll say table.rows.add.


00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.920
It makes it really hard to see the visual look.


00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.040
So if you go check out the fast UI at GitHub ReadMe,


00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.040
you'll see that the structure and the indentation of the code


00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.800
matches the DOM, and that's quite nice.


00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.280
>> Yeah.


00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.120
>> So I really like that aspect of it.


00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.200
It reminds me a lot of Flutter,


00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.160
where you write code in the exact same way you've got,


00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.280
I don't know if you call it a DOM,


00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.600
but whatever the widget graph is called in Flutter,


00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.840
you do the same type of thing.


00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.960
Like you'd have a body,


00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.280
and then the body has a child,


00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.520
and then the child can be some complex thing,


00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.760
and it's all nested in a very similar way.


00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.800
So I think it's super interesting.


00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.440
I think it will empower a lot of people.


00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.920
>> I like the structure of the code


00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.400
matches the thing you're building.


00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.120
That makes it way more appealing to me


00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.880
because that's part of what's nice about HTML.


00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.600
You go in there and you're in the table and


00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.840
you're indented in the table visually.


00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.480
You know what I mean?


00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.960
>> Yeah. There's a lot of fun stuff here too.


00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.040
So even like forms and stuff that you can


00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.960
do with even server-side validation.


00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.320
So that it's not just a component library,


00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.000
but also some React and


00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
some other things going with it is pretty cool.


00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.480
Kim brings up something that I thought of directly for myself.


00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.680
He says, "It's got a lot of appeal for


00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.200
enterprise-grade web apps where


00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.600
boring simple table layout is more than enough."


00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.920
I was thinking of it like that data set thing.


00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.800
Basically, I've got a database that I want to front end for,


00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.120
but it's not necessarily SQL or something,


00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.440
or data set just freaks me out maybe.


00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.400
But something like this is I think pretty nice.


00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.000
I think a lot of enterprise projects will be using this to play with.


00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.200
So I'm actually thinking about it for my own internal project myself.


00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.000
>> Sure. It looks quite neat and being based on FastAPI.


00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.920
Boy, would it be cool if there was a run


00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.120
it locally as an electron app like thing.


00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.680
>> Yeah.


00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.720
>> Where the electron app shipped with Python and just ran a hidden.


00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.240
>> Build a user interface.


00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.040
>> So it becomes a make it a thing,


00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.720
an exe or a.app I can share with my users.


00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.640
>> Yeah.


00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.640
>> But yeah, I agree with Kim that forms over data, this nails it.


00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.440
>> Like you said, a lot of web developers,


00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.680
it doesn't take that much web training to write some HTML.


00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.220
To do it well,


00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:09.800
it takes a little bit but to do it good enough for a lot of projects,


00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.120
it's not bad and a normal HTML,


00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.560
CSS and the normal tool chain is still pretty good or build a Django app or something.


00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.440
But there's a lot of people that don't even want to get into it at all.


00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.640
So I think this is a good fit for that.


00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.280
>> Indeed. Chris may ask about,


00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.560
hey, I wonder what the escape hatch story is.


00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.020
It's always a good question when you're in a framework that defines so much for you.


00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.600
Like, well, what if I went a little bit more?


00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.560
Then what? So yeah.


00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.620
>> Yeah.


00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.900
>> Brian, is it a good time to remind people that


00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.580
maybe they should check out a course or two?


00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.460
>> Yeah, sure.


00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.660
So I'll remind people that this episode is brought to you by both of us,


00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:58.580
Michael and Brian, and the thing that I've been working on a lot lately is courses.


00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:05.160
Courses.pythontest.com and that is the complete pytest course.


00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.860
It's almost done, will be done this month.


00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:12.740
I've got 13 out of 16 chapters done so far and it will grow then.


00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.540
After I've gone through the entire Python testing with pytest book,


00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.780
there's extras there.


00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.020
As I've noted before,


00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:24.700
there's a lot of stuff at the end that has changed a lot like talks and CI and things,


00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.780
since the book came out.


00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.740
So I'm pretty excited. So how about you?


00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.140
>> Yeah, very awesome. I just want to highlight maybe some of our new courses.


00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.020
We have an early access Visual Studio Code for Python Developers course,


00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.380
which is partway done but available in early access mode.


00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.140
If you want to check that out. We have a Data Science Jumpstart with 10 projects from


00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:50.720
Matt Harrison and HTML plus Django course by Christopher Trudeau.


00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.140
So all of those are excellent and we've got plenty more coming as well.


00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.300
So people just check those out.


00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:56.780
>> Sweet.


00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.460
>> All right, let's go to Mastodon.


00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.660
So this one's not exactly Python,


00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.500
but there are Python elements to it.


00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.420
Basically, I said,


00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.740
we talked about this after the show and I thought,


00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.260
why don't I just have this conversation for people out there, I'll throw out a list.


00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.580
It's like, I've got a bunch of e-mails,


00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.420
want to be able to reach out to people.


00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.660
I want to run a newsletter or I want to run a training company in a podcast,


00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.380
and I want to gather those up.


00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.900
For many years, I've been using MailChimp and they


00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.580
just increasingly rub me the wrong way, just on principle.


00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.900
I'm not super keen about it.


00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.220
Three months ago, they're like, "Oh,


00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.260
we got to raise our prices because the database storage for


00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.660
your 20K or whatever it turns out to be is really rough.


00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.820
So it's another $100."


00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.140
Then the next month, like, "Oh, we're going to need to raise our prices.


00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.500
It's another $100 on top of the previous another $100."


00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.100
I'm just like, "I'm not really using a lot of this."


00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.900
I want to look for something else.


00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.020
So I went to Mastodon, I said, "Hey folks,


00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.260
MailChimp alternatives," and boy, oh boy,


00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.780
we get a ton of conversation about this.


00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.500
So I've gathered this all up and put the results of that


00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.140
into a list that I posted on the show notes.


00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.380
So I just want to run through this really quick because there's


00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.740
some interesting choices for people that have small or large mailing lists.


00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.660
They come from all these different places and interesting choices.


00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.860
So for example, one of them is called Email Octopus,


00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:23.820
because it can send like eight times as much emails like a regular,


00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.820
maybe four, like a two-handed creature.


00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.900
With all of its eight arms, it can really send email.


00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.060
Now, so this one is email marketing, which is interesting.


00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.220
There's ListMonk, which is an open-source,


00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.780
free, self-hosted newsletter and mailing list manager.


00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.420
Interesting, right? With 12,000 GitHub stars.


00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.620
There's Kilia, which is similar,


00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.100
is also open-source,


00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.100
gemmocked in Deutschland, made in Germany.


00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.180
Very, very cool and looks kind of visually nice, right?


00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.980
There's Mailie Herald, which is a Ruby on Rails one,


00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.460
also self-hosted, which is kind of fun.


00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.340
There's SendPortal again.


00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.660
So I didn't know about so many of these open-source ones,


00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.620
and that's kind of why I thought it might be interesting to point this out


00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.180
to people on the show, right?


00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.260
Like there's actually a bunch of open-source ones.


00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.820
Quite sadly, I haven't found a decent Python one.


00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.020
So there's that.


00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.660
There's Brevo, which is another one.


00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.420
ButtonDown, this one is not open-source,


00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.460
but it is made with Python open-source.


00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.700
So I talked to the guy who runs ButtonDown,


00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.540
and this one is written in Django.


00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.020
So if you want your newsletters powered by Django,


00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.340
I don't think it's open-source,


00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.180
but anyway, pretty neat option there.


00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.780
There's Zoho, which is pretty cool.


00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.660
Sendy, here's another cool one.


00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.260
Sendy is also self-hosted,


00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.340
but it's not open-source,


00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.420
but you buy it once for like $70,


00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.700
and then you run it on your system.


00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.460
And what's cool is it hooks into AWS SES,


00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.220
which is our simple email service,


00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.380
which if you send a bunch of emails, you probably have.


00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.980
I don't. I do, but I don't use it.


00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.900
I have SendGrid, which it also works with,


00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.500
and Mailjet and Elastic Email.


00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.500
And the thing that's cool about these is you can send like


00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.300
10,000 emails for a dollar, right?


00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.780
And it's based on consumption, right?


00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.260
Like even if I don't send a mail in MailChimp,


00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
it's many hundreds of dollars to just say,


00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.180
"Well, we're going to keep your database records fresh for you.


00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.180
We'll sit here."


00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.260
But this one, it's like, you know,


00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.460
they say a hundred times cheaper.


00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.260
I mean, obviously it matters how you use it,


00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.940
but you plug it into one of these super, super simple things,


00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.100
and they'll even set it up for you.


00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.820
You can pay them like another 70 bucks


00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.980
and they'll set up a server,


00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.540
an Ubuntu server or Linux server, I'll set up for you.


00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.700
So this is what I'm actually thinking


00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.940
of going with potentially.


00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.420
And there's ConvertKit, Mautic, I don't know,


00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.340
open-source marketing instead of just email,


00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.580
Constant Contact.


00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.140
I don't have any relations with any of these,


00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.780
by the way, folks, GetResponse.


00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.220
ConvertKit, all of those.


00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.180
So if you want to see the Mastodon conversation


00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.900
about why people suggested them,


00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.220
some people are like, "Oh, I worked with that,


00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.140
but it sucked, don't use that," and so on,


00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.980
you can check it out.


00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.780
So I thought there's probably enough people out there


00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.980
who are going like, "I have this problem,


00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.620
and I just see so many choices, and what are they?"


00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.580
Maybe there's open-source,


00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.860
maybe there's some Python thing.


00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.700
So there it is.


00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.660
- So we don't have a solution, but you've got something.


00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.820
Well, I'll-


00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.380
- I can report back to people how things go.


00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.060
So it's a fork in the road for me, right?


00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.740
On one hand, I don't really do,


00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.220
I don't do any tracking of people,


00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.500
and so I don't know, like, retargeting


00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.300
and all these kind of like campaigns


00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.940
where like, if you come and visit this page,


00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.780
but then two days you visit that page,


00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.020
then we're gonna send, you know, like that kind of stuff.


00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.420
I don't really do that.


00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.140
So I just basically send emails to people.


00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.660
In that case, right,


00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.740
you should be looking at something simpler.


00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.580
Maybe one of those open-source ones is pretty nice.


00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.980
But if you want to do really interesting automations,


00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.540
which maybe I should look into, I don't know,


00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.460
then maybe one of the real simple ones


00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.300
is not the right choice.


00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.500
So I should either go way more simpler or more advanced,


00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.860
but I'm in this like middle ground


00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.140
paying tons of money for something


00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.140
that I don't really appreciate.


00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.260
And I've also, finally wrapping this, put a bow on this,


00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.660
people have said, "Well, you know,


00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.100
"you can just use mail merge with Google Sheets


00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.260
"and like send it out to your Gmail."


00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:04.260
Like, no, that's awesome if you run like a soccer team


00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.940
and you want to send them a message or something like that.


00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.820
But if you have to be subjected to the US Can Spam Act,


00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.260
the GDPR, people delete my stuff,


00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.900
delete my info you have on me,


00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.860
I want to unsubscribe or want to partially unsubscribe


00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.340
or I might mail bounced and they're gonna stop sending,


00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.380
like all of that, you can't just like automate send.


00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.900
Even out of send grade is not enough, right?


00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:27.940
You need to have a whole backend


00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.100
that like deals with all that crap.


00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.540
And that's what a lot of these like open-source ones bring.


00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.140
So anyway, pretty cool.


00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:38.100
- Newsletter is, having a newsletter is more complicated


00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.820
than people think because it just is.


00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.420
- It's way more complicated.


00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.460
- And the weird thing that like the first time


00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.140
I tried to set one up was that you have to put


00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.820
your address down and so it's kind of a weird work.


00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.140
It makes sense, but also it's weird.


00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.020
- But it kind of doesn't make sense.


00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.460
- It kind of doesn't make sense.


00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.300
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.580
Like, do I really just have to put my house there?


00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.460
What can I put there?


00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.620
But because the US Can Spam Act,


00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.420
I think is the reason that that is there.


00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.300
And that's the government, right?


00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.460
Like maybe we should have cookie banners


00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.980
that everyone clicks like five times an hour a day


00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.100
for the rest of their life.


00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.620
That's gonna make things better.


00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.620
- Well, I used to like, I know we've done this enough,


00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.860
but sorry about that.


00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.940
I used to do MailChimp,


00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.380
but I had a PO box set up just for that.


00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.300
And I was like, I don't use it for anything.


00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.340
So instead of paying the post office,


00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.700
I switched to paying ConvertKit


00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.140
because one of the things ConvertKit does


00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.220
is you can use their address, which is interesting.


00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.460
But I'm still on the fence on ConvertKit.


00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.300
I'm trying it out.


00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.340
So we'll see.


00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.900
- Yeah, we can both report back to people and see,


00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.260
but it's tricky stuff.


00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.100
So anyway, hopefully that helps the folks.


00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.900
- Now, completely change of gears,


00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.380
back to command line interfaces.


00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.300
I talked about user interfaces on GUIs,


00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.940
but let's talk CLIs a little bit.


00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.900
So back on episode, what was it?


00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.300
361, we talked about appeal,


00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.900
and I've talked about arc parse and click and typer


00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.220
and stuff like that before.


00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.060
Appeal was another one.


00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.500
And this all came out because I did an episode


00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.020
on Python test about arc parse applications and testing.


00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.020
So somebody, actually, Sander76 on Fostadon,


00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.140
contacted me and said,


00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.180
"Hey, there's a bunch of other options


00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.420
"other than the ones you've covered so far.


00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.460
"Have you looked at these and how do you test them?"


00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.100
I don't have an answer about how to test them,


00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.860
but I was interested in this whole kind of line of things.


00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.060
So there's a set of command line interface tools


00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.580
that instead of arc parse style


00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.300
or something of telling, defining flags,


00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.740
they define it based on a configurable object.


00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.220
So his clipstick, for instance,


00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.860
let's start with Tyro,


00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.340
'cause this is one of the early ones


00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.900
that's kind of easy to figure out.


00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.500
Tyro is a command line interface tool


00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.900
that you can use data classes or Pydantic or adders


00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.700
to define all the options.


00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.700
So for instance, here's an example showing the video.


00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.020
You can take a, you import Tyro,


00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.340
and then you define a data class with types


00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.820
on a bunch of arcs.


00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.620
It doesn't matter what it is, what's called,


00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.620
but you have a class with a bunch of elements in it.


00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.620
And those are the things


00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.420
that you can pass to your application now.


00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.980
And then you just, you implement a Tyro CLI application.


00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.900
That's the arguments.


00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.460
And that's, it's kind of cool on parsing arcs that way.


00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.420
So that's Tyro.


00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.860
And then there's clipstick, which is kind of cute.


00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.940
Like CLI, like clipstick.


00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:00.580
Yeah, anyway, that defines all of your types


00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.420
within a base model, like from Pydantic,


00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.700
a Pydantic base model.


00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.500
And then you can define a whole bunch of types in there.


00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.500
And then you can, and it has help and all that stuff.


00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.980
So basing it on a Pydantic object.


00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.380
And then also there's a nicely designed website


00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.980
called the, with Pydantic ArgParse.


00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.060
So ArgParse with Pydantic.


00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.660
So there's another one that's defining arguments


00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.740
based on a base model.


00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.100
And I just, I haven't played with these yet.


00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.340
I just wanted to report back


00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.180
that these are some different ways


00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:41.180
to set up user interfaces using like Pydantic


00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.260
or data classes or adders or something like that


00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.380
as an object.


00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.820
And then you have, instead of,


00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.820
you get like this args object.


00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.220
Instead of having a whole bunch of different elements,


00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.940
you have like this object with all of your arguments


00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.020
that you can pass around.


00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.580
And since it's things like Pydantic, you can do things.


00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.660
I haven't played with it,


00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.940
but I'm guessing that you can do things like


00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.780
limit the scope.


00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.500
So it's not just an integer,


00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.500
but it's an integer between one and five


00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.900
or something like that.


00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.060
- Right, yeah, that's cool.


00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.620
- Yeah, so these are fun.


00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.740
- Those are super fun.


00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.420
Yeah, Pydantic is great.


00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.100
Typing for this kind of stuff is great


00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.740
because it's usually not open-ended, right?


00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.060
- That should be a number.


00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.380
And if it's not, it's gonna be a problem


00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.860
or that should be a string for the host name


00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.700
that's required.


00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.020
All these things like really map over


00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.740
to that validation side of Pydantic.


00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.260
- But I do want to, so from Sandra 76's question,


00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:35.700
how do you test these or is testing easier?


00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.860
It is a good question.


00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.820
And I've put it on my to-do list for January


00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.780
or sometime in 2024 to take a look at.


00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.260
So I'll have to report back about that also.


00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.940
- Yeah, very nice, very nice.


00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.420
So it's the Samuel Colvin and team day for you


00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.060
with fast UI and the Pydantic-based stuff.


00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.820
Yeah, indeed, good stuff.


00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.380
All right, extras, you want me to do mine first?


00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.820
- Yeah, let's hit yours first.


00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.020
- All right, well, I have one and it's super quick.


00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.140
So I just, there was this announcement here


00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.740
that Google is, Google Chrome in particular


00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.580
is looking to limit ad blockers


00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.340
and start limiting how much control people have


00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.180
over their privacy and data and stuff


00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.420
with what's called the Manifest V3 API


00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.740
for basically for using extensions.


00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.980
And the main rule here is that they're limiting


00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.340
how many domains and rules you can apply to block,


00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.980
basically to limit network traffic.


00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.580
So you can say, well, there's 500 ads you can block,


00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.100
but those are the only 500, right?


00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.220
Which really limits it.


00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.100
So people were whining, I'm like, you know what?


00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.060
Why don't I just write an article?


00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.700
Because like I could turn all that stuff off


00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.340
and I don't care at my house.


00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.500
And you could too, just instead of worrying


00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.060
about what these browsers are doing,


00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.740
just go and turn on a network level ad blocker.


00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.620
Like you can use Next DNS, which I've talked about before,


00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.500
or you can, if you want to run your own server


00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.740
and only have it when you're home,


00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.940
you can use PyHole, which I know that's super awesome,


00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.980
but Next DNS is a service, which so when you're


00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.100
at the coffee shop or traveling or on your phone,


00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.220
you can also have the benefit of PyHole.


00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.420
But anyway, I talked a lot about how that works


00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.140
and how you set it up with some cool graphs,


00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.980
like 10,000 block queries on my network


00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.700
for just two people for a little bit.


00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.180
And also this is all great.


00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.300
Once you set this up though, when you get to a place


00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.460
that says, hey, you have to disable your ad blocker


00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.620
or you can't watch this movie, read this article.


00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.460
You're like, you know what?


00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.660
I hate you, but just for a minute, I have to do this


00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.140
'cause I really, really need to get here.


00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.500
It talks about how you can set up a second browser.


00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.820
Like for me, it's Firefox, not Vivaldi,


00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.860
like Vivaldi's my main one, but Firefox,


00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.580
I set it up to use a DNS over HTTPS,


00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.500
but one that doesn't block like Cloudflare or something


00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.460
that doesn't filter anything.


00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.340
So if I have to escape my blocking network


00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.300
for whatever reason, I can just run Firefox


00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.740
and it tunnels out of all this restrictions,


00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.420
which is usually nice, but when you need to turn it off,


00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.260
you gotta turn it off.


00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.180
So there's quick article, essay, whatever you wanna call it


00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.260
for people to check out.


00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.100
- Yeah, things like that still bug me though.


00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.340
Like the turn off ad blockers, it can't be that high


00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.300
of a percentage of the population that's turning them off.


00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.340
So it's weird. - Yeah, I know.


00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:14.140
Yeah, there was one show, it was like Peacock or Paramount.


00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.220
One of those streaming platforms would not let my wife


00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.060
watch some show because it says she had her ad blocker on.


00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.380
Of course she didn't, she was on the wifi,


00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.220
which was blocking everything.


00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.380
And also the side, the extra benefit here is this means


00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.420
your mobile apps have ad blockers built in.


00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.420
This means your TV has an ad blocker built in.


00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.580
This means like everything has an ad blocker built in,


00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.740
not just your browser, right?


00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.900
So all this whinging over like whether or not


00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.660
you can do blocking in a browser,


00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.460
like you could just do better


00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.220
and it's not even your problem anymore, right?


00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.580
- Yeah, we'll have to check this out.


00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.180
- So yeah, it was super, she's like,


00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.660
"Well, Michael, how do I watch this?"


00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.780
I'm like, "I don't know actually, I'm sorry,


00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.180
"but I don't wanna turn it off for the whole everything.


00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.660
"Like I just wanna let you watch your movies.


00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.500
"How do you do that?"


00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.820
So that's in there as well.


00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.180
- Okay, cool, nice.


00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.860
Okay, I've got a few extras, won't take long though.


00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.340
Django 5 released yesterday.


00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.300
We've already talked about all the cool features


00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.540
of Django 5, didn't we?


00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.180
I think you covered it a couple of weeks ago.


00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:15.180
But I just noticed that it's not a beta or anything anymore.


00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.460
It's released, so as of December 4th.


00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.460
- It's all grown up.


00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.980
- Yeah, so. - That's awesome.


00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.060
- I'm excited to play with that, so that's fun.


00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.420
And then something submitted by Paul Barry,


00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.660
so thank you, he says, "Brian seems to like Vim


00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.380
"and you can use Vim key bindings in a lot of places."


00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.460
And so he sent over the Vim key bindings everywhere,


00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.620
the ultimate list.


00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.220
And it is a GitHub repo with a whole bunch


00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.220
of awesome things like debuggers and like Vim PDB.


00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.980
I didn't know you could do that.


00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.700
That'll be fun.


00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.580
IPython, you can turn the Vim key bindings on with IPython.


00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:00.020
Anyway, quite a few fun settings


00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.900
and telling you how to do it for different things.


00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.820
- Even email clients, look at that.


00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.900
- Yeah, none of them I use,


00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.940
but I used to use Mutt a long time ago.


00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:13.140
- Yeah, I don't see mine either, but that's--


00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.020
- Thunderbird, I should try that.


00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.100
- Yeah. - So, okay.


00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.660
So, and then I've got, for my last extra,


00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.860
I have a little drama.


00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.820
So I talked about last week that I think that Python,


00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.060
or we have before, that Test Encode is now Python Test,


00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.340
my other podcast, but I left it on the domain


00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.940
Test Encode for a while.


00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.940
But recently I tried switching it to podcast.


00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.140
So what we're looking at now is podcast.pythontest.com.


00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.540
So the new URL is that.


00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.220
But if you just go to pythontest.com,


00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.940
there's a link to the podcast.


00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.820
So you can find it that way.


00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.780
There's podcast.pythontest.com.


00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.900
Anyway, what do I do with the old domain?


00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.980
I redirected it, but it didn't work.


00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.500
I don't know what I did wrong.


00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.700
I contacted Namecheap and they said, "Looks fine to us."


00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.460
So not sure what went wrong.


00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:08.420
So I changed it, changed the DNS settings last night


00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.740
to just point to like a small site.


00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.740
So a small site that looks like this, this morning,


00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.980
it just says, "Hey, I'm here at Test Encode.


00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.540
The podcast moved, it's over there."


00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.460
And so just so that it won't 404 on people.


00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.700
And I also have some redirects.


00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.260
So if you say like testencode.com/23,


00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.460
it'll redirect to the 23rd episode over on the other one.


00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.020
Awesome, except it didn't work last night.


00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.460
I was pulling my hair out.


00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:39.300
And then I woke up this morning and it worked on my phone,


00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.860
but not here yet.


00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.860
So I know that there's this thing of saying,


00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.220
if you ever muck with DNS,


00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.640
it can take up to 72 hours to like ripple


00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.620
through the internet.


00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.740
I haven't ever had to deal with that before.


00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.900
It's always been pretty quick


00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.060
whenever I muck with DNS settings.


00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.300
Apparently I'm hitting that.


00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.240
So hopefully in a few days, it'll be all resolved.


00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.000
And so now I have to reset my days


00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.900
since it last DNS problem to zero.


00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.760
- Days since last, oh my God, that is so amazing.


00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.960
I love it.


00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.720
- So I'm showing an Etsy.


00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.580
I think you can find them lots of places,


00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.280
but there's an Etsy sticker that says zero days


00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.920
since it was DNS.


00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.000
And in parentheses, it's always DNS.


00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.760
- It is. - Anyway.


00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:27.160
- Oh my gosh, Brian, are you foreshadowing here?


00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.000
- Maybe.


00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.920
You know what I did this whole weekend?


00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.800
I have two things to cover from my extras.


00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.940
- Okay.


00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.080
- Well, I covered the one and I also just realized


00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.440
I wanted to give a quick mention just in case.


00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.800
I spent my, I don't have a thing to show,


00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.840
so just leave this up 'cause it's perfect.


00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.340
I spent all of the weekend and a good chunk of Monday


00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.280
migrating domains from different places.


00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.880
Have a bunch of old ones at GoDaddy


00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.320
because 15 years ago, that seemed all right.


00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.160
- Yeah.


00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.440
- And they're super hard to get out of there.


00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.280
So I've got a bunch at Google Domains


00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.720
'cause I thought Google Domains is beautiful


00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.580
until Google decided to shut that down


00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.720
because apparently it's too much work


00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.560
to store a DNS file that's 500 characters.


00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.400
I don't know.


00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.440
- 'Cause it's a commodity now


00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.240
and they can't make money off of it.


00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.440
- I know, I know.


00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.440
Anyway, I can understand it, but anyway.


00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.380
So I had, well, I don't want to step on that thing


00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.920
that's shutting down.


00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.000
I got to move that off


00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.720
and I got some others in other places.


00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.480
So moving that all together,


00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.080
holy moly, does that take some time.


00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.680
And sometimes they move quickly.


00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.080
Sometimes they don't.


00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.360
Some of the domains have security turned on


00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.160
that if they transfer, it takes three days for it to disable


00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.760
but the domain will transfer right away.


00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.800
But if you transfer it to, you reset it too quickly,


00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.580
it'll like just permanently stop working.


00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.160
Some of them have to have SSL


00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.440
as part of the DNS definition.


00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.120
Like .dev requires only SSL.


00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.120
But if you want to use Let's Encrypt,


00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.480
well, it's got to resolve to someplace


00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.680
but it can't resolve to someplace.


00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.520
It still has SSL.


00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.000
You're like, okay, who decided to invent a catch-22


00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.440
for domain names?


00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.560
Like, oh, ah.


00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.400
So the last, one of the last ones switching


00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.640
is Pythonbytes.fm, which I requested


00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.680
after a 45 minute phone call,


00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.120
figured out why GoDaddy couldn't give me the access code


00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.640
to do the switch.


00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.000
I finally did this morning and I got it.


00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.100
But I hope everyone gets to hear from us after it switches.


00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.280
The reason, the whole reason to tell this story


00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.320
is that for some reason it stops working.


00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.160
It will be back.


00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.400
I apologize.


00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.360
I'll get it.


00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.720
I think it's going to go seamlessly.


00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.600
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.


00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.800
Fingers crossed for this one.


00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.320
- So we need to buy these stickers in bulk then.


00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.960
- We're going to zero days since it was DNS.


00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.040
It's always DNS.


00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.160
Yeah, so we need to get those ordered now.


00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.640
Mojo is asking where I ended up.


00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.080
I ended up, let me do it like this


00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.580
so I don't give away the joke.


00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.600
I ended up at hover.com.


00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.440
- Okay.


00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.760
- It's the one thing that they do.


00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.200
They don't do other stuff.


00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.600
They don't kill white rhinos for sport,


00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.400
nor do they not care about their DNS.


00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.240
It's like their job.


00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.320
So it seemed like a good place so far.


00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.160
Fingers crossed.


00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.480
Thank you, Robert.


00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.320
All right.


00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.160
So you already had probably the best joke for the show,


00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.360
but I've got a joke as well.


00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.200
You ready for it?


00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.160
- Okay, yeah.


00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.000
- Okay.


00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.820
- Oh, I love this.


00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.840
- So yeah, so Chris, no, Josh Collinsworth, sorry,


00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.840
came up with this thing


00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.920
and it looks like some kind of code he's written.


00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.840
It's over on code pen.io that generates these.


00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.440
So it's an honest LinkedIn notification generator.


00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.960
So you go to like your activity or your notifications


00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.040
and it tells you stuff.


00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.940
Well, this one tells you stuff that is more in line


00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.840
with the reality of LinkedIn


00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.120
rather than what LinkedIn wants to tell you.


00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.520
So here's a picture of this woman.


00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.640
It says, "Congratulate a near stranger for tears at a job


00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.880
you didn't know they had."


00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.720
- That's awesome.


00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.800
- Yeah, it's so good.


00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.080
There's like a blurred picture of somebody.


00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.480
It says, "Someone looked at your profile."


00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.320
Who?


00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.960
We're holding that information for ransom.


00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.400
It says, this smiling guy says,


00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.840
"Follow the worst coworker you've ever had


00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.340
for their sudden unsolicited insights."


00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.520
And it just goes on and on.


00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.140
I think it even has infinite scroll.


00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.920
"Somebody connected with your first manager


00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.560
from your job in 2014 reacted to a former classmates post.


00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.120
Thought you should know.


00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.000
Wannabe influencers shared an incredibly crappy opinion.


00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.160
Just for the engagement, click to engage."


00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.960
Never hire anyone who writes CSF, ever.


00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.600
No CSS.


00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.560
So on and so on.


00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.760
It's just, it's so good.


00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.960
"Wish that guy who made you cry in the bathroom


00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.800
a happy birthday."


00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.640
- That's great.


00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.480
Oh, good.


00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.920
There was a, did you already get the one


00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.400
where it was like free work, the free labor one?


00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.240
Oh yeah.


00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.080
- No, where is it?


00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:37.920
- No, right there.


00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.160
You're one of the few experts invited.


00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.000
- Oh yeah, yeah.


00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.960
You're one of the few experts invited to slash,


00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.640
do free unpaid labor.


00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.280
Rather, "Add to this collaborative article.


00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.560
How do you exploit users without them noticing?"


00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.280
- Well, I've been getting those like a whole bunch lately.


00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.400
And I actually clicked on it when I'm like,


00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.560
what are they talking about?


00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.400
Oh, they want me to write articles for free?


00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.880
No, I'm not doing that.


00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.160
I got one this morning even.


00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.560
So I got not one of these,


00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.280
but I got a congratulate John Gould on his new,


00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.480
or Gould on his new promotion.


00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.960
And I'm like, he owns the company.


00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.800
I don't understand.


00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.840
(laughing)


00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.200
- I don't understand.


00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.280
- Good little pat on the old back there, John.


00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.080
- Good job giving yourself a promotion there.


00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.040
- Exactly.


00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.960
Chris Taylor and 36 others at Soul Sucking Corporation


00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.440
shared this post from the CEO


00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.960
in hopes of avoiding the next round of layoffs.


00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.800
These are good.


00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.160
- Get a lot of those, yeah.


00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.960
- All right, well, I don't know if it's too dark,


00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.080
but that's what I brought for the joke.


00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:36.920
- I think it's great.


00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.080
- I think I do too.


00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.400
- I kind of like LinkedIn to like keep in touch with people


00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.480
and keep up your resume and stuff like that.


00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.160
But I don't actually ever use it


00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.920
as a finding new articles through that service.


00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.760
But anyway.


00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.640
- There's a whole group of people who do.


00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.920
I don't think I'm part of it either.


00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.640
- Yeah, I'm not the target audience.


00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.760
So it's all right.


00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.600
- Yeah.


00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.040
- All right, well, thanks again for a lovely Python Bytes.


00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.280
- Absolutely, bye.
