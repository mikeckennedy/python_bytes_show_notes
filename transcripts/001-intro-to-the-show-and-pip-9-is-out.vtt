00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.500
This is Python Bytes, episode number one, recorded Monday, November 7th, 2016.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:13.560
Hello, everybody, and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.980
This is one of your hosts, Michael Kennedy, along here with Brian Okken.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.960
Hey, Brian, how's it going?

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.860
It's going great.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.600
I'm super excited to be doing this podcast with you.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.240
I'm really thrilled to be bringing these little tidbits to everyone each week or biweekly,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.440
whatever we would decide to go with.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.480
Yeah, I'm really excited, too.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.500
I think this is definitely something that's missing out in the community right now.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.480
Yeah, the goal is you subscribe to Python Bytes.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.120
And if you listen every week, you'll basically get a lot of the top headlines that you need to know about.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.700
So let's jump right into the headlines.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.740
The first one that I want to talk about is PyData, specifically PyData from Washington, D.C.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.700
The videos for this conference are out.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.300
So if you didn't make it to PyData, D.C.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:07.060
And you want to check them out, there are 64 videos, which is about 30, 35 hours worth of content on YouTube right now.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:16.020
And so a couple of the videos that I thought were really great, you know, looking through them, where one of them was Elasticsearch and Redis, how and when to use them.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.980
And I don't really know too much about Elasticsearch.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.420
So I'm really excited to watch this video and learn more about it.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.580
Another one is the one by Renee Tate.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.540
She hosts a podcast and a website called Becoming a Data Scientist.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.160
And she did a talk on advice from her podcast guests about becoming a data scientist.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.220
So I think that's really cool.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.860
One that was also cool was visual diagnostics for more information about machine learning and basically tuning your machine learning.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:50.500
And then one about data reproducibility and scientific computing called You Got Your Engineering and My Data Science Addressing the Reproducibility Crisis.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.080
Yeah, I was really impressed with these videos.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.700
And there's a couple of things that I really liked about them.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.680
I like the format that shows you can see both the slides and the presenter on a little kind of a picture in picture sort of thing of the presenter talking as well.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.600
I think that was done well.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.900
I also really like the, man, these are like 35 minute or half an hour presentations and they're just packed with data.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.220
Yeah, it's not like people are trying to fill an hour, hour and a half.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.980
They're like, here's the essence, let's go.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.040
And it's really great.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.880
And, you know, I definitely agree with you on the quality.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm really, really impressed with all the Python conferences about how high quality their AV work is and how good of an effort they make to basically record and share, not just with the attendees, but with everybody, whatever went on there.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.220
Yeah, it's pretty impressive.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.300
All right, what do you got for us, Brian?

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.740
Oh, all right.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.460
One of the things that came up is another tutorial about EasyArgs.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.160
It's a command line, command line to library for making arguments better.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.840
I actually didn't take too much of a look at it.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:06.940
I just think it's one of the things I wanted to point out was it's kind of interesting that we have yet another way to make command line arguments easier to parse.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.180
I've lost track now of how many extra libraries there are.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.460
Yeah, let's see.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.560
Yeah.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.560
Let's see.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.720
Arg pars, click, doc opt, and a bunch more, right?

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.380
Yeah.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:28.880
It seemed, I was just thinking that it seems like a rite of passage now that, so if you're serious about being a Python developer and open source and blogging about it, you have to do two things.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.780
You have to write a tutorial about how generators work, and you have to make your own command line library.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.800
That's awesome.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.020
I think you might be right there.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.920
I haven't done either of those, but I actually do like, I'm making fun of it a little bit, but I'm glad that people are doing it.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:58.120
If everybody's trying to solve the problem, it means there's a lot of people not happy with the current solutions, and I'm one of those people that likes to write command line tools, so I say more power to them to write another.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.280
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.040
More power to them.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.500
That's awesome.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:09.660
So the next one that I wanted to talk about is something called safety-db, which is on GitHub, and of course, we'll put all the links to everything we're talking about in the show notes.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.040
You can check them out in your podcast player.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:21.500
But safety-db is interesting because when we write and deploy our applications, especially web applications because they have the biggest surface area and they touch the most people, right?

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.920
They're publicly out on a server.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.980
We don't just deploy our code.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.960
We deploy all the packages that we're using in our code and then the packages that those packages depend upon and so on.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.900
So, for example, on my training website, I've got a mailing list, and I use MailChimp for that.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.900
MailChimp itself depends upon DocOpt, speaking of command line parsers and so on.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.160
How do I keep track of all these things and know if there's a security vulnerability?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.020
Like, what if there's a problem in DocOpt that would let people hack into my server?

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.500
I didn't install DocOpt.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.900
Maybe it's not even on my mind.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.600
I don't even realize that it got installed.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:11.540
This GitHub set of data keeps that information current so I can check, hey, does my project have any vulnerabilities that I may or may not even be aware of through this sort of hierarchy of dependencies I'm using?

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.300
Wow.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.060
I didn't realize it was that in full.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.740
Yeah, so I'm just starting to get into more of the web development aspect of it.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.080
But I do, I mean, just even with what I do now, I depend on MailChimp and other services.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.880
I didn't even think about that, of looking at their vulnerabilities.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.200
Yeah, isn't that crazy?

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:40.380
There was something with one of the libraries that Flask is built upon a while ago that caused some big hoopla.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.360
And I'm sure it got patched right away and it was no big deal.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.380
But, you know, if you don't know that you need to go patch your system, that's a problem.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.020
So, SafetyDB.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.360
Yeah, great.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.740
Cool.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.400
I'll check it out.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.940
Check it out.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.620
All right.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.780
So, next up, we've got a GitHub project that came to my attention this week called Fast Style Transfer.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.780
And it's an interesting library that uses TensorFlow, which I've never used TensorFlow.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.960
Have you used TensorFlow, Mike?

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.000
No, I'm just starting to work on a project, a data science project that is probably using TensorFlow.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.240
But I've only heard good things.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.260
I have not yet used it.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.860
Okay.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:27.760
Well, this one is something that makes me want to give it a try because the demo on it looks really cool.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:36.420
You take a painting or a picture of some artist's style and you can apply that style to another picture, like your own picture.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.320
And I've seen something like that before.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.260
But what I'm really excited about is this will apply it to videos as well.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:53.160
And I've always, I guess, ever since the AHA's Take On Me video, I've liked that notion of like an artistic style over a short video.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.580
It just seems like fun.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.580
That sounds really fun.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.600
So, I could like take my training videos and turn them into like a Van Gogh type of thing?

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.100
Yeah.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.540
Yeah, that'd be great.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.200
That'd be awesome.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.640
I don't know if people could read your slides.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.200
But they would feel very creative while they're watching it.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.000
No, I can't think of actually any commercial reason why I would try this.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.260
But the artist in me wants to give it a shot.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.320
No, it sounds really cool.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.400
And a chance to play a TensorFlow.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.400
Also cool.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.780
Yeah.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.260
So, another big piece of news that came out this week is PIP.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.080
So, pip has a full new major version.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.540
PIP 9 is out.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.920
And it comes with a couple of new features.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.840
One is the ability to check the installed package dependencies to see if everything is set up correctly there.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.340
You can use pip show in a less verbose way.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:51.220
You can also say pip list and give it a not required option, which will show you all the packages that aren't there because they're a dependency on a thing.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.140
They're sort of top level, which is really cool.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.320
There's a ton of fixes that came as part of this release.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:06.700
And as you might expect with any major release of some new thing, four days later, pip 901 was released with five fixes for bugs that were introduced in pip 9.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.340
Yeah.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.200
And actually, the list of what's in pip 9 is big.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:12.960
It is big.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.860
And one of the things that is cool is there's features in there that I didn't even know existed.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.820
So, like, the pip check is, like, that's really cool.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.800
I'm excited about that.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.540
But also, they're changing the list format, or they're going to.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:35.460
So, if you do pip list now on 9, it'll give you a warning that in the future, the default format will be a column format.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.020
And the column format, you can add now with a --format equals column.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.940
And it's really easy to read.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.580
So, I'm excited about that.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:43.920
Yeah.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.720
I'm really excited that this is here as well.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.500
Packaging is such a foundational, important thing in the whole ecosystem.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.260
And so, anything that makes that better, I'm for it.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.980
Yeah.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:59.520
And I use, like most people, I'm using virtual environments all over the place.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.860
And keeping track of what's in every one of them is pretty cool.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.580
Yeah, it definitely is.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.480
Okay.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:12.920
So, I'm going to jump to one, the next topic that you brought up, which is a Reddit.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:23.760
Actually, it's a sort of a blog post and a Jupyter project about the new MacBook Pro and what Reddit users think of the MacBook Pro.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.520
And I, at first, you brought this up and I'm like, this is ridiculous.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.240
I know that everybody's upset, like half the people are upset and half the people are excited.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.440
But most of the people I talk to are developers and they're kind of ticked about all the changes of the MacBook Pro.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:48.100
But this Reddit article or this article about incorporating Reddit, it's not about the specifics of that.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.520
It's using sentiment.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:10:03.600
It's talking about sentiment analysis to analyze all the words used in these Reddit threads and try to determine from the words if people are excited or upset about it.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.420
And I had never even heard of sentiment analysis.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:14.040
So, I think it's neat to show a data analysis project that is topical on something that people are talking about right now.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.000
Yeah, because we all have a thing that we care about.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.500
Either we work for a company that makes a product or has some sort of public persona or we have an open source project.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.060
And it would be nice to know, are people liking my work?

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.340
And this ability to apply sentiment analysis to it, it sounds really cool.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.500
And I think the MacBook Pro is a great thing to just grab because it's timely.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:47.360
Yeah, and I think it'd be kind of neat to – it was interesting to apply it to that and probably safer than applying it to something like current politics because, you know, you don't want to get in the middle of that right now.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.320
No, no, no, no.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.120
It's T minus 28 hours or something.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.400
Nobody wants to get in the middle of that.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.080
Yeah, cool.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.860
So, I really thought that was neat as well.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.680
Personally, I have a MacBook Pro I'm holding out.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.400
I'm not buying this new one for a while.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.160
I'm going to see where this whole thing shakes out.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.700
Yeah, I guess I didn't want to get too much into it, but I was curious about that, if you were going to get a new one or not.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:14.140
No, I was ready to, you know, go customize it, turn all the knobs to 11 and say, ship it now.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:21.140
But it's just, you know, I think there's too many things that are kind of weird and there's not enough of a benefit, so I'm just going to stick with what I got.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.300
Yeah, I guess.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:28.620
And maybe I'm just not doing anything complicated because I'm on a couple-year-old MacBook Air.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.440
I just don't need very much power, I guess.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.300
Yeah, that's good news.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.400
Okay.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.620
All right, well, that rounds out our news items for the week.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.940
But, you know, what else?

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.760
What do you got going on?

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.980
I know you've got the Test of Code podcast going.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.100
You're working on a book.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.120
You just did some presentations at a conference.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.800
Why don't you tell people, like, what's the news around your life?

00:11:49.180 --> 00:12:02.040
Yeah, well, I'm very grateful for November to roll around because there's – I know that – I know a lot of people in startups and I guess I've heard that people are working in San Francisco and stuff, work like crazy hours.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.460
But I'm not used to that.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.520
I'm an older engineer and I like my 40-hour work weeks.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.280
But October has been insane.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.760
I've been doing our projects at work, which I can't talk about and most of the people listening wouldn't care about.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.940
But we've been doing, like, 60-hour weeks lately.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:25.400
And on top of that, I was doing the Pacific Northwest Software Quality Conference.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.200
And I got to talk about – it was a couple weeks ago.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.520
I got to talk at that conference.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.520
And that was a 90-minute talk.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.480
And that's actually when I was looking at the PyData videos.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:44.760
I was impressed with all the information people got out in 30 minutes because it's, like, three times the amount of content that I got out in, like, 90 minutes.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.600
So – but it was a good experience to talk.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:57.600
I'm actually kind of glad that my first conference experience was a long one because I sure got my jitters out of the way.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.340
And I'm excited to do a future one.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.320
And the book's coming along good.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.980
I'm working with an editor.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.620
And this upcoming book is focused on pytest alone.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.980
Yeah, that's excellent.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.820
What's the title so people know what to look for?

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.720
We don't have a title yet.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.020
The book about pytest.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.880
Yeah, the book about pytest.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:27.280
But I will definitely share more information with this podcast as it becomes available.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.440
Yeah, yeah, beautiful.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.620
How about you?

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.340
What's going on with you?

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:35.260
Well, I've been on an absolute terror of recording Talk Python in me episodes.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.780
I recorded six weeks' worth last week.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:44.880
So that's – given that I spend about 10 hours of research and prep time on each, that meant a very long week.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.560
But I'm really, really happy with what I got out.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.320
The next three that I have coming, you know, we talked about PIP.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.980
And there's actually a bit of a crisis in the Python ecosystem's core open source infrastructure.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:02.260
And so I'm doing a panel session, including the guy who works on PyPI and PIP, Donald Suft.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.680
And that's called Are We Failing to Fund Python's Core Infrastructure?

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.480
So that comes out this week and also did something which I love the title,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.960
parsing horrible things with Python with Eric Rose.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:20.320
And then Martin Peters, who is either the top or one of the top guys at Stack Overflow as a user,

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.860
a contributor, an answerer, has over half a million reputation in Python.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.160
And I talked to him about a bunch of the things going on with questions and answers

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.380
and hard problems that they found on Stack Overflow.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.180
And that's just super revealing.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.680
I've learned a ton by doing that.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.200
Wow.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.680
I can't wait to talk about these.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.740
Now, is Donald still on PIP?

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.520
Donald is still on PIP.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.680
But the short, short, short version is he was working at HP.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.240
HP went through a huge bunch of layoffs, cut his whole division.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.460
And by way of doing that, basically defunded PyPI.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.160
Wow.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.240
So there's other companies like Rackspace and a couple of others.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:08.420
I'm sorry, I'm forgetting the names that contribute tons of resources in terms of computing and server and bandwidth.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.080
Like the bandwidth and infrastructure charges for PyPI are $40,000 a month.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.880
Wow.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.380
But there's no funding for people to keep that infrastructure running.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.280
So anyway, that's what that show is about.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.600
I can't wait for that.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.220
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.160
Check it out if you guys are interested.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.800
All right.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.280
Oh, yeah.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.980
I forgot to mention, I do have, I did talk with Rafael Pierzina.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.180
I'm probably getting that wrong.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:34.940
But that's a podcast coming up for testing code focused on pytest and Cookie Cutter.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.820
So that's coming up soon.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:37.740
Absolutely.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.300
All right.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.580

I hope people enjoy it.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.980
I think it'll be fun, too.
