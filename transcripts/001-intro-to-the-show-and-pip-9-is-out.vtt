00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Python Bytes, episode number one, recorded Monday, November 7th, 2016.


00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.880
Hello, everybody, and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python headlines directly


00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.320
to your earbuds.


00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.000
This is one of your hosts, Michael Kennedy, along here with Brian Okken.


00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.280
Hey, Brian, how's it going?


00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.280
It's going great.


00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.080
I'm super excited to be doing this podcast with you.


00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.400
I'm really thrilled to be bringing these little tidbits to everyone each week or biweekly,


00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.440
we would decide to go with. Yeah I think I'm really excited too. I think the this


00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.040
is definitely something that's missing out in the community right now. Yeah the


00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.520
goal is you subscribe to Python Bytes and if you listen every week you'll


00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.740
basically get a lot of the top headlines that you need to know about. So let's


00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.720
jump right into the headlines. The first one that I want to talk about is PyData.


00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.520
Specifically PyData from Washington DC. The videos for this conference are out


00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.880
So if you didn't make it to Pi Data DC and you want to check them out there are 64 videos


00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.880
Which is about 30 35 hours worth of content on YouTube right now


00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.080
And so a couple of the videos that I I thought were really great


00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.960
You know looking through them where one of them was elastic search and redis how and when to use them


00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.960
And I don't really know too much about elastic search


00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.520
So I'm really excited to watch this video and learn more about it another ones the one by Renee Tate


00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.780
She hosts a podcast and a website called Becoming a Data Scientist and she did a talk on advice from her podcast


00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.680
guests about becoming a data scientist. So I think that's really cool. One that was also cool was visual diagnostics for more information and


00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.080
about machine learning and basically tuning your machine learning. And then one about data reproducibility and scientific


00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.560
computing called You Got Your Engineering to My Data Science Addressing the Reproducibility Crisis.


00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.680
Yeah, I was really impressed with these videos and I'm there's a couple things that I really liked about him


00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.000
I like the format that shows you can see both the slides and the presenter on a little a little


00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.500
Kind of a picture-in-picture sort of thing of the presenter talking as well. I think that was done. Well, I also really like the


00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.780
Man, these are like 35 minute or half an hour presentations and they're just packed with data


00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.480
Yeah, it's not like people are trying to fill an hour hour and a half. They're like, here's the essence


00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.440
let's go and it's really great and you know I definitely agree with you on the


00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.320
quality I'm I'm really really impressed with all the Python conferences about


00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.160
how high quality their AV work is and how how good of an effort they make to


00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.320
basically record and share not just with the attendees both everybody whatever


00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.080
went on there yeah it's pretty impressive right what do you got first


00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.560
Brian oh all right one of the things that I came up is another tutorial about


00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.800
easy args about it's a command line command line to library for making


00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.440
arguments better I actually didn't take too much of a look at it I just think


00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.880
it's one of the things I wanted to point out was it's kind of interesting that we


00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.880
have yet another way to make command-line arguments easier to parse


00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.000
I've lost track now of how many extra libraries there are


00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.360
Yeah, let's see, argpars, click, docopt, and a bunch more, right?


00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.280
Yeah, it seemed, I was just thinking that it seems like a rite of passage now that,


00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.720
so if you're serious about being a Python developer and open source and blogging about


00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.000
it, you have to do two things.


00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.220
You have to write a tutorial about how generators work, and you have to make your own command


00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.220
line library.


00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.220
That's awesome.


00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.540
I think you might be right there.


00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.140
I haven't done either of those but I actually do like, I'm making fun of it a little bit,


00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.380
but I'm glad that people are doing it.


00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.880
If everybody's trying to solve the problem, it means there's a lot of people not happy


00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.380
with the current solutions.


00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.740
And I'm one of those people that likes to write command line tools, so I say more power


00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.300
to them to write another.


00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.460
Yeah, absolutely.


00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.460
More power to them.


00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.460
That's awesome.


00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.900
So the next one I wanted to talk about is something called safety-db, which is on GitHub.


00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.620
And of course, we'll put all the links to everything we're talking about in the show notes.


00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.580
You can check them out in your podcast player. But safety-db is interesting because when we


00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.060
write and deploy our applications, especially web applications, because they have the biggest


00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.900
surface area and they touch the most people, right? They're publicly out on a server.


00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.740
We don't just deploy our code. We deploy all the packages that we're using in our code.


00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.180
and then the packages that those packages depend upon and so on.


00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.060
So for example, on my training website, I've got a mailing list and I use MailChimp for that.


00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.860
MailChimp itself depends upon DockOpt, speaking of command line parsers and so on.


00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.300
How do I keep track of all these things and know if there's a security vulnerability?


00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.380
Like what if there's a problem in DockOpt that would let people hack into my server?


00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.860
I didn't install DockOpt, maybe it's not even on my mind.


00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.620
I don't even realize that it got installed.


00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.340
this GitHub set of data keeps that information current so I can check,


00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.540
"Hey, does my project have any vulnerabilities that I may or may not even be aware of


00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.840
through this hierarchy of dependencies I'm using?"


00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.420
>> Wow. I didn't realize it was that in full.


00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.780
Yes, so I'm just starting to get into more of the web development aspect of it.


00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.540
But I do, I mean, just even with what I do now,


00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.520
I depend on MailChimp and other services.


00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.200
I didn't even think about that, of looking at their vulnerabilities.


00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.200
Yeah, isn't that crazy?


00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.000
And there was something with one of the libraries that Flask is built upon


00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.500
a while ago that caused some big hoopla,


00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.400
and I'm sure it got patched right away and was no big deal,


00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.000
but if you don't know that you need to go patch your system,


00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.400
that's a problem.


00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.400
So, safety DB.


00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.400
Yeah, great. Cool. I'll check it out.


00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.200
Check it out.


00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.120
Alright, so next up we've got a GitHub project that came to my attention this week called


00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.440
Fast Style Transfer.


00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.840
And it's an interesting library that uses TensorFlow, which I've never used TensorFlow.


00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.400
Have you used TensorFlow, Mike?


00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:16.520
No, I'm just starting to work on a project, a data science project that is probably using


00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.280
TensorFlow, but I've only heard good things.


00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.600
I have not yet used it.


00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.580
Okay, well this one is something that makes me want to give it a try because the demo


00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.440
on it looks really cool.


00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.680
You take a painting or a picture of some artist's style and you can apply that style to another


00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.960
picture like your own picture.


00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.680
And I've seen something like that before but what I'm really excited about is this will


00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.800
apply it to videos as well.


00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.240
And I've always, I guess ever since the AHA's "Take on Me" video, I've liked that notion


00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.240
of like an artistic style over a short video.


00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.660
It just seems like fun.


00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.640
- That sounds really fun.


00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.560
So I could like take my training videos


00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.880
and turn them into like a Van Gogh type of thing?


00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.000
- Yeah, that'd be great.


00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.840
I don't know if people could read your slides, but--


00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.480
- But they would feel very creative


00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.020
while they're watching it.


00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.880
- No, I can't think of actually any commercial reason


00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.000
why I would try this,


00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.360
but the artist in me wants to give it a shot.


00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.880
No, it sounds really cool and a chance to play a TensorFlow.


00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.880
Also cool.


00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.880
Yeah.


00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.640
So another big piece of news that came out this week is Pip.


00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.360
So pip has a full new major version.


00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.520
Pip 9 is out and comes with a couple of new features.


00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.680
One is the ability to check the installed package dependencies to see if everything


00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.200
is set up correctly there.


00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.780
You can use pip Show in a less verbose way.


00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.840
You can also say pip List and give it a not required option, which will show you all the


00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.960
packages that aren't there because of their dependency on a thing, they're sort of top


00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.360
level, which is really cool. There's a ton of fixes that came as part of this release,


00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.160
and as you might expect with any major release of some new thing, four days later, PIP-901


00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.000
was released with five fixes for bugs that were introduced in PIP-9.


00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.040
Yeah, and actually, the list of what's in PIP-9 is big.


00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.760
It is big.


00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.400
One of the things that is cool is there's features in there that I didn't even know existed.


00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.960
So like the pip check is like, that's really cool. I'm excited about that.


00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:31.160
But also they're changing the list format or they're going to. So if you do pip list now on 9,


00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.720
it'll give you a warning that in the future, the default format will be a column format.


00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.040
And the column format, you can add now with a --format equals column,


00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.400
and it's really easy to read. So I'm excited about that.


00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.560
Yeah, I'm really excited. This is here as well


00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.080
Packaging is such a foundational important thing in the whole ecosystem. And so anything that makes that better


00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.920
I'm all I'm for it. Yeah, and I'm I use a


00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.680
like most people I'm using virtual environments all over the place and


00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.480
Keeping track of what's what's in every one of them is pretty cool. Yeah, it definitely is


00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:11.880
Okay, so I'm gonna jump to one the next topic that you brought up which is a


00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:19.840
Reddit actually it's a it's a sort of a blog post and a Jupyter project about the new MacBook Pro and


00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.960
what Reddit users think of the MacBook Pro and


00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.560
I at first you brought this up, and I'm like this is ridiculous


00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.280
I know that everybody's up like half the people are upset and half the people are excited


00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.360
But most of the people I talk to our developers


00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.360
And they're kind of ticked about all the changes of the MacBook Pro


00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.860
But this reddit article or this article about


00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:49.600
Incorporating reddit. It's not about it's not about the specifics of that. It's using sentiment


00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:56.560
It's talking about sentiment analysis to analyze all the words used in these reddit threads and


00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:03.680
and and try to determine from this the words if people are excited or upset about it and


00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.960
I had never even heard of sentiment analysis. So I think it's neat to


00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.160
to show a data analysis project that is topical on something that people are


00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.720
talking about right now. Yeah, because we all have a thing that we care about.


00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.560
Either we work for a company that makes a product or has some sort of public


00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.760
persona or we have an open-source project and it would be nice to know are


00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.960
people liking my work and this ability to apply sentiment analysis to it


00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.360
sounds really cool and I think the MacBook Pro is a great thing to


00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.560
just grab because it's timely. Yeah, and I think it'd be kind of neat to...


00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.560
interesting to apply it to that and probably safer than applying it to


00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.480
something like current politics because you know you don't want to get in the


00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.480
middle of that right now. No no no it's t-minus 28 hours or something nobody


00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.200
wants to get in the middle of that. Yeah cool so I really thought that was neat


00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.760
as well. Personally I have a MacBook Pro I'm holding out I'm not buying this new


00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.120
one for a while I'm gonna see where this whole thing shakes out. Yeah I guess I


00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.040
didn't want to get it too much into it but I was curious about that if you were


00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.480
going to get a new one or not. No, I was ready to, you know, go customize it,


00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.440
turn all the knobs to 11 and say ship it now, but it's just, you know, I think


00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.440
there's too many things that are kind of weird and there's not enough of a


00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.320
benefit so I'm just gonna stick with what I got. Yeah, I guess, and I'm, maybe


00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.320
I'm just not doing anything complicated because I'm on a couple year old MacBook


00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.440
Air. I just don't need very much power I guess. So yeah, that's good news.


00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.900
- Okay. - All right, well,


00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.820
that rounds out our news items for the week,


00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.820
but what else, what do you got going on?


00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.160
I know you've got the Tested Code podcast going,


00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.180
you're working on a book,


00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.500
you just did some presentations at a conference.


00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.340
Why don't you tell people,


00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.180
like what's the news around your life?


00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.900
- Yeah, well, I'm very grateful for November to roll around


00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.220
because there's, I know that,


00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.300
I know a lot of people in startups


00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.820
and I guess I've heard that people are working


00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.140
in San Francisco and stuff, work like crazy hours,


00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.140
But I'm not used to that.


00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:09.640
I'm an older engineer and I like my 40-hour work weeks.


00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.340
But October has been insane.


00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:15.660
I've been doing our projects at work, which I can't talk about and most of the people


00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.960
listening wouldn't care about.


00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.480
But we've been doing like 60-hour weeks lately.


00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.780
And on top of that, I was doing the Pacific Northwest Software Quality Conference.


00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:31.080
And I got to talk about, it was a couple weeks ago, I got to talk at that conference.


00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.040
And that was a 90 minute talk and that's actually when I was looking at the Pydata videos, I


00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:41.500
was impressed with all the information people got out in 30 minutes because it's like three


00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.760
times the amount of content that I got out in like 90 minutes.


00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.000
But it was a good experience to talk.


00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.160
I'm actually kind of glad that my first conference experience was a long one because I sure got


00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.400
my jitters out of the way and I'm excited to do a future one. And the


00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.520
book's coming along good. I'm working with an editor and this


00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:12.560
upcoming book is on Pytest alone.


00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.920
That's excellent. What's the title so people know what to look for? We don't


00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:22.480
have a title yet. The book about Pytest. Yeah, the book about Pytest. But I


00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.600
I will definitely share more information with this podcast as it becomes available.


00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.280
>> I am.


00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.760
>> Hey, how about you? What's going on with you?


00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.440
>> Well, I've been on an absolute terror of recording Talk Python to me episodes.


00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.920
I recorded six weeks worth last week.


00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.200
So that's given that I spend about 10 hours of research and prep time on each.


00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.900
That meant a very long week,


00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.560
but I'm really, really happy with what I got out.


00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.160
The next three that I have coming,


00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.720
we talked about PIP,


00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.180
And there's actually a bit of a crisis in the Python's,


00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.180
Python ecosystem's core open source infrastructure.


00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.060
And so I'm doing a panel session,


00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.640
including the guy who works on PyPI and pipped on stuff.


00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.480
And that's called,


00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.760
"Are we failing to fund Python's core infrastructure?"


00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.160
So that comes out this week.


00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.680
And also did something which I love the title,


00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.040
"Parsing horrible things with Python with Eric Rose."


00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.680
And then Martin Peters,


00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.900
who is either the top or one of the top guys


00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.960
at Stack Overflow as a user, a contributor, an answerer,


00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.600
has over half a million reputation in Python.


00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.840
And I talked to him about a bunch of the things going on


00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.520
with questions and answers and hard problems


00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.520
that they found on Stack Overflow.


00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.320
And that's just super revealing.


00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.960
I've learned a ton by doing that.


00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.000
- Wow, I can't wait to talk about these.


00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.720
Now, is Donald still on pip or?


00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.640
- Donald is still on PIP,


00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.600
but the short, short, short version is


00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.160
He was working at HP.


00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.240
HP went through a huge bunch of layoffs,


00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.440
cut his whole division, and by way of doing that,


00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.960
basically defunded PyPI.


00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.800
- Wow.


00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.300
- So there's other companies like Rackspace


00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.720
and a couple of others, I'm sorry,


00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.540
I'm forgetting the names,


00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.460
that contribute tons of resources


00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.560
in terms of computing and server and bandwidth.


00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.780
Like the bandwidth and infrastructure charges


00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.720
for PyPI are $40,000 a month.


00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.560
- Wow.


00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.120
- But there's no funding for people


00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.580
to keep that infrastructure running.


00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.760
So anyway, that's what that show is about.


00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.920
- Well, I can't wait for that.


00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.440
- Yeah, yeah, check it out if you guys are interested.


00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.280
- All right.


00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.120
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention,


00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.200
I did talk with Rafael Pierzina,


00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.320
I'm probably getting that wrong,


00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.600
but that's a podcast coming up for testing code


00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.200
focused on pytest and Cookie Cutter.


00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.340
So that's coming up soon.


00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.180
- Absolutely.


00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.800
All right, well, thank you everybody


00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.040
