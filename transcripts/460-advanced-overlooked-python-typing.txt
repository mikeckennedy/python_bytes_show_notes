00:00:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05 <v Michael Kennedy>This is episode 460, recorded, unbelievably, December 1st.

00:00:12 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:13 <v Michael Kennedy>And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:14 <v Michael Kennedy>And this episode is brought to you by us, especially Black Friday things that we have on offer.

00:00:21 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't know, it's been a great Black Friday for me.

00:00:23 <v Michael Kennedy>A lot of people really interested in the stuff that I put together, hopefully for you as well, Brian.

00:00:28 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I kind of forgot about Black Friday.

00:00:30 <v Brian Okken>Well, the Black Friday has been going good.

00:00:31 <v Brian Okken>What I forgot about was Cyber Monday.

00:00:33 <v Brian Okken>So I did add today so people can use Cyber Monday code for the course today.

00:00:41 <v Brian Okken>But yeah, I just added that this morning.

00:00:44 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, people can look for an email from me if they're signed up to the newsletters.

00:00:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Is your stuff, what's yours through?

00:00:51 <v Michael Kennedy>Is it through today?

00:00:53 <v Michael Kennedy>I think I'm going to have it end just tomorrow morning.

00:00:57 <v Michael Kennedy>So in case people are like, oh, no, I always get emails like, I missed it by an hour.

00:01:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Or just let it go another day and then turn it off.

00:01:04 <v Brian Okken>So if you're not watching this live, you're kind of SOL.

00:01:06 <v Brian Okken>Sorry.

00:01:08 <v Michael Kennedy>No, I mean, they can listen today.

00:01:10 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, this is timely news.

00:01:12 <v Michael Kennedy>People have got to stay on top of Python by saying can't let it accumulate.

00:01:16 <v Michael Kennedy>No, it's fine if you listen backwards.

00:01:17 <v Michael Kennedy>There's a lot of stuff that's not that timely.

00:01:19 <v Michael Kennedy>But one of my topics certainly is.

00:01:21 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, yeah, that's going good.

00:01:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Subscribe to the newsletter.

00:01:25 <v Michael Kennedy>Follow us on the socials.

00:01:27 <v Michael Kennedy>Make sure to subscribe here on YouTube as well if you're interested in catching that.

00:01:32 <v Michael Kennedy>We intend the podcast to be an audio podcast.

00:01:35 <v Michael Kennedy>But while we're doing the live stream, we do put stuff up on the screen.

00:01:38 <v Michael Kennedy>And sometimes it helps to see it, you know, even though we do our best to keep it audio friendly.

00:01:42 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:01:43 <v Michael Kennedy>Speaking of putting stuff on the screen, what do you got for us, Brian?

00:01:47 <v Brian Okken>Well, today is December 1st, and that means that it's the first day of Advent of Code.

00:01:52 <v Brian Okken>So I want to look to see how long this has been going on.

00:01:57 <v Brian Okken>And I guess I don't.

00:01:58 <v Brian Okken>I'll have to look harder.

00:01:59 <v Brian Okken>I don't know how long this has been going on.

00:02:01 <v Brian Okken>This is, so what this is, it's code puzzles that you can do in any language.

00:02:08 <v Brian Okken>The intent is to do them in any language.

00:02:09 <v Brian Okken>But of course, our listeners are probably doing them in Python.

00:02:12 <v Brian Okken>Maybe Rust this year.

00:02:13 <v Brian Okken>Who knows?

00:02:14 <v Brian Okken>But this is from Eric.

00:02:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Assembly as a stretch goal?

00:02:17 <v Michael Kennedy>Come on.

00:02:17 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:02:20 <v Brian Okken>This is from Eric Wassel.

00:02:22 <v Brian Okken>And I really appreciate it.

00:02:24 <v Brian Okken>This year's a couple changes.

00:02:26 <v Brian Okken>There's no, let's see, there's 12 days.

00:02:28 <v Brian Okken>And actually, I'm kind of grateful because I've never actually gotten through all 25.

00:02:34 <v Brian Okken>And I might, or 24, or how many of them anywhere.

00:02:37 <v Brian Okken>But so I'm kind of grateful for a shorter one.

00:02:40 <v Brian Okken>So I can take a couple days to try them out.

00:02:42 <v Brian Okken>I might try this year.

00:02:44 <v Brian Okken>And there's, what are the other couple changes?

00:02:47 <v Brian Okken>There's the global leaderboard has gone away for maintenance reasons.

00:02:52 <v Brian Okken>So I do appreciate, it's one of the things is we should say thanks for people doing cool stuff.

00:02:57 <v Brian Okken>So Adventic culture is cool.

00:02:59 <v Brian Okken>It is sponsored.

00:03:00 <v Brian Okken>There are some sponsors that have helped keep this going.

00:03:04 <v Brian Okken>But one of the things I noticed this year, and maybe it's been there and I just haven't noticed,

00:03:08 <v Brian Okken>is there's a swag page.

00:03:12 <v Brian Okken>You can go look at some cool stuff and you can grab a mug or a shirt or something kind of fun.

00:03:20 <v Brian Okken>One of the things I kind of like about it is it's not, <v Brian Okken>the year isn't on there.

00:03:24 <v Brian Okken>So this can be one that you can just, <v Brian Okken>you can pull out and wear every year around Christmas.

00:03:30 <v Brian Okken>Evergreen swag.

00:03:31 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I like it.

00:03:33 <v Brian Okken>So fun thing.

00:03:34 <v Brian Okken>I'd love to hear if other people are using <v Brian Okken>or doing the Advent of Code this year.

00:03:40 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I'd like to hear about how it's going.

00:03:44 <v Brian Okken>Another kind of associated with this, <v Brian Okken>I saw this up on Reddit.

00:03:49 <v Brian Okken>Somebody wrote a, I know there's been other helpers out there, but there is a Python project that is called Elf, which is a modern advent of code helper that fetches inputs, submits answers and tracks your progress.

00:04:03 <v Brian Okken>So we're going to link to that as well.

00:04:05 <v Brian Okken>Just saw this.

00:04:08 <v Brian Okken>Oh, they've been working on it for a few months, getting ready for it.

00:04:11 <v Brian Okken>That's cool.

00:04:12 <v Brian Okken>So Elf is a command line interface to kind of play with the advent of code stuff.

00:04:17 <v Brian Okken>So we'll link to that as well.

00:04:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, very cool. The advent of code stuff is interesting, but I've never really put much time and energy into it personally. I just have so many projects that I have ideas for and I want to build and I can't even focus on them. So it's like, it is cool. I'm personally thankful for surviving Hocktoberfest without 10 PRs suggesting that I put a comma in my readme.

00:04:45 <v Michael Kennedy>Did you get any?

00:04:46 <v Michael Kennedy>No, I used to.

00:04:47 <v Michael Kennedy>I used to get a bunch.

00:04:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, hey, we've improved your readme.

00:04:50 <v Michael Kennedy>And it's like, you're looking to do a PR is what you're looking to do.

00:04:54 <v Michael Kennedy>You're just wasting my time.

00:04:56 <v Michael Kennedy>But actually, no, maybe people put up rules around it or they just put up admonishment.

00:05:02 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, please don't bother people like that.

00:05:04 <v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, not this year.

00:05:05 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, cool.

00:05:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's talk about Django, huh?

00:05:10 <v Michael Kennedy>That's what I want to cover next.

00:05:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, Django.

00:05:13 <v Michael Kennedy>And what's cool is Django is coming up with a major new release.

00:05:20 <v Michael Kennedy>They're knocking out the versions pretty quickly.

00:05:23 <v Michael Kennedy>And as I did point out at the opening, this is expected December 2025.

00:05:28 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'm expecting this any moment now, Brian.

00:05:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:05:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Seriously, Django 6 has some really cool features, actually some genuinely useful ones.

00:05:36 <v Michael Kennedy>The first thing I want to point out about it is how aggressive they are at saying no to older versions.

00:05:42 <v Michael Kennedy>Like no old Python.

00:05:44 <v Michael Kennedy>They only support Python 3.12 and above.

00:05:46 <v Michael Kennedy>That's pretty hardcore, honestly.

00:05:49 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, but it's an application.

00:05:51 <v Brian Okken>So you get to decide.

00:05:53 <v Brian Okken>It's not like if you're building on top of Django, <v Brian Okken>you have to support backwards compatible stuff.

00:05:59 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, but you may have a five-year-old Django app <v Michael Kennedy>you want to upgrade that has some weird dependency

00:06:05 <v Michael Kennedy>that goes up to 3.10.

00:06:06 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:06:07 <v Michael Kennedy>And I'm not saying this is a bad thing.

00:06:10 <v Michael Kennedy>I think this is awesome.

00:06:11 <v Michael Kennedy>I think there's a lot of benefit that people are missing out.

00:06:15 <v Michael Kennedy>Like when I did the year in review sort of thing, <v Michael Kennedy>article at JetBrains earlier this year,

00:06:21 <v Michael Kennedy>one of the areas I worked on and like sort of did a bunch of math

00:06:25 <v Michael Kennedy>and like predictions or stats on or whatever <v Michael Kennedy>was this what version of Python are people running on?

00:06:32 <v Michael Kennedy>And a huge bunch of people are still running on 310 or older.

00:06:36 <v Michael Kennedy>And your code is so much faster and uses less memory <v Michael Kennedy>and just so much better.

00:06:40 <v Michael Kennedy>Like forget the new features that you get to use.

00:06:43 <v Michael Kennedy>Just literally it's like 50% faster or something <v Michael Kennedy>just by changing what version of Python you're running on.

00:06:50 <v Michael Kennedy>And this sort of encourages the Python people who also Django

00:06:53 <v Michael Kennedy>to ride at the further out on the edge of that wave, I suppose,

00:06:57 <v Michael Kennedy>which is really good because, yeah, it definitely helps.

00:07:01 <v Michael Kennedy>So 5.2 is the last one to support, 3.10 and 3.11.

00:07:04 <v Michael Kennedy>So they dropped two years worth of Python in one year.

00:07:06 <v Michael Kennedy>Pretty good.

00:07:08 <v Michael Kennedy>So features, content security policy.

00:07:11 <v Michael Kennedy>We all do not love our cross-site scripting and other badnesses.

00:07:15 <v Michael Kennedy>So it comes now with a built-in support for the content security policy standard.

00:07:21 <v Michael Kennedy>So that's cool.

00:07:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Avoid CSS or XSS and those kinds of things.

00:07:26 <v Michael Kennedy>Just install it and configure it.

00:07:28 <v Michael Kennedy>Basically, it sets some headers, which then tell the web browsers how they're allowed to behave, cross-site, and that kind of thing.

00:07:34 <v Michael Kennedy>Another one, I feel like this one probably has Carlton Gibson fingerprints on it here,

00:07:40 <v Michael Kennedy>is they now have template partials.

00:07:43 <v Michael Kennedy>This is super cool.

00:07:44 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'm really surprised how much HTMX, the JavaScript where you run in framework,

00:07:51 <v Michael Kennedy>where you write no JavaScript sort of thing, is how popular it has become in Django.

00:07:56 <v Michael Kennedy>It's featured in a lot of talks and stuff.

00:07:59 <v Michael Kennedy>And one of the things that you really, really need to focus on

00:08:02 <v Michael Kennedy>when you're doing that kind of programming is how do I take portions of my page and then return them

00:08:08 <v Michael Kennedy>from server-side code. And you can end up with lots of duplication or other weirdnesses. So this

00:08:14 <v Michael Kennedy>basically addresses that if you want to return a fragment of a page, then you can say, I know here's

00:08:19 <v Michael Kennedy>the whole page, the whole template of HTML markup with a Django syntax. But in this view, when somebody

00:08:27 <v Michael Kennedy>makes this request, I want to return just this portion of it.

00:08:30 <v Michael Kennedy>And you can even do things like, is the request coming in a regular request?

00:08:35 <v Michael Kennedy>We'll return the whole page.

00:08:36 <v Michael Kennedy>No, is it an HTMLX partial request?

00:08:38 <v Michael Kennedy>Then just return the partial.

00:08:40 <v Michael Kennedy>So this is really, really valuable and basically makes those kinds of frameworks that exchange

00:08:44 <v Michael Kennedy>partial bits of HTML, regardless of whether it's HTML, nicer.

00:08:48 <v Michael Kennedy>That's pretty cool.

00:08:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:08:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Another really nice one is a background tasks.

00:08:52 <v Michael Kennedy>So just a thread that cruises around in the background that you can throw stuff at.

00:08:57 <v Michael Kennedy>way more useful than you would think.

00:09:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Sometimes you want to process something <v Michael Kennedy>that takes a little bit longer,

00:09:04 <v Michael Kennedy>but you don't want to block up the request response.

00:09:07 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, hey, I want to sign up for your newsletter.

00:09:09 <v Michael Kennedy>If you want to send them a welcome to my newsletter <v Michael Kennedy>or whatever email, you could on that request block

00:09:16 <v Michael Kennedy>and let it sit there and spin, <v Michael Kennedy>fire up your email API, connect, send,

00:09:21 <v Michael Kennedy>wait for that actually to send, get a response back <v Michael Kennedy>and then say, welcome, we've sent you an email, right?

00:09:26 <v Michael Kennedy>That's one way, but that makes your code potentially slow.

00:09:30 <v Michael Kennedy>It'd be nice to go instantly, hey, thanks for signing up.

00:09:34 <v Michael Kennedy>You're on the newsletter.

00:09:36 <v Michael Kennedy>And then kick off a task to the background, like send that person an email.

00:09:40 <v Michael Kennedy>For one email, it's not that big of a deal.

00:09:41 <v Michael Kennedy>If you've got to send a lot or do a bunch of stuff, it can time out your web requests.

00:09:46 <v Michael Kennedy>You get normally 20 seconds or something like that.

00:09:48 <v Michael Kennedy>And if it takes longer than that, it's a problem.

00:09:50 <v Michael Kennedy>Of course, people are going to be freaked out and reload or whatever as well.

00:09:54 <v Michael Kennedy>But anyway, this is like a real simple way <v Michael Kennedy>so you don't have to run other servers and message queues

00:10:00 <v Michael Kennedy>and all that kind of stuff.

00:10:01 <v Michael Kennedy>You just put it in the background of your app and let it go.

00:10:03 <v Michael Kennedy>It's not as durable, but it's great.

00:10:05 <v Brian Okken>Almost every app needs some sort of background task.

00:10:07 <v Brian Okken>So this is awesome that it's included now.

00:10:10 <v Michael Kennedy>It's cool that it's included, absolutely.

00:10:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Speaking of email, email handling in Django <v Michael Kennedy>now uses the Python's modern API introduced in 3.6

00:10:18 <v Michael Kennedy>using email.message.emailmessage.

00:10:20 <v Michael Kennedy>Super cool.

00:10:21 <v Michael Kennedy>Easier to send that way.

00:10:22 <v Michael Kennedy>and then a bunch of minor features that I'm not going to go into.

00:10:25 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, that's a pretty big set of releases or features for a year.

00:10:30 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:10:30 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, so now we have to see how many people are going to update

00:10:34 <v Brian Okken>all of their Django books and tutorials and everything, <v Brian Okken>Django 6.

00:10:41 <v Brian Okken>It's both an opportunity and a bit of a challenge.

00:10:44 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:10:45 <v Brian Okken>So Django's not a-- that isn't just a year, though, is it?

00:10:50 <v Brian Okken>Doesn't there is the release cycle like a year and a half or two years or something like that?

00:10:54 <v Brian Okken>Let's see.

00:10:55 <v Michael Kennedy>I feel like, where's the release?

00:10:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Here we go.

00:10:58 <v Michael Kennedy>It's yearly.

00:10:59 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it's yearly.

00:11:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:11:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, yeah.

00:11:01 <v Michael Kennedy>Hold on.

00:11:02 <v Michael Kennedy>It depends on what you call.

00:11:03 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, what is the version bump?

00:11:05 <v Michael Kennedy>There is a release every year, but it's not always a major version bump.

00:11:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, 6 is coming, but then 6.1 and 6.2 are planned.

00:11:12 <v Michael Kennedy>And I think 6.2 might be the LTS.

00:11:15 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:11:15 <v Michael Kennedy>So it bumps between LTSs.

00:11:17 <v Michael Kennedy>And the LTSs are on a three-year cycle.

00:11:20 <v Michael Kennedy>long-term support so you're not forced to keep rolling to get security fixes and stuff yeah

00:11:24 <v Brian Okken>yeah and i think that's because of some deprecation uh stuff and everything so

00:11:29 <v Brian Okken>all right cool gotta love advancements in django yep um okay well i um i'm gonna look take a look

00:11:36 <v Brian Okken>at some typing stuff how's that sound i love typing let's do it um so there's a there's an article

00:11:42 <v Brian Okken>um called advanced overlooked python typing and there's some goodies in here that i didn't know

00:11:48 <v Brian Okken>about, which is cool.

00:11:49 <v Brian Okken>So I was slow to come on board with typing, <v Brian Okken>but I like all of the extra.

00:11:54 <v Brian Okken>I'm kind of a fan now.

00:11:56 <v Brian Okken>Plus, it only takes having one package that's kind of popular

00:12:00 <v Brian Okken>that people will demand that you--

00:12:02 <v Brian Okken>so anyway, so some cool extra things <v Brian Okken>if you possibly may not have known about.

00:12:09 <v Brian Okken>The first I'll jump into is--

00:12:12 <v Brian Okken>oh, there's a disclaimer here that it says <v Brian Okken>that it's looking at modern stuff.

00:12:16 <v Brian Okken>So Python 312 or 313 or newer for some of this stuff.

00:12:22 <v Brian Okken>So assert never.

00:12:23 <v Brian Okken>I didn't know this was a thing.

00:12:25 <v Brian Okken>So let's say you've got a match case thing like switches.

00:12:31 <v Brian Okken>And you've got your catch all at the end.

00:12:33 <v Brian Okken>And you want to never hit that.

00:12:36 <v Brian Okken>Usually I'll throw an assert there or something just in case.

00:12:40 <v Brian Okken>But there's an assert never.

00:12:42 <v Brian Okken>That comes from typing.

00:12:44 <v Brian Okken>Didn't know that was there.

00:12:45 <v Brian Okken>that you can make sure that this default case has never hit,

00:12:49 <v Brian Okken>or if you have other cases that should never be hit.

00:12:51 <v Brian Okken>Throw that in there.

00:12:52 <v Brian Okken>That's cool.

00:12:53 <v Brian Okken>Didn't know that existed.

00:12:55 <v Brian Okken>There's getArgs.

00:12:56 <v Brian Okken>And the idea around getArgs is, <v Brian Okken>oh, this is a little small,

00:13:00 <v Brian Okken>so I'm going to see if I can make this a little bigger.

00:13:04 <v Brian Okken>The idea around getArgs is, <v Brian Okken>so if you've got,

00:13:10 <v Brian Okken>like here we've got frozen sets to have literals.

00:13:13 <v Brian Okken>There's literals before, <v Brian Okken>but you kind of had to have a duplication of all the actual literals for typing for different things.

00:13:22 <v Brian Okken>And that's in a set of literals, and that's sort of a pain.

00:13:25 <v Brian Okken>So instead of that, you can do get args, which creates essentially a set of literals for types, for things that are in something.

00:13:37 <v Brian Okken>So you kind of have to see the code here to understand that.

00:13:40 <v Brian Okken>It helps with keeping it in line so that when you create an extra element in your set, it automatically gets an extra type.

00:13:51 <v Brian Okken>TypeGuard we've covered before.

00:13:53 <v Brian Okken>I think we've covered it.

00:13:55 <v Brian Okken>It gets you the exact type-narrowing logic.

00:13:59 <v Brian Okken>I haven't used TypeGuard a lot, but there's sort of a pickier version.

00:14:04 <v Brian Okken>Type is a stricter and more prophesied type-narrowing than TypeGuard.

00:14:09 <v Brian Okken>by enabling bidirectional narrowing.

00:14:11 <v Brian Okken>Okay, so kind of fun with type is.

00:14:14 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, some extra, <v Brian Okken>oh, we've got unpacking and concatenation for callables.

00:14:22 <v Brian Okken>Oh, callable with dot, dot.

00:14:23 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, a lot of goodies for if you want to like <v Brian Okken>really get into some of the nitty gritty

00:14:28 <v Brian Okken>and some of the extra fun things with typing.

00:14:30 <v Brian Okken>This is a fun article.

00:14:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, very nice.

00:14:32 <v Michael Kennedy>I actually have an interesting one to add to that <v Michael Kennedy>is no return.

00:14:37 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, really?

00:14:38 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:14:39 <v Michael Kennedy>So you can go to a function and you can say arrow, I mean, goes to int,

00:14:43 <v Michael Kennedy>goes to stir, goes to optional customer, whatever.

00:14:47 <v Michael Kennedy>You can even say it returns none, which is literally it returns none.

00:14:51 <v Michael Kennedy>But no return is, it's not like a void.

00:14:54 <v Michael Kennedy>It's different.

00:14:55 <v Michael Kennedy>It basically says the only way that this function exits is through an exception.

00:15:00 <v Michael Kennedy>There's no way out of it.

00:15:01 <v Michael Kennedy>So you might have a while application is still running.

00:15:05 <v Michael Kennedy>And then in some case, if it decides it needs to stop, it raises an aborted, task aborted exception.

00:15:11 <v Michael Kennedy>And it's like, while true, if exit, raise task aborted.

00:15:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Like there's no regular way out.

00:15:16 <v Michael Kennedy>The only way out is through an exception than this.

00:15:20 <v Michael Kennedy>So you might think, why would I ever do that?

00:15:22 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, some of the web frameworks, when you do a redirect, the way they do the redirect is they raise an HTTP redirect sort of exception type thing,

00:15:30 <v Michael Kennedy>which is more likely to just like make it get all the way out right away rather than if you forget

00:15:36 <v Michael Kennedy>to say return redirect, right? Something like that. So you'd put a no return there. Isn't that a weird

00:15:40 <v Brian Okken>one? Yeah. Yeah. So I would have expected like one of the commenters, I thought no return was

00:15:47 <v Brian Okken>equivalent to return none. So if you don't have a return, that's not what it means. I'm like, oh,

00:15:54 <v Michael Kennedy>this is a really cool way to say it only returns none ever, which is the case if you never, if you

00:15:59 <v Michael Kennedy>don't say the keyword return, it still returns none.

00:16:01 <v Michael Kennedy>But no, this says the only way it gets out <v Michael Kennedy>is through exceptions.

00:16:07 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it was weird, right?

00:16:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Timing module, annotate functions that never return normally.

00:16:11 <v Michael Kennedy>I wanted a void.

00:16:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Where's my void?

00:16:15 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:16:16 <v Michael Kennedy>There's nothing coming out of this.

00:16:17 <v Michael Kennedy>This is not it, but this is something else in that realm

00:16:21 <v Michael Kennedy>of advanced type.

00:16:21 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, and those things do exist.

00:16:23 <v Brian Okken>So yeah, interesting.

00:16:25 <v Michael Kennedy>They sure do.

00:16:26 <v Michael Kennedy>So you know what else exists is misspellings.

00:16:29 <v Michael Kennedy>So I got on my Talk Python in production book, <v Michael Kennedy>Christian Klaus was kind enough to send me a message saying,

00:16:34 <v Michael Kennedy>hey, you know, so you may have some misspellings.

00:16:38 <v Michael Kennedy>And he sent me this thing, right?

00:16:40 <v Michael Kennedy>As a PR.

00:16:41 <v Michael Kennedy>However, it says fixed typos discovered by code spell,

00:16:46 <v Michael Kennedy>all one word, code spell.

00:16:47 <v Michael Kennedy>- Okay. - Wait, <v Michael Kennedy>what is this code spell?

00:16:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, code spell is a tool that checks <v Michael Kennedy>for common misspellings in source code.

00:16:55 <v Michael Kennedy>It works on other files as well, <v Michael Kennedy>but it especially works on different types of source files

00:17:01 <v Michael Kennedy>'cause it ignores backslash escapes <v Michael Kennedy>and other things that are common in code.

00:17:07 <v Michael Kennedy>But it's not a spell checker.

00:17:09 <v Michael Kennedy>It's a misspelling finder, let's say.

00:17:12 <v Michael Kennedy>So what it does is it goes and it says, <v Michael Kennedy>I'm gonna look for words that are commonly misspelled.

00:17:17 <v Michael Kennedy>Like in my example, what two things had I misspelled.

00:17:20 <v Michael Kennedy>I had FOM instead of from, F-O-M.

00:17:23 <v Michael Kennedy>had plausible with able instead of able on it. Right. So it looks for common misspellings. It

00:17:29 <v Michael Kennedy>doesn't look for words. It doesn't know because those are super annoying. You're like, here's

00:17:34 <v Michael Kennedy>723 misspellings. Like, no, those are acronyms. You know what I mean? Yeah. like that is a

00:17:40 <v Michael Kennedy>library I'm importing. It's not misspelled. If I change it, it doesn't work. Right. Like that

00:17:45 <v Michael Kennedy>kind of stuff. So what this does is it looks for like common misspellings, like ADN or,  TEH

00:17:51 <v Michael Kennedy>or what, you know, stuff like that.

00:17:53 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, there's not a whole lot more to say about it <v Michael Kennedy>other than it's pretty cool, it's configurable,

00:17:56 <v Michael Kennedy>you can like put words that are, you know, <v Michael Kennedy>learn the spelling equivalents

00:18:00 <v Michael Kennedy>and put other types of config files and whatnot.

00:18:04 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, this is cool.

00:18:05 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, you can even put it into a pyproject.toml <v Michael Kennedy>in settings if you wish.

00:18:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Cool.

00:18:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it's got 2.3,000, 2,300 GitHub stars.

00:18:13 <v Michael Kennedy>So yeah, pretty popular actually.

00:18:15 <v Brian Okken>As somebody that uses a code editor <v Brian Okken>exclusively for all of my text writing needs.

00:18:22 <v Michael Kennedy>This will be good.

00:18:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, indeed.

00:18:24 <v Michael Kennedy>I think Christian even set it up as a pre-commit hook.

00:18:28 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, that's a good idea.

00:18:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Which is kind of interesting <v Michael Kennedy>because it's apparently pretty fast.

00:18:32 <v Michael Kennedy>I think this is the one we were talking about.

00:18:34 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it has like, there's something about pre-commit

00:18:36 <v Michael Kennedy>like right there in the last commit.

00:18:38 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'm guessing it does something with that.

00:18:40 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:18:40 <v Michael Kennedy>How are you feeling on your extras?

00:18:42 <v Michael Kennedy>I got a few extras.

00:18:44 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:18:45 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, go for it.

00:18:46 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:18:47 <v Brian Okken>Let's see.

00:18:47 <v Brian Okken>I'll start with Hatch.

00:18:50 <v Brian Okken>So Hatch 1.16 came out.

00:18:54 <v Brian Okken>So some exciting features of Hatch.

00:18:59 <v Brian Okken>So for Hatch backends and Hatch itself, what do we got?

00:19:04 <v Brian Okken>We got dependency groups and there are workspaces.

00:19:08 <v Brian Okken>So workspaces allow you to, like if you have a monorepo <v Brian Okken>and you have a bunch of different projects within a monorepo,

00:19:14 <v Brian Okken>this might help with that.

00:19:16 <v Brian Okken>And then there's one, this is interesting.

00:19:19 <v Brian Okken>It supports software bill of materials now.

00:19:22 <v Brian Okken>So that's going to be, that's becoming a growing thing.

00:19:25 <v Brian Okken>So update to Hatch and another update on a different project we talked about last week.

00:19:32 <v Brian Okken>Was it last week?

00:19:32 <v Brian Okken>We talked about in one of the things we talked about was Zensicle.

00:19:37 <v Brian Okken>And a listener over on Mastodon, Fasodon said, <v Brian Okken>one of the things we forgot to mention is Zensicle is a replacement for MakeDocs

00:19:46 <v Brian Okken>plus, what was it, material theme?

00:19:49 <v Brian Okken>And also one of the things they talked about <v Brian Okken>was MakeDocs doesn't seem like it's been maintained

00:19:55 <v Brian Okken>since the middle of 2024.

00:19:57 <v Brian Okken>So there's a link in here to, <v Brian Okken>is MakeDocs still maintained?

00:20:02 <v Brian Okken>And I scrolled.

00:20:04 <v Brian Okken>It's an interesting read, <v Brian Okken>but I kind of think the answer is maybe-ish,

00:20:11 <v Brian Okken>but maybe not.

00:20:15 <v Brian Okken>So if you always have to, <v Michael Kennedy>you always have to split that difference of like,

00:20:19 <v Michael Kennedy>it could just be done, <v Michael Kennedy>you know, <v Michael Kennedy>certain things are just,

00:20:22 <v Michael Kennedy>they really don't need more and they're supposed to be simple,

00:20:24 <v Michael Kennedy>but I feel like MK docs is something that could continually take on new

00:20:28 <v Michael Kennedy>variations and features and updates.

00:20:30 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:20:32 <v Brian Okken>So not even to say no, <v Brian Okken>we're not longer being maintained.

00:20:36 <v Brian Okken>Is this the, <v Brian Okken>anyway, <v Brian Okken>interesting read if you're curious and want to depend on that,

00:20:40 <v Brian Okken>but I think I'll be, <v Brian Okken>I'll be checking out Zensicle as well.

00:20:43 <v Michael Kennedy>Right.

00:20:43 <v Michael Kennedy>And as you pointed out last week, you said, <v Michael Kennedy>for sure that it's a rewrite.

00:20:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Zensicle is not just building on MKDocs.

00:20:52 <v Michael Kennedy>It's just the people that were working on material for MKDocs

00:20:55 <v Michael Kennedy>are now building a completely from scratch documentation thing, right?

00:20:59 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, it's backwards compatible if you used MKDocs before,

00:21:03 <v Brian Okken>but it is something completely different.

00:21:05 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:21:07 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:21:07 <v Michael Kennedy>How about, do you have any extras?

00:21:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Or something completely different?

00:21:10 <v Michael Kennedy>I do.

00:21:10 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's go back to, was it last week or week before?

00:21:13 <v Michael Kennedy>I talked about TAC, T-A-C-H, and how it creates one of those basically architectural layered

00:21:21 <v Michael Kennedy>graphs that let you show which parts of your app depend upon which other parts of your app,

00:21:25 <v Michael Kennedy>that kind of thing.

00:21:26 <v Michael Kennedy>And it was pointed out that, hey, hey, that thing looks kind of unmaintained.

00:21:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, Gerber Decker sent me a message and says, TAC has been unmaintained for a bit,

00:21:37 <v Michael Kennedy>but it's not anymore.

00:21:39 <v Michael Kennedy>It was the main project of Gage, which is a Y Combinator startup that pivoted to something

00:21:43 <v Michael Kennedy>unrelated and based on AI, surprise, surprise. And they abandoned TAC. However, detached head from

00:21:49 <v Michael Kennedy>GitHub forked it and now has access to the main repo and has committed to maintaining it. So it's

00:21:54 <v Michael Kennedy>back. Also rough analyzed graph. It is fully independent of TAC. And they actually looked

00:21:58 <v Michael Kennedy>into using that as an alternative once it became unmaintained. But yeah, anyway, that's

00:22:04 <v Michael Kennedy>TAC is back. TAC is back. TAC is back. Also quick shout out to Doug Farrell and thanks. He wrote a

00:22:13 <v Michael Kennedy>Review my book and yeah, very nice. So I linked over to that if people are interested. Thank you, Doug for writing that

00:22:20 <v Michael Kennedy>TLDR says recommended so appreciate that. All right <v Michael Kennedy>Are we ready to joke about something? Yeah. Okay, so you've heard of

00:22:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Platform as a service PA <v Michael Kennedy>AS you've heard about infrastructure as a service IAS or IAAS DB as a service DB as

00:22:39 <v Michael Kennedy>A-A-S.

00:22:40 <v Michael Kennedy>Sometimes, though, your productivity just demands that you stay focused and you just say no.

00:22:46 <v Michael Kennedy>Right, Brian?

00:22:47 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:22:48 <v Michael Kennedy>So I present to you no as a service.

00:22:53 <v Michael Kennedy>So this is an API that will simply return a random but realistic excuse for saying no.

00:22:59 <v Michael Kennedy>So you can turn it down and stop.

00:23:01 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, nice.

00:23:02 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:23:03 <v Michael Kennedy>Built by humans, excuses, and humor.

00:23:05 <v Michael Kennedy>This project is sponsored by Git Ads.

00:23:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Git Ads.

00:23:08 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't know what that is.

00:23:09 <v Michael Kennedy>but anyway so if you pull it up it's um n-a-a-s i think it's n-o-a-s but you know whatever it's

00:23:16 <v Michael Kennedy>that's not the domain they got and you just get a little bit of json reason i'm finding an invisible

00:23:21 <v Michael Kennedy>dragon at home it's taking longer than expected or not my circus not my monkey so definitely not

00:23:26 <v Michael Kennedy>my act to perform cinderella left one shoe here and i need to help her find it instead of going out

00:23:31 <v Michael Kennedy>I would come, but I'm trying this new thing where I just don't.

00:23:38 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you need to integrate no for whatever reason into your application,

00:23:43 <v Michael Kennedy>well, here's the API right here.

00:23:44 <v Michael Kennedy>You get a JSON response.

00:23:45 <v Brian Okken>It is built as an API.

00:23:47 <v Brian Okken>This is great.

00:23:48 <v Brian Okken>You can just query it.

00:23:50 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, we're going to get probably an MCP built over as well.

00:23:52 <v Michael Kennedy>So you can integrate into your AI workflow as well.

00:23:55 <v Michael Kennedy>I mean, it's going to be powerful.

00:23:58 <v Brian Okken>Why use a constant when you can call an API?

00:24:01 <v Michael Kennedy>guy exactly anyway I thought no as a service is a pretty good joke I I love this last one I would

00:24:07 <v Brian Okken>come but I'm trying this new thing where I just don't exactly I my favorite is I can't make it

00:24:14 <v Michael Kennedy>because I don't want to exactly no don't want to all right well uh fun episode as always thank

00:24:23 <v Michael Kennedy>you everyone for listening thanks thanks Brian thank you thanks all yeah bye
