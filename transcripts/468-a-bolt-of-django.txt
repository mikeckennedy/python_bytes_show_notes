00:00:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:06 <v Michael Kennedy>This is episode 468, recorded February 2nd, 2026.

00:00:11 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:12 <v Michael Kennedy>And I'm Brian Ecken.

00:00:13 <v Michael Kennedy>This episode is brought to you by us.

00:00:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Brian's books, his new Lean TDD book, which you can get right now and is in development, but almost done.

00:00:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Yes.

00:00:24 <v Michael Kennedy>He's going to be done this week, folks.

00:00:26 <v Michael Kennedy>Don't worry about it.

00:00:28 <v Michael Kennedy>My Python and production book has been going strong as well.

00:00:30 <v Michael Kennedy>That's really fun one.

00:00:31 <v Michael Kennedy>And of course, our courses, all the links for those things are in the show notes.

00:00:35 <v Michael Kennedy>Follow us on the socials, sign up for the newsletter.

00:00:38 <v Michael Kennedy>We don't spam you.

00:00:39 <v Michael Kennedy>We just send you updates about the, about the episodes, extra information,

00:00:44 <v Michael Kennedy>more links, that kind of thing, as well as a periodic announcement of like, Hey,

00:00:48 <v Michael Kennedy>we've got a new course or a new book or whatever it is we're up to, you know,

00:00:51 <v Michael Kennedy>things like that, but we don't give it away.

00:00:53 <v Michael Kennedy>We don't sell it.

00:00:54 <v Michael Kennedy>Things like that.

00:00:55 <v Michael Kennedy>And with that, like a bolt of lightning striking out of the blue, what do we got?

00:01:01 <v Brian Okken>Well, we've got Django Bolt.

00:01:04 <v Brian Okken>So Django Bolt is actually, I learned about Django Bolt because I was looking at the Django

00:01:12 <v Brian Okken>chat website and or the Django chat and they had a, they had an episode building a Django

00:01:18 <v Brian Okken>API framework faster than FastAPI, which of course I was interested in.

00:01:24 <v Brian Okken>And so this episode actually discusses Django Bolt.

00:01:29 <v Brian Okken>And Django Bolt is a Rust powered behind the scenes, <v Brian Okken>but it's inspired.

00:01:36 <v Brian Okken>It's a, so it's like fast, <v Brian Okken>like we already have Django Rust framework

00:01:40 <v Brian Okken>and there's Django Ninja, <v Brian Okken>but this is along those lines of trying to get

00:01:46 <v Brian Okken>an API framework for Django.

00:01:49 <v Brian Okken>The inspiration is kind of interesting.

00:01:51 <v Brian Okken>I think down near the bottom.

00:01:54 <v Brian Okken>There's inspired by, oh, inspired by Django REST framework,

00:01:58 <v Brian Okken>FastAPI, Litestar, and Robin.

00:02:00 <v Brian Okken>Apparently some of the Rust Python, <v Brian Okken>the integrating Rust and Python

00:02:08 <v Brian Okken>was inspired by some of the Robin project.

00:02:10 <v Brian Okken>I don't know anything about Robin, actually.

00:02:12 <v Brian Okken>So interesting, different take on APIs for Django.

00:02:19 <v Brian Okken>And one of the things that was really interesting, especially in the discussion on the podcast, was the timing of it, trying to figure out how fast things are.

00:02:30 <v Brian Okken>And there's issues with that.

00:02:33 <v Brian Okken>But apparently he used a ton of graphs, a ton of charts, so you can look at what's going on.

00:02:39 <v Brian Okken>Also, in the act of doing that, realize that even Django REST framework, if you configure things in a certain way, you can do off-the-shelf things.

00:02:49 <v Brian Okken>things and get it pretty fast anyway.

00:02:52 <v Brian Okken>But so this is an interesting take.

00:02:55 <v Brian Okken>So there's a bunch of leaks we're going to link to.

00:02:57 <v Brian Okken>There's the Django Bolt repository.

00:03:00 <v Brian Okken>The documentation is set up and it's pretty good.

00:03:03 <v Brian Okken>Oh, I should back up.

00:03:05 <v Brian Okken>There's a little warning in it that it's still in progress.

00:03:10 <v Brian Okken>It's under active development.

00:03:12 <v Brian Okken>So be aware of that.

00:03:13 <v Brian Okken>OK, then there's the podcast episode.

00:03:16 <v Brian Okken>And then just recently, somebody came out with a video walking through using Django Bolt, which is an interesting discussion.

00:03:28 <v Brian Okken>And I actually just watched the first part of it.

00:03:31 <v Brian Okken>The first part of it actually talks about some of the ecosystem around APIs in Django and then walking through a little bit of it.

00:03:38 <v Brian Okken>So pretty interesting take on APIs.

00:03:42 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that is super interesting.

00:03:44 <v Michael Kennedy>I've been looking at Django Bolt as well.

00:03:46 <v Michael Kennedy>it's not because I plan to use it because my websites are not in Django but just it's got

00:03:50 <v Michael Kennedy>some really interesting ideas out there and yeah also note on the performance thing do your own

00:03:56 <v Michael Kennedy>performance testing put stuff I think it's more the more importantly people should think about this

00:04:01 <v Michael Kennedy>as side by side like three or four weeks ago when I did my Python numbers everyone should know

00:04:07 <v Michael Kennedy>every Python developer should know people said well you did this on a m4 pro cpu and it's not

00:04:13 <v Michael Kennedy>going to be the same when you run it on a five dollar crappy server in the cloud i'm like true

00:04:18 <v Michael Kennedy>but if i run it on a five dollar server the people go well it doesn't run that's not comparable to my

00:04:22 <v Michael Kennedy>high-end server or whatever right like it's more like okay this one is relative to that this is

00:04:27 <v Michael Kennedy>like 2x of that other one or something right so just keep that in mind right yeah i mean numbers

00:04:32 <v Brian Okken>are tested on right but also i mean as long as the numbers are relatively tested you're doing

00:04:39 <v Brian Okken>you're doing a and b on the same hardware now there there might be differences in the um the

00:04:46 <v Brian Okken>the behind the c the c python implementation based on different hardware and to the point where one

00:04:53 <v Brian Okken>technique will work better on some platform than another but i don't think a lot of people are

00:04:58 <v Michael Kennedy>thinking in the dirt that much but anyway yeah yeah uh one quick bit of real-time follow-up from

00:05:05 <v Michael Kennedy>and posts in the audience.

00:05:06 <v Michael Kennedy>My first job was in Django.

00:05:07 <v Michael Kennedy>I always loved Django ORM plus migrations framework <v Michael Kennedy>and Django Bolt connects ORM with fast async stuff,

00:05:13 <v Michael Kennedy>which is really cool indeed.

00:05:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it seems like a neat project.

00:05:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it'll be something to watch.

00:05:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Indeed, but did he mention async?

00:05:21 <v Michael Kennedy>What if you had leaks in your async code?

00:05:25 <v Michael Kennedy>So I want to talk about this thing called PyLeak.

00:05:28 <v Michael Kennedy>So PyLeak detects leaked async tasks, threads, <v Michael Kennedy>event loop blocking. So that's not exactly a leak, but it's kind of a leak. So it's non-async code

00:05:41 <v Michael Kennedy>leaking into async sections. When I first saw this, I thought it was a memory diagnosing thing,

00:05:46 <v Michael Kennedy>but what it's for is diagnosing async tasks that if you've ever seen like this, this task was not

00:05:52 <v Brian Okken>awaited or something like that. And it's got a really nice programming model, but this is,

00:05:59 <v Michael Kennedy>This is something that certainly can happen.

00:06:01 <v Michael Kennedy>I will tell you if you run the ty or the Pyrefly typing integration with your editor and maybe

00:06:09 <v Michael Kennedy>PyCharm, I don't think PyCharm does this, but those two will put, PyCharm will detect

00:06:14 <v Michael Kennedy>that the stuff is not being treated right, but the others do inline type overlays.

00:06:19 <v Michael Kennedy>So you'll have like x equals some function call and you think x is an integer.

00:06:24 <v Michael Kennedy>If it says x and then in little gray, like it's not really in the code, but it's putting

00:06:28 <v Michael Kennedy>colon, coroutine of something, something int.

00:06:32 <v Michael Kennedy>You're like, oh, I forgot to await that.

00:06:34 <v Michael Kennedy>Because this is coming back as the unexecuted coroutine,

00:06:38 <v Michael Kennedy>not the number, the integer, right?

00:06:41 <v Michael Kennedy>That it's easy to do if you're writing regular async code,

00:06:44 <v Michael Kennedy>but it's really easy to do if what you're doing <v Michael Kennedy>is converting a synchronous program to an async program.

00:06:50 <v Michael Kennedy>Because every call site of every function is synchronous,

00:06:54 <v Michael Kennedy>and then you go make those functions asynchronous, <v Michael Kennedy>and then you try to go back and fix them

00:06:58 <v Michael Kennedy>everywhere you called them.

00:06:59 <v Michael Kennedy>It's not a syntax or a runtime error, usually, <v Michael Kennedy>a lot of times, to actually not call that.

00:07:05 <v Michael Kennedy>It'll just run.

00:07:06 <v Michael Kennedy>So for example, if you have x, <v Michael Kennedy>let's say x equals some function call.

00:07:11 <v Michael Kennedy>It normally gives you back a number, <v Michael Kennedy>you wanna make sure it's not zero.

00:07:13 <v Michael Kennedy>So you'd say if x, if not x or if x, <v Michael Kennedy>something like that, right?

00:07:17 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, when it's a coroutine, your if x still runs, <v Michael Kennedy>it's just always true.

00:07:22 <v Michael Kennedy>And things like that, right?

00:07:23 <v Michael Kennedy>- Oh, yeah. - It's 'cause it's, <v Michael Kennedy>is the coroutine falsy?

00:07:25 <v Michael Kennedy>No, there's only like five or six things <v Michael Kennedy>and Python that are falsing and coroutine is not.

00:07:29 <v Michael Kennedy>So it's true, keep going.

00:07:31 <v Michael Kennedy>It's really sketch.

00:07:32 <v Michael Kennedy>So those are super hard to catch.

00:07:34 <v Michael Kennedy>And this is the kind of thing <v Michael Kennedy>that theoretically will catch it.

00:07:37 <v Michael Kennedy>So pretty neat.

00:07:38 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, it depends how you start it, I believe.

00:07:42 <v Michael Kennedy>You've gotta do like a create task <v Michael Kennedy>where the task has to be running.

00:07:44 <v Michael Kennedy>If you just create a coroutine <v Michael Kennedy>and don't do anything with it,

00:07:47 <v Michael Kennedy>it probably still won't catch it, just to be clear.

00:07:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, so here's how it works.

00:07:50 <v Michael Kennedy>You can say, create a context manager <v Michael Kennedy>with block and async with block,

00:07:55 <v Michael Kennedy>you say with no task links leaks and you run some code and here's a function call to create a task

00:08:03 <v Michael Kennedy>that is never awaited you wait long enough for that to come into existence and you're going to

00:08:06 <v Michael Kennedy>get an error right or this also works for threads just create a thread and never wait for it to stop

00:08:13 <v Michael Kennedy>so the context here is within this block of code i might be starting threads but they should all be

00:08:18 <v Michael Kennedy>done by the time we leave you know so this is pretty interesting and then another one is that's

00:08:23 <v Michael Kennedy>common is you can do things that have async counterparts, but the older way to do them

00:08:30 <v Michael Kennedy>would block the asyncio thread.

00:08:32 <v Michael Kennedy>And that's really bad because you want to spend as little time blocking that as possible

00:08:37 <v Michael Kennedy>because there's only one thread that does all the async work.

00:08:40 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you're doing FastAPI or whatever, one thread, don't block it, depending on how you

00:08:44 <v Michael Kennedy>set up your server, but generally.

00:08:45 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you had old code that said like time.sleep and then you convert that to async, this should

00:08:51 <v Michael Kennedy>be an await async io.sleep so that the it just lets the loop go for half a second rather than

00:08:58 <v Michael Kennedy>block the entire program so you can say with no event loop blocking right so those are the three

00:09:03 <v Michael Kennedy>types of tests so you can do it with context managers which is pretty cool you can also do it

00:09:08 <v Michael Kennedy>with decorators put them on a function no thread leaks no task leaks and so on and yeah you get

00:09:14 <v Michael Kennedy>errors like leaked task 2 or whatever right pretty descriptive shows you where it's called and so on

00:09:20 <v Michael Kennedy>Another one, though, you'll probably like this, Brian.

00:09:22 <v Michael Kennedy>A bunch of examples.

00:09:25 <v Michael Kennedy>But where are you?

00:09:26 <v Michael Kennedy>They also have a pytest plugin for it.

00:09:30 <v Michael Kennedy>So you can come and say pytest mark async.io <v Michael Kennedy>and then run with no event loop blocking in there,

00:09:38 <v Michael Kennedy>which is pretty nice.

00:09:40 <v Michael Kennedy>It's maybe not exactly what I was looking for, is it?

00:09:42 <v Michael Kennedy>There we go.

00:09:42 <v Michael Kennedy>No, the pytest plugin.

00:09:43 <v Michael Kennedy>So then you can set it up as a marker with no leaks <v Michael Kennedy>and things like that.

00:09:47 <v Michael Kennedy>Cool.

00:09:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:09:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:09:48 <v Michael Kennedy>No leaks.

00:09:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, yeah, if you're doing anything with async programming,

00:09:52 <v Michael Kennedy>might be worth throwing this on just to see what's going on.

00:09:55 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't think I would leave this on all the time.

00:09:57 <v Michael Kennedy>But having the unit test for it, good.

00:10:00 <v Michael Kennedy>And maybe if you're doing conversions, like I said, <v Michael Kennedy>it's especially error prone to go from converting synchronous code to asynchronous code

00:10:06 <v Michael Kennedy>because it's so easy to overlook converting one bit here or there.

00:10:09 <v Michael Kennedy>So this would ideally catch it.

00:10:11 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:10:12 <v Brian Okken>It'd be one of those things of like also timing it.

00:10:16 <v Brian Okken>during development if you had this on to make sure things are like cool in your synchronous part or

00:10:23 <v Brian Okken>async part um and then you know how much slower is it or how much faster is it if you take that out

00:10:29 <v Brian Okken>if there's not much of a difference um yeah maybe leave it yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly but well

00:10:36 <v Brian Okken>yeah more django yeah i've actually been thinking about django a lot lately so i've got a a few

00:10:43 <v Brian Okken>articles. I just want to kind of run through a few of them that I ran across. I don't have much to

00:10:48 <v Brian Okken>say about either one of them, so I thought I'd combine them into one topic. So first off, we have

00:10:53 <v Brian Okken>from Paul Taylor, migrating from Celery to Django Tasks. And I know Django Tasks, I can't remember

00:11:00 <v Brian Okken>if it was just in this recent release. I think so. But they're a newish thing. So you might have

00:11:06 <v Brian Okken>some code around that you're a project that's using Celery already, and you want to use Django

00:11:11 <v Brian Okken>tasks instead so um walking through some of the some of the differences um and uh and and what to

00:11:18 <v Brian Okken>watch out for the different settings um and i did it made me want to play with it a little bit because

00:11:23 <v Brian Okken>um apparently django tasks has uh well if you combine it with cron task you can have tasks run

00:11:29 <v Brian Okken>with at certain intervals which is kind of fun that's neat you probably can do that with celery

00:11:35 <v Michael Kennedy>too but yeah but how many servers do you want this is like if your web app is running this

00:11:41 <v Michael Kennedy>happening versus are the servers talking to each other?

00:11:45 <v Brian Okken>Then next article, this is from Julia Evans, <v Brian Okken>and she brought us all those cool zines

00:11:54 <v Brian Okken>about programming in GitHub and all that stuff.

00:11:58 <v Brian Okken>She wrote some notes on starting to use Django.

00:12:01 <v Brian Okken>One of the things I just like about this is she's <v Brian Okken>experienced developers,

00:12:06 <v Brian Okken>you probably are already familiar with Julia Evans.

00:12:09 <v Brian Okken>But one of her comments about Django is it's less magic than Rails.

00:12:14 <v Brian Okken>And one of the things about that isn't just a style thing.

00:12:18 <v Brian Okken>It's when you leave a project and come back a few months later, can you find, can you pick it up and understand where things are?

00:12:26 <v Brian Okken>And just her commentary is just Django makes it more obvious.

00:12:30 <v Brian Okken>If you want to look for your views, they're in views.py, things like that.

00:12:35 <v Brian Okken>The built-in admin, of course, is nice.

00:12:38 <v Brian Okken>And the ORM, everybody loves the ORM.

00:12:41 <v Brian Okken>Or if you like the ORM, you love it, probably.

00:12:46 <v Brian Okken>Automatic migrations, that's a really cool built-in thing of Django.

00:12:53 <v Brian Okken>Good docs.

00:12:55 <v Brian Okken>And this is like the third one.

00:12:57 <v Brian Okken>Oh, built-in email was as neat.

00:12:59 <v Brian Okken>I haven't tried to use email with Django, but it's on my to-do list.

00:13:03 <v Brian Okken>Apparently, it's not that difficult.

00:13:04 <v Brian Okken>So that's cool.

00:13:07 <v Brian Okken>one of the things is that she's said that she's been using SQLite for Django in production and

00:13:14 <v Brian Okken>followed these instructions. And these instructions is the last article I want to talk about, which is

00:13:21 <v Brian Okken>the definitive guide to using Django with SQLite in production. And I just skimmed this, but

00:13:28 <v Brian Okken>it goes through how to set up databases and cache and all that stuff. I'm going to drop down to the

00:13:35 <v Brian Okken>conclusion there's quite a bit here and but the conclusion says um that is reduced complexity

00:13:42 <v Brian Okken>um it still looks kind of complex to convert to me but um but maybe it's less complex than

00:13:48 <v Brian Okken>keeping a sqlite or a postgres database around or something so yeah maybe backup is copy the file

00:13:55 <v Brian Okken>that's nice yeah so um anyway um and i can't remember which article was in there was a

00:14:00 <v Brian Okken>discussion around having in one of these Django articles about having tasks be stored in the

00:14:09 <v Brian Okken>database itself, which is interesting. I didn't know you could do that. So yeah, fun with Django.

00:14:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, very cool. I mean, in a sense, we're using SQLite in production. Python Bytes has a bunch of

00:14:20 <v Michael Kennedy>caching through disk cache, and disk cache is really just a fancy front end to SQLite. So

00:14:30 <v Michael Kennedy>So I want to talk about Datastar. So Datastar is a cool framework. This is not quite the exact right

00:14:39 <v Michael Kennedy>mental model for thinking about it, but it's kind of the spiritual successor to HTMX, I think.

00:14:45 <v Michael Kennedy>So the folks behind Datastar, they came from being contributors to the HTMX side and being

00:14:53 <v Michael Kennedy>big fans of it. So for those of you who don't know, HTMX, super cool library,

00:14:57 <v Michael Kennedy>it kind of extends the HTML markup to do more things.

00:15:01 <v Michael Kennedy>So instead of just saying, here's a button, <v Michael Kennedy>you could say, here's a button,

00:15:06 <v Michael Kennedy>and on click, I want you to call this thing on the server.

00:15:09 <v Michael Kennedy>And when it comes back, I want you to replace this part of the page

00:15:12 <v Michael Kennedy>with what came back from the server and so on.

00:15:14 <v Michael Kennedy>And HTMX is great, but HTMX only does that sort of local server communication, right?

00:15:21 <v Michael Kennedy>So it might update some section, <v Michael Kennedy>but what if when that part updates, another part of the page updates?

00:15:26 <v Michael Kennedy>and it gets a little bit more complicated.

00:15:29 <v Michael Kennedy>So what people have done is they paired HTMX with AlpineJS and other things,

00:15:34 <v Michael Kennedy>but AlpineJS has its sort of truth for what the data is,

00:15:38 <v Michael Kennedy>and then HTMX has the DOM and the server, <v Michael Kennedy>and it's a little bit your job to juggle the go-between for these libraries,

00:15:44 <v Michael Kennedy>which is not ideal.

00:15:45 <v Michael Kennedy>So Datastar takes this idea and says, <v Michael Kennedy>what if the server was the source of truth?

00:15:50 <v Michael Kennedy>What if we could have multiple parts of the page update

00:15:54 <v Michael Kennedy>in kind of a HTMX way.

00:15:56 <v Michael Kennedy>You say like, if you interact with this, <v Michael Kennedy>you know, like click on this element,

00:15:59 <v Michael Kennedy>I want you to get this stuff from the server.

00:16:00 <v Michael Kennedy>And it sends back the page.

00:16:02 <v Michael Kennedy>And very much like PyView, <v Michael Kennedy>which we talked about previously,

00:16:05 <v Michael Kennedy>it will take what comes back from the server, <v Michael Kennedy>diff it and figure out,

00:16:09 <v Michael Kennedy>well, this section with this ID <v Michael Kennedy>is going to be updated over here.

00:16:12 <v Michael Kennedy>And some other part is going to be updated with this <v Michael Kennedy>because that ID part

00:16:16 <v Michael Kennedy>in the thing that came back matches over there.

00:16:18 <v Michael Kennedy>And it's got this really nice way <v Michael Kennedy>to sort of be a little more holistic,

00:16:21 <v Michael Kennedy>but still do HTMX-like attributes with server-sent event things going on.

00:16:27 <v Michael Kennedy>So in a way, it's like PyView.

00:16:29 <v Michael Kennedy>But what's really different about this, two things.

00:16:31 <v Michael Kennedy>First is it's not a web framework.

00:16:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Like PyView is a web framework.

00:16:35 <v Michael Kennedy>Like Django is a web framework.

00:16:36 <v Michael Kennedy>Like Flask is a web framework.

00:16:38 <v Michael Kennedy>This is purely a JavaScript library that talks to the server

00:16:42 <v Michael Kennedy>and basically handles everything on the front end.

00:16:44 <v Michael Kennedy>It's only 11K too, by the way.

00:16:46 <v Michael Kennedy>So it's incredibly small.

00:16:47 <v Michael Kennedy>And it does what AlpineJS does.

00:16:49 <v Michael Kennedy>It has sort of a data binding thing.

00:16:51 <v Michael Kennedy>and the server can say, <v Michael Kennedy>I know you have a variable called username.

00:16:56 <v Michael Kennedy>And if I update username on the server, <v Michael Kennedy>it will automatically change the page

00:17:00 <v Michael Kennedy>everywhere username is used.

00:17:02 <v Michael Kennedy>So it has these things called signals as well.

00:17:05 <v Michael Kennedy>Pretty neat library, like this star field here.

00:17:06 <v Michael Kennedy>See how if you go to the website, <v Michael Kennedy>it's following my mouse around.

00:17:10 <v Michael Kennedy>You can make it go faster or slower.

00:17:12 <v Michael Kennedy>It feels like you're in Star Wars, <v Michael Kennedy>which is pretty cool.

00:17:15 <v Michael Kennedy>But all of that is being driven <v Michael Kennedy>by server set events off of the server,

00:17:19 <v Michael Kennedy>which is pretty neat.

00:17:20 <v Michael Kennedy>There's a bunch of cool examples.

00:17:22 <v Michael Kennedy>So you can go to the examples page if I zoom back a bit.

00:17:26 <v Michael Kennedy>They also have this really fun video.

00:17:27 <v Michael Kennedy>So you should definitely watch the video.

00:17:29 <v Michael Kennedy>But let me show you an example.

00:17:31 <v Michael Kennedy>So there's a bunch of these examples.

00:17:34 <v Michael Kennedy>And if I open up two of these and put them side by side,

00:17:37 <v Michael Kennedy>I can use the new Vivaldi thing or I can tile them together.

00:17:41 <v Michael Kennedy>And if I get them to zoom the same size.

00:17:44 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you come over here, you can just type in.

00:17:47 <v Michael Kennedy>If you put these two side by side, you can say record.

00:17:50 <v Michael Kennedy>podcast and boom they're both going i don't know this one is going to finish that one i'm going to

00:17:55 <v Michael Kennedy>finish that let's uh show only the completed ones oh wow and that's cool it happens to be on my

00:18:00 <v Michael Kennedy>same machine but really they could be anywhere there's a really bunch of a bunch of interesting

00:18:05 <v Michael Kennedy>performance things around with data star so you kind of like htmx be like ah but it's a little

00:18:12 <v Michael Kennedy>bit not quite enough for what i need to do check this out it's a really cool thing and this episode

00:18:17 <v Michael Kennedy>with the Datastar team is coming out on Talk Python this week.

00:18:20 <v Michael Kennedy>I wanted to feature Datastar on the show sooner, <v Michael Kennedy>but then when I knew I was going to have them on Talk Python,

00:18:27 <v Michael Kennedy>I was like, let me just wait until I get that episode recorded.

00:18:29 <v Michael Kennedy>People who are more interested can listen to that as well.

00:18:32 <v Michael Kennedy>So that's coming out.

00:18:34 <v Brian Okken>Plus a couple bonuses on this, <v Brian Okken>that it won the website,

00:18:40 <v Brian Okken>just the retro look of it looks awesome.

00:18:43 <v Brian Okken>It's great, isn't it?

00:18:44 <v Brian Okken>And that they use the term hypermedia.

00:18:48 <v Brian Okken>Kind of love that back to the origins.

00:18:52 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, yeah, for sure.

00:18:53 <v Michael Kennedy>And there's also this really nice article by Chris May,

00:18:58 <v Michael Kennedy>who is a very big fan of HTMX, <v Michael Kennedy>gave some Django FlaskCon talk on it,

00:19:05 <v Michael Kennedy>and basically went through and said, <v Michael Kennedy>why do I think I'm using Datastar these days?

00:19:09 <v Michael Kennedy>So really nice example, but got some Python examples.

00:19:13 <v Michael Kennedy>There's a Python SDK that you can bring in.

00:19:16 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you were using Flask, use the SDK.

00:19:19 <v Michael Kennedy>If you're using FastAPI, use the SDK or whatever.

00:19:21 <v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, super neat.

00:19:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay, cool.

00:19:24 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:19:25 <v Michael Kennedy>That's it for all of our topics, isn't it?

00:19:27 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:19:28 <v Michael Kennedy>Got anything out there you want to cover?

00:19:30 <v Michael Kennedy>Any extras?

00:19:32 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:19:32 <v Brian Okken>So yeah, a couple of extras.

00:19:35 <v Brian Okken>Let's see.

00:19:35 <v Brian Okken>I'm all zoomed out.

00:19:36 <v Brian Okken>So I did bring up Django chat before I, the, the, <v Brian Okken>I was lucky enough to be asked to be on the show as well.

00:19:44 <v Brian Okken>So I was talking about lean TDD and a lot of other stuff on the,

00:19:49 <v Brian Okken>the Django chat podcast. I, you know, <v Brian Okken>one of the things they asked me is, is the, is about the, what,

00:19:56 <v Brian Okken>the trends in web frameworks for Python. And I'm like, man,

00:20:00 <v Brian Okken>I'm the wrong guy to ask about that. Yeah, sure. Okay.

00:20:04 <v Michael Kennedy>You mean the ones that run on the hardware that control the Wi-Fi signals?

00:20:08 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:20:10 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, so I am working a little bit at Django lately, <v Brian Okken>but I'm by no means a Django expert.

00:20:17 <v Brian Okken>But we did get into the Lean TDD and inverting the testing pyramid a little bit.

00:20:23 <v Brian Okken>One of the things I love about this and was really fun because Carlton,

00:20:27 <v Brian Okken>when I brought up the fact, brought up some reasons to shy away from unit tests as much.

00:20:34 <v Brian Okken>Carlton kind of got his feathers ruffled, <v Brian Okken>and we walked through some of the good aspects of unit tests

00:20:42 <v Brian Okken>and where you might want to keep them, where you might want to ditch them.

00:20:44 <v Brian Okken>So that was fun.

00:20:47 <v Brian Okken>The next extra is that I did notice that the PEP 686, <v Brian Okken>making UTF-8 mode the default, is now, or maybe it was.

00:20:59 <v Brian Okken>Maybe it was a while ago.

00:21:01 <v Brian Okken>But anyway, I just noticed that it was finals.

00:21:03 <v Brian Okken>If we haven't covered it already, it's finalized in 3.15.

00:21:07 <v Brian Okken>It'll be there.

00:21:07 <v Brian Okken>So that's good.

00:21:09 <v Brian Okken>I think that's interesting.

00:21:10 <v Michael Kennedy>This is a really old request, but it didn't get until next year, right?

00:21:14 <v Michael Kennedy>3.15.

00:21:15 <v Michael Kennedy>So this was originally started in 2022.

00:21:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:21:19 <v Michael Kennedy>But it's not yet in Python, right?

00:21:22 <v Michael Kennedy>It's 3.15, as you point out.

00:21:25 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I'm looking forward to having the default be just UTF-8.

00:21:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I mean, if you're going to have a default.

00:21:32 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's pick the one that is mostly used and supports all the different languages and emojis.

00:21:38 <v Michael Kennedy>It's important to have emojis.

00:21:39 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:21:40 <v Brian Okken>Before we move on, I do have, I guess, a way side tangent topic.

00:21:47 <v Brian Okken>Kind of the sci-fi-ness of Datastar reminded me that recently I remembered the cheesy 80s movie

00:21:54 <v Brian Okken>that reminded me of Tesla's Cybertrucks.

00:21:58 <v Brian Okken>And the cheesy movie was called Megaforce.

00:22:01 <v Brian Okken>And it's from 81.

00:22:02 <v Brian Okken>did you ever see Megaforce?

00:22:04 <v Brian Okken>I have somehow missed this cultural phenomenon.

00:22:06 <v Brian Okken>Well, you're probably well off <v Brian Okken>because Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 6%.

00:22:13 <v Brian Okken>And the reason why I think about it <v Brian Okken>when I see Teslas is because of these trucks.

00:22:17 <v Brian Okken>So these tanks in there, in the Megaforce, <v Brian Okken>kind of remind me of, well,

00:22:22 <v Brian Okken>just sort of the angles and stuff <v Brian Okken>kind of remind me of Cyber.

00:22:25 <v Brian Okken>They do have that, don't they?

00:22:27 <v Brian Okken>Incredible.

00:22:28 <v Brian Okken>Those are my extras.

00:22:29 <v Brian Okken>I love you, but you're hopeless.

00:22:31 <v Brian Okken>On Blu-ray.

00:22:34 <v Michael Kennedy>wow that's is that a song i love anyway i don't know it seems like it comes from the movie but i

00:22:39 <v Michael Kennedy>don't know look at the shots oh my gosh even the clothes are it's so bad cyber truck looking

00:22:46 <v Brian Okken>i want one of these though uh but yeah so do you have any extras i uh this has completely

00:22:53 <v Michael Kennedy>escaped me this is incredible yes i have extras so first of all brayson daniel has been on the show

00:22:59 <v Michael Kennedy>a long time ago when we were having guests, wrote an article about whether, well, wrote a pro, has a

00:23:06 <v Michael Kennedy>project and a theory about whether LLMs think or if they're just pure statistics. And as a good data

00:23:13 <v Michael Kennedy>scientist, created this project here. Yes. And it's a literature review about whether machines think

00:23:22 <v Michael Kennedy>or don't think. And so now he's got an LLM analyzing whether all the papers on whether LLMs

00:23:28 <v Michael Kennedy>think or don't think. And you can say, so the premise is that they do not, right? So there's

00:23:34 <v Michael Kennedy>97 papers that support it, but 13 that challenge it. And if you go and look at them, you can actually

00:23:39 <v Michael Kennedy>hover over these. And it's just a beautiful website. So one, I think it's an interesting,

00:23:44 <v Michael Kennedy>timely topic, but two, it's just a really neat way to present information. Yeah. Yeah. So well done,

00:23:50 <v Michael Kennedy>Grayson. Also came across a new Mastodon app called IceCubes, and it's free and open source.

00:23:57 <v Michael Kennedy>if you're a Mac person at least.

00:23:59 <v Michael Kennedy>So I don't know, I've been playing with this.

00:24:01 <v Michael Kennedy>It looks nice.

00:24:02 <v Michael Kennedy>I really like it.

00:24:03 <v Michael Kennedy>And having it open source, you know, we just, <v Michael Kennedy>I don't know how you feel about this, Brian,

00:24:07 <v Michael Kennedy>but I just don't usually connect open source in Mac apps,

00:24:12 <v Michael Kennedy>or sorry, iOS apps.

00:24:14 <v Michael Kennedy>This is on both, but really I don't think, <v Michael Kennedy>like phone apps and open source,

00:24:18 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't think about those being, <v Michael Kennedy>I know there are some out there,

00:24:21 <v Michael Kennedy>but it's way less common.

00:24:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, anyway, I just want to give it a shout out.

00:24:24 <v Michael Kennedy>I thought it was cool.

00:24:25 <v Michael Kennedy>I ran across it looking into something else.

00:24:27 <v Brian Okken>- Yeah, don't you have to like pay to be like, <v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, I pay a hundred dollars a year.

00:24:32 <v Michael Kennedy>So I get the privilege to publish to Apple.

00:24:35 <v Michael Kennedy>So I pay a hundred dollars a year for the privilege <v Michael Kennedy>to make Apple's products more valuable to them.

00:24:41 <v Michael Kennedy>It's amazing.

00:24:42 <v Brian Okken>- Yeah, I was just thinking that that might be <v Brian Okken>one of the reasons why we don't see a lot of open source

00:24:46 <v Brian Okken>because you.

00:24:47 <v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, exactly.

00:24:47 <v Michael Kennedy>And then whose job is it to be in charge of it?

00:24:50 <v Michael Kennedy>'Cause it's not as easy to release <v Michael Kennedy>'cause it's gotta go through somebody's account.

00:24:54 <v Michael Kennedy>And I don't know, it's just, it's just not that common.

00:24:56 <v Michael Kennedy>And I ran across this and I thought it was really cool.

00:24:58 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'm using this for my Mastodoning.

00:25:00 <v Michael Kennedy>However, Mona, the one I was using before, <v Michael Kennedy>has a really nice feature that if you write a thread too long,

00:25:05 <v Michael Kennedy>it'll split it into a series, like one of two, two of three,

00:25:08 <v Michael Kennedy>two, one of three, two of three, three of three automatically.

00:25:11 <v Michael Kennedy>And this one doesn't have that, but we could open a PR.

00:25:14 <v Michael Kennedy>How's that?

00:25:14 <v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah.

00:25:15 <v Michael Kennedy>- All right, carrying on.

00:25:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Remember we talked about Rundl, R-U-M-D-L, <v Michael Kennedy>which is a Rust-based markdown formatter and linter.

00:25:23 <v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah.

00:25:24 <v Michael Kennedy>- Which is really nice.

00:25:25 <v Michael Kennedy>using it for various things.

00:25:27 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, there's now a Rumdoll IntelliJ plugin.

00:25:31 <v Michael Kennedy>So most of the people listening will care about that <v Michael Kennedy>in terms of PyCharm.

00:25:36 <v Michael Kennedy>But if you want to have that built right into your editor

00:25:39 <v Michael Kennedy>and you're using PyCharm, you can install the plugin <v Michael Kennedy>and off it goes.

00:25:43 <v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah.

00:25:43 <v Michael Kennedy>- Okay, and then really quickly, <v Michael Kennedy>the last time I talked about how curl,

00:25:48 <v Michael Kennedy>like you mentioned something about AI frustration <v Michael Kennedy>with some project or whatever.

00:25:54 <v Michael Kennedy>And I pointed out curl.

00:25:56 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'm linking to Ars Technica article that says overrun by AI slop curl scraps bug bounties to ensure that they keep their mental health intact.

00:26:08 <v Michael Kennedy>So there was the PRs, the PRs that were like thousands of lines long and they were just kind of really messy.

00:26:15 <v Michael Kennedy>And people are like, we're not accepting that.

00:26:17 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't remember what project that was.

00:26:19 <v Michael Kennedy>It's been a long time.

00:26:19 <v Michael Kennedy>It's been a week.

00:26:20 <v Michael Kennedy>But I said that curl's doing the same thing.

00:26:22 <v Michael Kennedy>It's not exactly the same thing.

00:26:23 <v Michael Kennedy>what they're doing is they had a bug bounty program like hey well we'll pay you a thousand

00:26:27 <v Michael Kennedy>dollars if you find a memory overflow or something like that well a bunch of people were just turning

00:26:32 <v Michael Kennedy>clod code or something loose on it say find all the bugs and then some you know then they were

00:26:35 <v Michael Kennedy>submitting whatever clod code told them and apparently a lot of times clod code got the

00:26:41 <v Michael Kennedy>understanding wrong so it wasn't really a bug security bug and so the person that was just like

00:26:46 <v Michael Kennedy>i can't i cannot answer more of these no that's not actually a problem here's why and the

00:26:53 <v Michael Kennedy>The incentives were misaligned, right?

00:26:55 <v Michael Kennedy>Like with a PR, like what is the incentive?

00:26:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Maybe like, oh, I'm a contributor.

00:26:59 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, this they were getting paid for.

00:27:01 <v Michael Kennedy>So they were getting overwhelmed.

00:27:03 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, link into that for all the people who care.

00:27:06 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:27:06 <v Michael Kennedy>And finally.

00:27:07 <v Brian Okken>I think Curl's one of those like maintained by one person apps.

00:27:11 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:27:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:27:12 <v Michael Kennedy>It's got, if not one, it's a very small team.

00:27:15 <v Michael Kennedy>Finally, the PSF JetBrains survey for 2026 is on.

00:27:21 <v Michael Kennedy>Have you done this yet?

00:27:22 <v Michael Kennedy>No.

00:27:23 <v Michael Kennedy>I have not either, but.

00:27:23 <v Michael Kennedy>- So that time of the year already.

00:27:25 <v Brian Okken>- I know, yeah.

00:27:26 <v Michael Kennedy>So anyway, it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to fill out,

00:27:29 <v Michael Kennedy>link into it.

00:27:30 <v Michael Kennedy>Everyone go out there, fill this out, <v Michael Kennedy>make your voice heard.

00:27:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Tell them, please tell them that CSS <v Michael Kennedy>is not a programming language.

00:27:36 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:27:36 <v Michael Kennedy>- And you all use Bytest.

00:27:38 <v Michael Kennedy>Do not click no testing.

00:27:41 <v Michael Kennedy>Do not test.

00:27:41 <v Michael Kennedy>- Exactly.

00:27:42 <v Michael Kennedy>The second most popular testing framework is none.

00:27:45 <v Brian Okken>- Yeah.

00:27:48 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, yeah.

00:27:49 <v Brian Okken>Which is great 'cause it used to be the number one.

00:27:52 <v Michael Kennedy>progress that's a form of progress all right ready for a joke yeah i don't remember what i picked for

00:27:57 <v Michael Kennedy>this so it's gonna be news to me as well this is fun okay uh no i don't care about that okay this

00:28:03 <v Michael Kennedy>is good so we've all heard of these license plates that have um crazy stuff has gone wrong like there

00:28:09 <v Michael Kennedy>was a license plate uh the person put null for their license plate and instead of because they

00:28:15 <v Michael Kennedy>thought that there would be a test like if not equal to null then send ticket or whatever yeah

00:28:19 <v Michael Kennedy>But instead it's like, if value equals null, <v Michael Kennedy>and they started getting all the tickets.

00:28:24 <v Michael Kennedy>So here's a car with a license plate that says example.

00:28:29 <v Michael Kennedy>And the title is when test values get pushed to production.

00:28:32 <v Michael Kennedy>What state is that?

00:28:34 <v Michael Kennedy>That's good.

00:28:35 <v Michael Kennedy>What state are we looking here?

00:28:37 <v Michael Kennedy>Maryland.

00:28:38 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, so if you're in Maryland, <v Michael Kennedy>there's an example car out there.

00:28:41 <v Brian Okken>You get slugged for that.

00:28:42 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:28:42 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's pretty fun.

00:28:44 <v Brian Okken>Do your kids do the yellow bug thing or the yellow car?

00:28:47 <v Brian Okken>Oh, yeah.

00:28:48 <v Michael Kennedy>yeah the punch bug sort of thing and well because when we were kids it was slug bug or punch bugs

00:28:53 <v Brian Okken>like but yeah yeah so my kids do if it's a yellow car um or if it's a license plate with the state

00:29:02 <v Brian Okken>that's not adjacent to your state um or your own state so like uh yeah for us washington wouldn't

00:29:09 <v Brian Okken>work but like montana would sort of thing um so i'm like that's just you're just randomly picking

00:29:16 <v Brian Okken>things so i chose um uh it's um any car that's uh what not black um or not a sedan uh which is you

00:29:26 <v Brian Okken>know actually no i chose black car and and not a sedan which now is most cars so yeah yeah you're

00:29:33 <v Michael Kennedy>gonna get tired from punching your kids my my kid does that as well and i feel like it's just an

00:29:38 <v Michael Kennedy>excuse to go around they don't hit you hard but you know just being so just taps because yeah yeah

00:29:43 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, so also we did this once like two blocks away from a Stanley Steamer, which they're all yellow trucks.

00:29:52 <v Brian Okken>And we were waiting in line somewhere where there was like, we didn't know why, but every like every five minutes, a Stanley Steamer truck was coming by.

00:29:59 <v Brian Okken>And we're like, this is ridiculous.

00:30:00 <v Michael Kennedy>But that's crazy.

00:30:02 <v Michael Kennedy>Before we wrap it up really quick, Christian, out the honest, gave us some interesting thoughts on the Apple on the iOS, not open source intersection.

00:30:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Apple apps must be only available through the Apple App Store,

00:30:16 <v Michael Kennedy>which is interesting, right?

00:30:18 <v Michael Kennedy>The ones that are for iOS, not for macOS.

00:30:20 <v Brian Okken>Oh, right.

00:30:21 <v Brian Okken>Even if you allow, yeah, weird.

00:30:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, so that makes it difficult.

00:30:25 <v Michael Kennedy>And says, GPL licensed software popular in a source <v Michael Kennedy>is often incompatible with App Store terms

00:30:30 <v Michael Kennedy>because Apple requires control over binaries <v Michael Kennedy>and does not distribute the source code.

00:30:34 <v Michael Kennedy>So, interesting.

00:30:35 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:30:36 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:30:37 <v Michael Kennedy>More to say on that in the not too distant future, actually.

00:30:41 <v Michael Kennedy>Do you have more apps coming now?

00:30:42 <v Michael Kennedy>I have stuff to share, but I can't share any more than that.

00:30:45 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:30:46 <v Michael Kennedy>Teaser.

00:30:47 <v Michael Kennedy>I've had a better experience this time.

00:30:49 <v Michael Kennedy>I'll just leave it at that.

00:30:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Don't touch that dial.

00:30:51 <v Michael Kennedy>Anytime you have to interact with these app stores, it's not the best.

00:30:55 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:30:56 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:30:56 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:30:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Don't touch that dial for now.

00:30:58 <v Michael Kennedy>Signing off though.

00:30:59 <v Michael Kennedy>See you later, Brian.

00:31:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Bye everyone.

00:31:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Bye.
