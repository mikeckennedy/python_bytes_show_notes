00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.880
This is episode 349, recorded August 21st, 2023.


00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.240
And I am Brian Okken.


00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.480
And I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.680
And we have a lot of exciting stuff to cover this week.


00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.680
But before we do, I'd like to thank our Patreon supporters and ourselves for keeping this thing going, even without sponsors.


00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.600
But if, if you or your company would like to sponsor, Python bites, just,


00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.640
um, talk to us.


00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.640
So anyway, Michael, do you want to kick us off with the first story?


00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.400
Let's kick it off.


00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.960
Let's kick it off with some open source.


00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.880
That's not exactly Python, but when I talked about this on Mastodon, you know


00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.360
what Mastodon hasn't even changed his name this week, that was pretty cool.


00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.440
I talked about a Mastodon.


00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.080
There seemed to be quite a bit of excitement and interest in this.


00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.520
So I figured, you know what, let's make this a topic for Python bites.


00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.720
Because there's two cool open source things.


00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.220
So surely you've heard of Instapaper.


00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.320
That's the OG, I want to read something later without ads, without distractions.


00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.220
You know, a lot of times it's not even ads.


00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.920
It's just like, wow, the fonts are so small on this website or the layout is so bad, you know?


00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.720
>> Yeah, I kind of forgot about Instapaper.


00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.320
But yeah.


00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.920
>> Yeah, Instapaper was the OG, right?


00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.420
>> Yeah.


00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.020
>> And then Pocket is probably the most well-known version of that.


00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.100
And, you know, pockets kind of cool was either I believe it was acquired by not created by


00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.280
Mozilla, but yeah supporting pocket kind of supports Mozilla which kind of supports Firefox, which is good, but Google mostly supports Firefox


00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.820
So there's that


00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.940
So pockets pretty good, but there's this new project on my well, let's say new to Michael and called omnivore


00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.300
It is the free open source read it later app for serious readers. Okay, okay


00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.100
So this thing is super, super nice.


00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.240
The integrations with, at least I've only tested it on iOS,


00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.600
but the integration with iOS are incredible.


00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.840
So it's really easy to go from something like Reader,


00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.880
right, Reader, which I've talked about before


00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.400
in the RSS world, but you know,


00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.220
you pick your RSS reader of choice,


00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.800
go through your articles, you hit share,


00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.720
and boom, it just goes straight into Omnivore,


00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.920
which is pretty cool.


00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.280
And then it has a really nice way to like categorize, tag,


00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.100
all that kind of stuff and then read it.


00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.540
So Brett Cannon, when I posted this, asked like,


00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.740
well, how do you find it compared to like Pocket


00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.580
and other stuff?


00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.580
Does it strip out too much, too many things?


00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.500
And it jumped in and said, oh, this is way better.


00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.460
It seems to err a little bit on the side


00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.900
and leaving potentially a little bit too much stuff in,


00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.300
but at the same time, not removing quotes


00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.700
or code sections or things like that.


00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.700
So really, really nice.


00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.660
It's distraction-free, privacy-focused, open source.


00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.260
You can even self-host it if you'd like.


00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.020
So for some reason you want,


00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.020
you're like, I'm gonna read stuff


00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.660
and I wanna make sure that it's completely private,


00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.380
then you can set it up and run it on your own.


00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.700
- Oh, that's pretty cool.


00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.540
- That's pretty cool, right?


00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.380
- Yeah.


00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.300
- And one other thing that's quite neat about it,


00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.180
let me kind of pull through here a bit.


00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.700
So one of the things you can do,


00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.860
I don't know if it even shows it,


00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.300
but it obviously syncs where you've read.


00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.580
So you can go down and like if you've read 23%


00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.920
into an article, like a long, you know,


00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.720
30 minute read time article,


00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.880
and you switch to another device or to the web,


00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.720
it'll say, you know, here's how far you are,


00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720
resume from there.


00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.920
The other thing it does is it has text to speech,


00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.560
which, you know, that's,


00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.880
it sounds like a robot's reading to you sometimes,


00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.840
but they have a, like a high end text to speech option


00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.960
where there's not very many voices to choose from,


00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.960
but it sounds almost like a person


00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.280
reading the articles to you.


00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.120
- Oh, wow.


00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.000
- And so that is, that's super nice,


00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.080
and it'll show you, you can have it like highlight the words


00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.920
as it's reading along.


00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.760
So if you got an article to read,


00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.680
but really also got the yard to mow,


00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.080
seriously, put it in the background and just go.


00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.120
It's actually super, super neat.


00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.680
And what else?


00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.040
I think that's probably it.


00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.240
There's, you can take highlights and stuff


00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.680
as you would expect, but it's really good for,


00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.320
when you've got to do a lot of research on a project,


00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.880
I think it's really good for us, honestly.


00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.200
We read a lot of articles and you want to take notes,


00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.600
highlight a section, add a note


00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.600
about why that's relevant and stuff.


00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.800
So when we go back to one of these long articles


00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.560
and we're like, hey, I want to tell Brian about it


00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.720
or vice versa, you're like, what was the part of this


00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.880
that actually started, here it is,


00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.720
you know, you just bump through it.


00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.680
So really, really neat.


00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.560
And then it said, you can also sync it with other stuff


00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.600
like your second brain things.


00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.840
I'm like, wait, what is it talking about?


00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.480
It says you can connect it to things like LogSec.


00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.960
LogSec is another open source thing


00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.880
that's kind of like Notion, but running locally,


00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.680
I think runs locally.


00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.160
Anyway, so here's something else that I discovered along the way that's also


00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.240
pretty excellent.


00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.680
So you can do like whiteboards with like YouTube videos that connect over to


00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.680
different parts and like these sort of, it's kind of funky, but I haven't used


00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.480
that much, but omnivore strong recommendation for this.


00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.720
People should definitely, definitely check it out.


00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.640
Oh, that's pretty cool.


00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.240
I would also, I was thinking about that text to speech thing.


00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.200
I would have loved that when I was in college and I had to read a bunch of


00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.560
junk and I'm on the bus or something.


00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.480
That would have been great.


00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.200
So, yeah, you know, you're in a car, but you, at least for me, I can't really read in the car.


00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.320
I can read a little bit, but then I'm like, you know, just one wrong turn or one bump.


00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.840
And I'm like, you know what kind of woozy.


00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.840
I don't want to read in the car anymore, but this you could totally do.


00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.280
I'm, I'm, I'm a big fan.


00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.800
I've started reading a lot more in the last week since I've been playing with this.


00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.480
Nice.


00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.460
Okay, cool.


00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.760
Yeah.


00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.960
And Pat, Pat on the audience points out that edge, the browser has good,


00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.480
voices when you use read aloud.


00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.400
So what's that?


00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.760
I think it's some kind of browser.


00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.120
Okay.


00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.080
(laughing)


00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.280
- Just kidding, you know it's Chromium.


00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.080
If you say they were browser and it's not Firefox,


00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.480
it's really just Chromium.


00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.160
- Yeah, isn't Vivaldi based on Chromium?


00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.560
- Yeah, Vivaldi is, Brave is, they all are, yeah.


00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.200
- Well, Firefox isn't, is it?


00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.040
Or is it?


00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.020
- No, but Firefox is the standout, it's the holdout.


00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.120
(laughing)


00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.920
Which is like the main reason I love them, so.


00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.720
- What I kind of, is Google like supporting them


00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.040
so that they don't look like a monopoly?


00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.880
Just to make sure that--


00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.320
I mean, I'm not saying that, but you said that anyway, I think 80 to 90% of


00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.600
Mozilla's revenue comes from Google, which I think also leads to a little


00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.400
bit of perverse incentives, right?


00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.400
Like Firefox would be better if it could be more assertive in ad


00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.160
blocking and more assertive in privacy.


00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.960
I know it kind of has it, but not really like it could go way more in like


00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.560
Vivaldi or brave does, except it's almost entirely single customer is an ad company.


00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.000
customer is an ad company.


00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.280
So, yeah, it's a little weird,


00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.880
a set up, but it does keep Firefox alive, so there's that.


00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.640
Over to you, what's next?


00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.000
>> Well, I'd like to talk about Django a little bit,


00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.280
and actually people learning about Django.


00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.880
So, I learned about this place called Djangonaut.space.


00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.840
It's where contributors launch.


00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.520
So, kind of a fun homepage,


00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.200
But I mean, if you click on anything, you go to go to just like a docs thing.


00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.200
But so that's all right.


00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.700
The Django not program is kind of neat.


00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.960
It's a program to help people learn Django, like really dig into it.


00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.720
So it's a it says this program places an emphasis on group learning,


00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.080
sustainability and longevity.


00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.680
Django knots are members of the community wish to level up their current Django code,


00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.000
contribute contributions and potentially take on leadership


00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.480
role leadership roles in Django in the future. So this is


00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.120
pretty cool. It's a self paced semi structured learning


00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.760
environment with group mentoring and it's in three month


00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.940
chunks. So and they have like different cohorts and then


00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.140
there's like, there's like different documentation on if


00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.780
you want to be a Django not if you want to be a navigator,


00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.360
which is people leading other Django knots, and then a captain


00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.200
and stuff like that.


00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.600
And this is actually just kind of a neat,


00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.640
I'd love to talk to somebody that has been involved in this


00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.840
or maybe it's new, I'm not sure.


00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.400
It doesn't look like it's been around for much


00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.600
for very long, so I'm not sure


00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.400
if they already have cohorts gone through or not,


00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.080
but I'd love to hear more about how it's going.


00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.280
'Cause this is kind of a model


00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.160
for an open source project seems neat


00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.120
of the people that kind of want to get more involved


00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.460
but really don't know what to do or how to get further,


00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.660
maybe like having a guided thing.


00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.940
That's awesome.


00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.060
The other thing, one of the things I think that's really cool


00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.020
about this is the small group setting.


00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.020
This is said cohorts are no more than four Django knots per


00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.940
one navigator and no more than eight Django knots in a group.


00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.940
You might have like two navigators per group,


00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.340
which is neat, three months.


00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.420
Then one of the things that they have access to a private Discord server,


00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.420
and then programs receive support from captains.


00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.120
So I'm not, I haven't dug in too much.


00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.780
I'm not sure what a captain does.


00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.160
They help, oh, the captains help organize the program


00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.540
and reduce the admin burden of navigators.


00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.420
Neat.


00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.840
One of the goals here is of course to do peer mentoring


00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.180
and to get people leveled up a lot.


00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.640
But one of the things that I think is really cool here


00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.080
is even if you, if you think you sign on,


00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.960
I can't find where it's in the docs right here,


00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.880
but somewhere it said, basically you sign up,


00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.800
you think you're gonna do it,


00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.680
but life happens and you need to not work on it so much.


00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.600
Do that. I mean, that's more important.


00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.800
So I love the humanity in there of saying,


00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.640
you know, personal health is always above things like this.


00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.480
So it's neat.


00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.120
- Django does community like no other web framework, right?


00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.940
- Yeah.


00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.240
- I mean, seriously, this is a fantastic idea.


00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.080
- Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.


00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.140
The welcome summary,


00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.300
Welcome in summary for the Django is pretty cool.


00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.640
Oh, here it is.


00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.100
The program will have a focus on sustainability


00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.140
and longevity.


00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.500
Remember that while we want you to be successful,


00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.920
your health and happiness comes above all else.


00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.060
I just love it.


00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.580
It seems like a cool program.


00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.420
So.


00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.140
This is great.


00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.060
So a comment from the chat.


00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.180
Kids today have it so easy.


00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.180
This makes open source contributions look like a cruise.


00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.980
I think that we just need to,


00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.860
we need to make it easier for the next generation


00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.420
to come in and help take over.


00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.900
So I think it's great.


00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.700
- Yeah, I used to have to do my pull requests


00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.880
uphill both ways.


00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.820
(laughing)


00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.240
- I used to have to mail zip files to people.


00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.980
(laughing)


00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.180
- Exactly.


00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.020
- Anyway.


00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.040
- Get all sneaker net.


00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.180
- So, all right.


00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.580
- Yeah, this is a great thing for people to sign up to.


00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.240
And I guess presumably you just go there,


00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.280
it tells you how to sign up and register


00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.740
to possibly be part of it.


00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.740
- Yeah, so let's see, if I click sign up,


00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.820
oh yeah, it takes me to a sign up form.


00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.740
Fill out your--


00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.900
- Oh, you can even sign up as a navigator or captain


00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.300
if you wanna help out, that's cool.


00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.700
- Or an other, I wanna try to sign up as a cheerleader.


00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.820
- You can't label me, man, you can't label me.


00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.380
I'm just gonna be here.


00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.380
- Other, but you have to label yourself.


00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.240
If you pick other, you have to pick something.


00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.220
- Yeah.


00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.040
- Anyway.


00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.980
All right, well, Michael, I wanna--


00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.320
- This is onto another one here.


00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.660
This one is from me, actually,


00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.660
something I created this week I wanna give a shout out to


00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.740
'cause I think it's just gonna help people a ton.


00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.580
- Okay.


00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.100
- And it's gonna lead over to maybe some more Django stuff,


00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.340
and then later we'll come back to a Google form.


00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.420
Let's start with this.


00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.020
So I'll set the stage.


00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.420
So if you're working on a website,


00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.820
especially the web design aspect of a website,


00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.220
What you often do is you'll go over to your CSS file,


00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.060
you'll make some changes, you'll have to reload your page.


00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.460
Right, you go over to the browser,


00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.780
Control or Command + R or F5, whatever your system does.


00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.980
You'll reload it, you'll look at it.


00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.980
Okay, great.


00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.660
Maybe sometimes you need it on mobile.


00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.240
So you'll have like a, one of those device,


00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.660
you know, sort of device sized changers for your browser.


00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.740
Or you could open up a real, you know,


00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.100
real iPhone or an iPhone simulator,


00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.380
point it at it, maybe you have both of those side by side.


00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.460
You've got to refresh one, refresh the other, go back to your CSS.


00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.780
Now you go over to HTML, you add some classes, go back, see how it looks,


00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.540
refresh it, right?


00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.900
What would be cool is if you could just have on a second monitor or on a large


00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.020
monitor off to the side, your browser.


00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.500
And as you type, when you hit save, regardless of whether you're editing


00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.900
CSS, JavaScript, HTML, whatever, the page just refreshes and shows you the new view.


00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.740
That'd be awesome.


00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:48.900
Right?


00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.140
Yeah.


00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.860
So I created a JavaScript script that you include only in development time.


00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.940
So don't forget that you put it on top of your page.


00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.040
It does exactly that.


00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.180
So you can have an iOS simulator running.


00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.300
You can have, you know, like brave, let's say running over there.


00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.720
And then you're over to the side, you work on your editor as you hit


00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.580
save any file you want, right?


00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:14.300
HTML templates, whether it's a CSS, JavaScript, just reloads, even images.


00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:14.980
Cool.


00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.820
Without touching it.


00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.460
Isn't that cool?


00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:16.980
Okay.


00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.220
So I've got, I've got my editor set up to just save all the time.


00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.300
So it's going to save junk.


00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.200
Does it just like, what happens if I've got junk saved?


00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:31.920
Well, so if you're typing in the HTML, it'll probably go a little bit wonky.


00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.420
Okay.


00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:32.820
Right.


00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.940
If, if, if it's Python though, it depends on what you want to do.


00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:42.720
So for me, what I found is that I'm not needing it to reload almost constantly


00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.960
when I'm doing logic of the website.


00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.280
Like sometimes I want it to, but not all the time.


00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.480
Uh, whereas when I'm actually messing with the CSS and I'm actually


00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.500
messing with, then you want it to do it all the time, then you


00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.240
want to do all the time.


00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:55.500
Right.


00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.460
So the way it works, if you don't take any action is it will reload


00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.000
if the contents of the page change.


00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.720
So if you don't restart your Python web set up, even as you type, it's not going


00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.520
to, presumably you wouldn't have it set up because like every keystroke would


00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.600
restart it and that would be like pretty annoying.


00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.680
Yeah.


00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.880
Uh, well that's what I was worried about.


00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.080
So yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.920
So, there's a few other projects like Alex, first of all, I


00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.680
was trying to give Alex Revere a shout out for helping me sort of modernize


00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.720
the script and say, Hey, that's cool.


00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.480
You want me to like a more modern version of it?


00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.400
I'm like, yes, please.


00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.080
My JavaScript is not that good.


00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.840
And then Adam chains pointed out that he created Django browser reload,


00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:42.320
which does something somewhat like this for Django where it looks and it says,


00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.080
You know, if my Django code has changed and the server has been restarted, then reload it.


00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:54.400
If it's, he says it does static files, although I haven't, I don't know that it's necessarily showing,


00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.120
um, passing through enough information to really reliably do that.


00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.560
You know, like for caching, it might still load a stale version of something.


00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.280
Uh, but anyway, if you're doing, this is like a web hook thing.


00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.480
So you install something inside of your website on the server and then this script and those like coordinate.


00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:11.800
Right.


00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.040
And I specifically decided I don't want that.


00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.120
Like this would work on node, this would work on pyramid.


00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.920
The example I'm playing with now is fast API,


00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.600
tailwind, all those things.


00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.240
So like it doesn't matter what's on the server, right?


00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.280
And so that's a trade-off 'cause it's a little bit more


00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.640
chatty checking back with a server, but not,


00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.240
I find that just I include a script, this happens,


00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.120
I don't include the script, it doesn't,


00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.200
there's no difference, that's nice to me.


00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.040
- Yeah.


00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.760
- So yeah, like I said, you just include a script


00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.080
and make sure that you don't do it in production.


00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.760
It checks by default every second,


00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.920
but you can change that to whatever.


00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.060
You can open up your dev console and toggle it on and off.


00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.480
So like, I need you to not mess with it


00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.640
'cause I'm gonna set a break point.


00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.880
And if you keep requesting this page over and over,


00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.000
you're gonna make me crazy


00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.800
and screw up the debugging session.


00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.880
So it works even indirectly.


00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.360
So like I'm doing Tailwind.


00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.200
So I added a source CSS file.


00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.080
Tailwind watches that, builds a new CSS file.


00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.680
That CSS file is included in the HTML,


00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.760
The HTML is smart enough to put a little version


00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.040
hash identifier on the CSS anytime it changes.


00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.080
That triggers a change in the HTML, which reloads.


00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.980
So same thing for images, same things for JavaScript.


00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.120
So anytime there's a static resource change,


00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.040
as long as you do something like this, it'll pick it up.


00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.300
So if you're doing web development,


00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.760
especially while you're doing the design side,


00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.000
consider grabbing this little script.


00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.240
I don't know how big it is, it's small.


00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.240
It is, let's go, pull it up.


00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.240
I don't know how many lines it is,


00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.920
probably it's like two and a half pages.


00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.200
One of those pages is comments.


00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.660
So that's no big deal.


00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.720
So you can just start in there and try it if you like.


00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.560
It's really nice.


00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.000
Even works over the network if you can like get to the server


00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.040
with ngrok or something like that.


00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.880
- Cool.


00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.340
- Yeah, so works outside of Python as well,


00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.240
but built for Python.


00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.720
Exactly, I was working on fast API when I built it.


00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.540
- Nice.


00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.440
- All right, over to you.


00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.560
What's next?


00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.120
- Well, we just, this is a hot off the presses,


00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:06.960
at least for us.


00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.400
Matthew Fikert let us know just this morning,


00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.940
hey, it seems like the day has finally come


00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.760
for Excel users to rejoice and use Python in Excel.


00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.440
So what is he talking about?


00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.300
There's an announcement from Anaconda


00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.200
that Python in Excel, next level data analysis for all.


00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.440
So what does this look like?


00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.700
It says you can write Python code directly


00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.640
in a Microsoft Excel grid, no Python install required.


00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.560
So I don't know much about this, haven't played with it,


00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.120
but it looks fun.


00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.800
It like, all you need is equal Pi, equal like PY.


00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.280
Oh, there's a little video, cool.


00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.760
So you just say Pi and then you can just type in some code.


00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.320
I don't know how much coding I wanna do right in a Python


00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.820
or in a Excel cell, I guess,


00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.180
but I don't know, it sounds kind of neat.


00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.040
Even it says that you can use Matplotlib and Seaborn


00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.120
and stuff like this.


00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.680
So I'm not sure how this works.


00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.760
Is it just built into Excel now?


00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.720
I don't know.


00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.320
Anyway, I'm excited about it.


00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.800
So I guess I should have researched it a little bit more


00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.020
before talking about it, but neat.


00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.240
- Yeah, people can check it out.


00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.740
I don't know.


00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.580
I have heard rumors of Python coming to Excel,


00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.800
and this looks like it's coming from Anaconda.


00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.240
So I'm not sure if this is the same thing


00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.200
or if this is something different.


00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.960
Yeah.


00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.640
- It says, experience the power of Python


00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.480
in Excel for yourself.


00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.600
Windows users can sign up here.


00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.760
So that's a--


00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.040
- Click on that, where does that take you?


00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.400
- A Microsoft.


00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.240
- Yeah, there you go.


00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.060
- I'm interested.


00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.560
So it's part of the 365 Insider Program right now


00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.040
to use this feature.


00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.580
So, kinda neat.


00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.600
Oh, neat, a little insert.


00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.040
Wow, start using Python.


00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.040
- Go to Python formula.


00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.480
- Insert the formula.


00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.440
- Yeah, I gotta do some more research on this


00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.080
before I can say for sure, but you know.


00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.520
I think if we can save the world from doing VBA, let's do it.


00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.960
But I think as far as getting this right,


00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.960
I think it's pretty cool to have Anaconda and Microsoft working


00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.240
together to make this work.


00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.080
I think those are the right partners to look into this.


00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.160
So yeah.


00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.800
Anyway, I wonder if I--


00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.320
I don't think I'm part of this beta channel thing.


00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.560
So I don't think I can try it.


00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.160
But I'd like to.


00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.280
Anyway.


00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.280
So that's--


00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.240
- I'm not part of the beta program either.


00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.440
I'm not that excited about Office,


00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.680
but I'm excited that this is in here.


00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.520
This is really cool.


00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.640
- Yeah, I am having to use, do more and more spreadsheets.


00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.400
As my management-y sort of things increase,


00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.320
so does Excel.


00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.560
It's just part of it.


00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.240
Anyway.


00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.440
- Yeah, there's also some other companies


00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.360
and projects out there that have


00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.240
in a Google Doc-like hosted spreadsheets


00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.280
that are purely Python based.


00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.800
I talked to, I can't remember the name,


00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.580
I don't wanna talk to so many companies


00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.880
at the startup row, I don't wanna misrepresent them,


00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.160
say, cross one over with the other.


00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.720
But that looked really, really cool as well.


00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.900
And it was only Python.


00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.200
So I don't know, there's a lot of stuff happening


00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.160
around this right now and it's pretty exciting.


00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.040
- Yeah, I guess just a step in the right direction.


00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.000
So that's good.


00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.520
- It was, like five years ago,


00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.720
this was the single biggest user voice,


00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.600
single most uploaded user voice thing


00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.000
in the Microsoft request for features and ideas.


00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.440
And it just got no reply.


00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.880
Like they just ignored it.


00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.480
There was crickets below it, right?


00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.480
And so it's interesting that it finally got some traction.


00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.920
- Yeah, yeah, I think it's pretty cool.


00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.320
So maybe, we'll see.


00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.060
If anybody out there has played with it


00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.280
or knows anything, let me know, it'd be great.


00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.540
- Yeah, or throw a comment at the bottom


00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.820
of the YouTube livestream.


00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.660
- Oh yeah, that's a good idea.


00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.380
- For folks, yeah.


00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.380
- All right, well those are our items.


00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.340
Do you have any extras for us?


00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.500
- I have two things that are extra.


00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.820
Let's talk about 'em.


00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.300
PyCon Sweden, the call for proposals is out,


00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.020
and it will be in 78 days, 12 hours, 29 minutes,


00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.460
and 16 seconds on November 9th and 10th.


00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.540
I don't know if I can attend online or in person.


00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.180
It looks like it will be at the Hilton Swedesen.


00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.660
So I'm guessing that that's not online.


00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.820
So people can check that out there.


00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.660
It sounds like it'd be pretty awesome.


00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.140
- Oh, I would totally wanna go, yeah.


00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:38.980
- I would too.


00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.060
But it's quite the flight from here.


00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.940
- Never been to Sweden.


00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.780
Anything else?


00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:45.620
- No, neither have I.


00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.660
I have been to Norway, been to Amsterdam, but not there.


00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.500
And one more thing.


00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:58.340
So I'm looking to do a talk Python episode around mobile apps and Python.


00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:03.820
And this got started as a listeners like, hey, I'd really love to hear about how you


00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:10.220
built in, you know, how was Python serving as the backend for your Flutter redesign for


00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.380
your mobile apps, right?


00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.380
Because it's all Python APIs, but it's something else on the front end.


00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:19.220
They're like, how did you decide to not use something Python for the front end?


00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.340
Or how did you decide on what you used?


00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.180
And a couple other people had some thoughts as well.


00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.900
So I think it might be really fun to do an episode where people who have created


00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.940
or work with, you know, either they're the backend dev or the front end dev or


00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.300
cross the board, created mobile apps that are actual apps in the app store.


00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.940
Not just like, Oh, I tried this framework, but if you have an app in the app store


00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.020
And it has Python involved deeply in some way, right?


00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.620
Maybe the APIs are in Python or there's some other way


00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.900
in which Python is involved.


00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.380
Maybe you're somehow embedding Python into the app


00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.060
or even, you know, maybe it's a Kivy app


00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.240
or something like that.


00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.900
If you're interested in being on Talk Python


00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.100
and a panel to kind of talk about like, you know,


00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.860
what are people doing with Python and mobile these days?


00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.000
I think that would be a lot of fun.


00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.620
Like I'd love to have you on that show.


00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.460
So the link for this is in the podcast,


00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.360
Player Show Notes, I will not read it out,


00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.420
but it says be on Talk Python around mobile apps.


00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.240
The link is tremendously long.


00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.460
So go click that in the show notes or the episode page


00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.040
and just, you know, give us your name,


00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.420
what's your app about, like how it's built


00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.780
and like maybe a couple of the really short things.


00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.940
So I'd love to put it together an episode like that,


00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.300
but it's really hard to like know who to invite


00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.980
because it's not entirely obvious


00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.580
looking in from the outside, you know?


00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.080
Yeah.


00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.580
Yeah.


00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.980
So call, it's kind of a call for proposals to talk Python, I suppose.


00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.580
And the second appearance of a Google form.


00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.700
Flet, Blaise says Flet.


00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.180
Yeah, Flet is pretty excellent.


00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.260
Flet is-- I had the Flet folks on Talk Python.


00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.380
And Flet is basically a Python wrapper around Flutter.


00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:03.860
Don't know that they have App Store support yet.


00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.460
Maybe they do.


00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.580
Is Flet the past tense of Flutter?


00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.540
I am fluttering.


00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.620
I did Flet.


00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.120
And maybe--


00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.380
- Yes, exactly.


00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.320
I have something about PyCon 2024 on there.


00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.080
But anyway, Flut is really interesting.


00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.560
I did talk to, I can't remember the guy's name


00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.600
over on Talk Python, but I remember it was not quite ready


00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.220
for the app stores, but that was a while ago.


00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.840
So if it's made it further on,


00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.680
sure Flut would be an awesome part of that discussion.


00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.200
- Neat, I think I might check it out.


00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.040
- Indeed.


00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.400
- I can't wait, yeah, can't wait.


00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.240
- Yeah, thanks.


00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.960
- Okay, so I have--


00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.800
- New extras?


00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.160
I've just, I've been so busy lately


00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.060
because I'm working on this pytest course.


00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.920
And I find, we announced it last week,


00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.620
but I finally, like yesterday morning or something,


00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.260
I finally put it up on my blog, pytest.


00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.660
So, pythontest.com/courses, you can finally find it.


00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.160
You can also find the one that I have up


00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.320
on Talk Python Training, there's a link to that.


00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.800
And it's still a great course.


00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.320
Some people ask me, was that like different?


00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.240
It is different, but it's a, the Talk Python Training one


00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.240
is a good starter one to just get you going on pytest.


00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.080
And it's still awesome.


00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.420
And it's not outdated or anything.


00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.400
The new one is just, it's like the full book.


00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.680
But I'm really trying to keep every,


00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.920
it's not just the full book,


00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.440
it's a whole bunch of extra stuff too.


00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.360
But I just wanted to mention,


00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.720
it's up on pythontest.com/courses now,


00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.240
so you don't have to find the link.


00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.280
Because it links to, it's a teachable site,


00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.760
So links to that one.


00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:41.100
But because I hadn't really announced it really everywhere,


00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.560
I've extended the last week,


00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.360
we said there was a 20% discount.


00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.360
I've extended that 20% discount till the end of the month.


00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.920
So it'll be in the show notes.


00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.640
It's just Python bytes, all one word, and it's 20% discount.


00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.980
So, and a whole bunch of people have signed up so far,


00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.460
or enough to make me believe it's a good idea to do this.


00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.600
And I really appreciate the support and the encouragement.


00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.600
I'm really having fun with the fixtures chapter


00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.060
because fixtures are a thing that is hard


00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.480
to get your head around and I'm really putting


00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.900
a lot of extra effort, putting some drawings in and stuff.


00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.780
So it's going good.


00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.080
I guess that's my extra so far is just this is going well.


00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.280
- Yeah, great, glad to hear it.


00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.600
It's exciting to see people interacting


00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.560
with the stuff you build.


00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.120
I remember when I did a Kickstarter


00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.260
for the first course that I did,


00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:34.200
I had an early access aspect to it and it was fun.


00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.280
- Yeah, and I think I'm gonna try to do,


00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.560
I'm not gonna promise this,


00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.580
but I'm gonna try to do some open hours


00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.880
or office hours things associated with this also.


00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.740
I just don't have any time this week,


00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.840
so I'm not sure when I'll try to fit that in,


00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.140
but yeah, it'll be good.


00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.160
All right. - Yeah, cool.


00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.220
- How about something funny?


00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.280
- How about two somethings funny?


00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.520
- Yeah, do you wanna start with mine or yours?


00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.920
- Yours. - Okay.


00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.660
Somebody, I can't remember where I saw this,


00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.160
but I just think it's hilarious.


00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.240
I was looking for secure password generators,


00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:09.080
And I've got one on my phone, but I wanted one like a web accessible one that I could just look up.


00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.120
Kenny Logins. It's KennyLog-in.com.


00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.920
And it's a password generator based on Kenny Logins songs.


00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.200
>>Throughout the highway to the danger zone and all those things.


00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.240
>>So you can pick.


00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.920
>>The danger zone is weak. Oh, no.


00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.440
>>The danger zone is weak. Yeah, because it's a danger zone.


00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.880
So you can just click how secure you want it, and then you hit generate.


00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.160
And then it generates a, so head up like a king.


00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.800
I don't know, with some symbols in there.


00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.080
- It's a pretty secure password for a weak one.


00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.520
- Okay, watching the river run.


00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.080
Nowhere to hide, no way to hide.


00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.320
And then, okay, so all right, I'm all right


00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.520
is all right, like security.


00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.760
And I guess they're just a little bit longer.


00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.920
Anyway, and then strong passwords, this is it.


00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.760
- There we go.


00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.360
- Yeah, those are, but there's like mixed capitalizations


00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.200
and stuff.


00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:00.880
These would be hard to remember.


00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.160
- That's actually a really good password.


00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.400
That's a totally valid one.


00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.960
- These are all pretty good.


00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.600
It's just, I thought it was really funny


00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.000
to have a themed password generator.


00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.840
It's awesome.


00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.320
(laughing)


00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.000
- So you mean the F14 with Maverick in the sky back there


00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.240
leaving a entree with a password in it.


00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.760
- I don't know if it's a generational thing,


00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.540
but I can't even hear the phrase danger zone


00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.160
without it playing in my head.


00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.000
- I know.


00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.840
(laughing)


00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.960
I know, it's pretty good stuff.


00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.800
All right.


00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.640
- Okay, what do you got?


00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.860
- Thinking with a theme here.


00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.860
The password game, do you want to play it?


00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.700
- Sure.


00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.860
- @Neil.fun/password-game.


00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:35.980
It says, choose a password.


00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.260
Okay, I like the letter A, I'll typically go with that.


00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.540
So it's gotta be five characters.


00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.420
So there we go, then it says, all right,


00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.660
cool, you passed a couple of things.


00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.340
It has to include a number, 'cause I typed five,


00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.380
A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,


00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.740
or wait, A, five, five, five, five.


00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.260
It says it must include an uppercase A.


00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.100
It must include a special character, bang.


00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.100
What else would you put?


00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.140
Your digits must add 25,


00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.460
so I gotta put another five in there.


00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.260
It could go at the end though.


00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.260
It doesn't have to be in order.


00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.140
Include a month.


00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:01.900
Must include.


00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:02.500
Yeah.


00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.620
So may.


00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.240
It must include a sponsor in here.


00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.820
So Pepsi, one of their sponsors, right?


00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.940
So it shows their sponsors.


00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.500
You got to use it.


00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.260
Whatever Roman numerals should multiply to five.


00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.980
This is all additive under the rules.


00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:20.660
Roman numerals in your, let's see what is five in a Roman numeral.


00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.300
Do you know?


00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.420
Uh, V right.


00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:23.900
Yeah.


00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.020
V and then V I I.


00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:26.980
Oh, come on.


00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.300
That's a five times seven.


00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.100
No, whatever.


00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.500
I can't do Roman numeral multiple elicitive math.


00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.020
So I'm done.


00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.300
I can't create an account apparently, but here we are.


00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:37.900
Roman.


00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:38.540
Let's look it up.


00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.820
Roman 35.


00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.060
It has to multiply.


00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.380
That's to be two numbers that multiply.


00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.580
Roman numerals in your password should multiply to 35.


00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.700
So like seven and it's like seven and five, right?


00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:49.860
Yeah.


00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.500
That's what I thought.


00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:56.140
I thought I did VII and V or is that maybe like, I can't get rid of the M.


00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:56.620
Oh yeah.


00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.980
It says there's a problem with the M cause that's may I got to do a lowercase.


00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:00.600
There we go.


00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.560
Thank you, Pat.


00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.520
Right?


00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.480
No, thank you, Mike.


00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.940
So I had may capitalized because it's a formal noun.


00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.860
Um, but it was being treated as a


00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.060
run this capture.


00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.180
Okay.


00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.020
It doesn't recapture.


00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:13.700
You got to type it.


00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.080
Yeah.


00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.740
Let's go.


00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.360
Keep going.


00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.020
Why four and six M but now my digits don't add up anymore.


00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.540
And there were digits, digits in the capture.


00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.100
Okay.


00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.140
I must include today's word.


00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.140
Okay, then I'm completely I'm done.


00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.140
Yeah, I'm out.


00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.140
I'm out.


00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.140
This is good.


00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.140
Yeah, nice.


00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:37.140
I personally just use a proper password manager and let it guess.


00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.140
Yeah, or they come up with one.


00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.140
Yeah, or Kenny Long and Kenny Loggins.


00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.140
It's always there for you.


00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.140
Oh, look at talk to me.


00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.140
Goose.


00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.140
Talk to me.


00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.140
Come on.


00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.140
Oh, look at the bottom.


00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.140
Look at all the old computers and stuff at the bottom.


00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.140
We got a Commodore.


00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.140
Oh, I love it.


00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:53.980
- Oh, I love it.


00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.900
It's got like an Atari 2600.


00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.740
- Yeah.


00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.260
- Anyway, joystick.


00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.260
- Well, this was a great episode.


00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.380
Nice, funny passwords at the end.


00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.700
Thanks a lot again.


00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.340
And we'll talk next week.
