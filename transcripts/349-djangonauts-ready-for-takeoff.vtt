00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.140
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.080
your earbuds. This is episode 349, recorded August 21st, 2023. And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.200
And I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.680
And we have a lot of exciting stuff to cover this week. But before we do, I'd like to thank

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.900
our Patreon supporters and ourselves for keeping this thing going, even without sponsors. But

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.880
if you or your company would like to sponsor Python Bytes, just talk to us. So anyway,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.580
Michael, do you want to kick us off with the first story?

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.640
Let's kick it off. Let's kick it off with some open source that's not exactly Python. But

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.380
when I talked about this on Mastodon, you know what? Mastodon hasn't even changed its name

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.680
this week. So that's pretty cool. I talked about a Mastodon. There seemed to be quite a bit of

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.140
excitement and interest in this. So I figured, you know what? Let's make this a topic for Python

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.000
Bytes. Because there's two cool open source things. So surely you've heard of Instapaper.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.720
That's the OG. I want to read something later without ads, without distractions. You know,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.640
a lot of times it's not even ads. It's just like, wow, the fonts are so small on this website or the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.840
layout is so bad, you know?

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.640
Yeah, I kind of forgot about Instapaper.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.760
Yeah. Yeah. Instapaper was the OG, right? Yeah. And then Pocket is probably the most

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.040
well-known version of that. And, you know, Pocket's kind of cool. It was either, I believe it was

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.600
acquired by, not created by Mozilla, but, you know, supporting Pocket kind of supports Mozilla,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.300
which kind of supports Firefox, which is good. But Google mostly supports Firefox. So there's that.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:52.040
So Pocket's pretty good, but there's this new project, let's say new to Michael, called Omnivore. And it is the free open source read it later app for serious readers.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:19.620
Okay. Okay. So this thing is super, super nice. The integrations with, at least I've only tested it on iOS, but the integration with iOS are incredible. So it's really easy to go from something like reader, right? Reader, which I've talked about before in the RSS world. But, you know, you pick your RSS reader of choice, go through your articles, you hit share and boom, it just goes straight into Omnivore, which is pretty cool.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:49.000
And then it has a really nice way to like categorize tag, all that kind of stuff, and then read it. So Brett Cannon, when I posted this, asked like, well, how do you find it compared to like Pocket and other stuff? Does it strip out too much, too many things? Hynek jumped in and said, oh, this is way better. It seems to err a little bit on the side and leaving potentially a little bit too much stuff in, but at the same time, not moving quotes or code sections or things like that. So really, really nice. It's, it's distraction free.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:03:02.000
So if you're privacy focused, privacy focused, open source, you can even self host it if you'd like. So for some reason you want, you're like, I'm going to read stuff and I want to make sure that it's completely private, then you can set it up and run it on your own.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.400
Oh, that's, that's pretty cool.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.360
That's pretty cool. Right.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.740
Yeah.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:22.520
And one other thing that's quite neat about it. Let me kind of pull through here a bit. So one of the things you can do, I don't know if it even shows it, but it obviously syncs where you, you've read. So you can go down and like, if you've read 23% into an article, like a long, you know, 30 minute read time article.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:39.700
And you switch to another device or to the web, it'll say, you know, here's how far you are resume from there. The other thing it does is it has text to speech, which, you know, that's, it sounds like a robot reading to you sometime. But they have a, it's like a high end text to speech option where there's not very many voices to choose from.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.940
But it sounds almost like a person reading the articles to you.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.580
Oh, wow.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:59.860
And so that is, that's super nice. And it'll show you, you can have it like highlight the words as you, as it's reading along. And so if you, you got an article to read, but really also got the yard to mow, you know, seriously, put it in the background and just go. It's actually, actually super, super neat.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:09.620
And what else I think that's probably it. There's, you can take highlights and stuff as you would expect, but it's really good for, you know, when you've got to do a lot of research on a project.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:17.500
It's, I think it's really good for us. Honestly, we read a lot of articles and you want to take notes, you know, highlight a section, add a note about why that's relevant and stuff.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:27.020
So when we go back to one of these long articles and we're like, Hey, I want to tell Brian about it or vice versa. You're like, what was the part of this that actually stood out here? It is, you know, you just bump through it. So really, really neat.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:38.080
And then it said, you can also sync it with other stuff like your second brain things. I'm like, wait, what is it talking about? It says you can connect it to things like log sec.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.580
Log sec is another open source thing. That's kind of like notion, but running locally, I think runs locally.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.180
Anyway, so here's something else that I discovered along the way. That's also pretty excellent.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:04.480
So you can do like whiteboards with like YouTube videos that connect over to different parts and like these sort of, it's kind of funky, but I haven't used that much, but omnivore strong recommendation for this.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.720
People should definitely, definitely check it out.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.420
Oh, that's pretty cool. I would also, I was thinking about that text to speech thing. I would have loved that when I was in college and I had to read a bunch of junk.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.080
Oh gosh, I know.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.460
And I'm on the bus or something. It would have been great.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:25.340
Yeah. Or, you know, you're in a car, but you, at least for me, I can't really read in the car. I can read a little bit, but then I'm like, you know, just one wrong turn or one bump.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.200
And I'm like, you know what? Kind of woozy. I don't want to read in the car anymore.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.800
But this you could totally do. I'm, I'm, I'm a big fan. I've started reading a lot more in the last week since I've been playing with this.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.380
Nice. Okay, cool.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.340
Yeah. And Pat, Pat on the audience points out that edge, the browser has good voices when you read aloud.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.800
So pretty cool.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.360
What's that?

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.700
I think it's some kind of browser.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.080
Okay.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.180
Just kidding. You know, it's Chromium. If you say the word browser and it's not Firefox, it's really just Chromium.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.880
Yeah. Isn't, isn't Vivaldi based on Chromium?

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.400
Yeah, Vivaldi is. Brave is. They all are, yeah.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.540
Well, Firefox isn't, is it? Or is it?

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.880
No, but Firefox is the standout. It's the holdout.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.360
Which, which is like the main reason I love them.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.780
So what I kind of is, is Google like supporting them so that they don't look like a monopoly just to make sure that.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.060
That's a pretty strong theory, isn't it?

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.460
Yeah.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.880
I mean, I'm not saying that, but you said that.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.420
Anyway.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:29.440
I think 80 to 90% of Mozilla's revenue comes from Google, which I think also leads to a little bit of perverse incentives, right?

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.120
Like Firefox would be better if it could be more assertive in ad blocking and more assertive in privacy.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.140
I know it kind of has it, but not really.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:44.740
Like it could go way more in like Vivaldi or Brave does, except it's almost entirely single customer is an ad company.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.460
So yeah, how much, yeah, it's, it's a little, it's a little weird set up, but it does keep Firefox alive.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.980
So there's that over to you.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.380
What's next?

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.020
Well, I'd like to talk about Django a little bit and actually people learning about Django.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.440
So I learned about this place called Django, not Django, not dot space.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.660
It's where contributors launch.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.780
So kind of a fun, kind of a fun drop or homepage.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.180
But I mean, if you click on anything, you go to go to just like a docs thing.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.180
But so the, but that's all right.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.640
The Django not program is kind of neat.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.980
It's a program to help people learn Django, like really dig into it.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:34.180
So it's a, it says this program places an emphasis on group learning, sustainability, and longevity.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:45.720
Djangonauts are members of the community who wish to level up their current Django code contribute contributions and potentially take on leadership roles in Django in the future.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.060
So this is pretty cool.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:54.280
It's a self-paced, semi-structured learning environment with group mentoring, and it's in three month chunks.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:08.160
So, and they have like different cohorts and then there's like, there's like different documentation on if you want to be a Django not, if you want to be a navigator, which is people leading other Djangonauts, and then a captain and stuff like that.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:14.840
And this is actually just kind of a neat, I'd love to talk to somebody that has been involved in this, or maybe it's new.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.320
I'm not sure.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.980
It's a, it doesn't look like it's been around for much for very long.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.540
So I'm not sure if they already have cohorts gone through or not, but I'd love to hear more about how it's going.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:34.340
And because it's kind of a model for an open source project seems neat of let the people that kind of want to get more involved, but really don't know what to do or how to get further.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.520
Maybe like having a guided thing.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.360
That's awesome.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:43.920
So the other thing, one of the things I think that's really cool about this is the small group setting.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:51.540
So this is a said cohorts are no more than four Djangonauts per one navigator and no more than eight Djangonauts in a group.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.080
So you might have like two navigators per group, which is kind of neat, three months.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:04.360
And then one of the things that they have access to a private discord server and then programs receive support from captains.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.040
So I'm not, I haven't dug in too much.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.220
I'm not sure what a captain does.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.900
They help.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.200
Oh, the captains help organize the program and reduce the admin burden of navigators.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.800
Neat.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.840
One of the goals here is of course to do peer mentoring and to get people leveled up a lot.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:37.500
But one of the things that I think is really cool here is even if you, if you think you sign on, I can't find words in the docs right here, but it somewhere it said, basically you sign up, you think you're going to do it, but life happens and you need to not work on it so much.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.240
Do that.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.440
I mean, that's more important.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:46.340
So I love the humanity in there of saying, you know, personal health is always above things like this.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.320
So it's neat.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.940
Django does community like no other way, web framework, right?

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.280
Yeah.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.840
I mean, seriously, this is a fantastic idea.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.340
Yeah.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.320
I think it's pretty cool.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.260
The, the, the welcome summary, welcome in summary for the Django is pretty cool.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.420
Oh, here, here it is.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.640
The program will have a focus on sustainability and longevity.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.740
Remember that while we want you to be successful, your health and happiness comes above all else.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.500
I just love it.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.040
It seems like a cool program.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.160
Yeah, that's cool.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.700
So.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.360
This is great.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.100
So a comment from the chat.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.060
Kids, these kids today have it so easy.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.100
This makes open source contributions look like a cruise.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.100
I think that we, we just need to, we need to make it easier for the next generation to come

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.180
in and help take over.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.440
So I think it's great.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.060
Yeah.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.720
I used to have to do my pull requests uphill both ways.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.120
I used to have to mail zip files to people.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.220
Exactly.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.440
Anyway.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.800
Get all sneaker net.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.020
So, all right.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.300
Yeah.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.520
This is a great, this is a great thing for people to sign up to.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.160
And I guess presumably you just go there.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.420
It tells you how to sign up and register to possibly be part of it.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:00.900
Yeah.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.460
So let's see if I click sign up it.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.040
Oh yeah.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.400
It takes me to a signup form.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.420
You fill out your.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.500
Oh, you can even sign up as a navigator or a captain if you want to help out.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:09.720
Yeah.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.040
That's cool.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.900
Or an other.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.540
I want to try to sign up as a cheerleader.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.540
You can't label me, man.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.320
You can't label me.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.500
I'm just going to be here.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.560
Other.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.000
But you have to label yourself.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.960
If you, if you pick other, you have to pick something.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.080
Yeah.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.520
Yeah.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.380
All right.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.520
Well, Michael, I want to.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.280
This is on to another one here.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.540
This one is from me, actually, something I created this week.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.360
I want to give a shout out to, because I think it's just going to help people a ton.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:38.900
Okay.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.780
And it's going to lead over to maybe some more Django stuff.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.660
And then later we'll come back to a Google form.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.040
Let's start with this.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.640
So I'll set the stage.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.800
So if you're working on a website, especially the web design aspect of a website.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.500
Okay.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.860
What you often do is you'll, you'll go over to your CSS file.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.060
You'll make some changes.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.660
You'll have to reload your page.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.180
Right.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.440
You'll go over to the browser controller or command R or F5, whatever your system does.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.300
You'll reload it.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:06.880
You'll look at it.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.220
Okay.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:07.720
Great.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.460
Maybe sometimes you need it on mobile.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:16.560
So you'll have like a, one of those device, you know, sort of device sized changers for your browser.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.700
Or you could open up a real, you know, real iPhone or an iPhone simulator pointed at it.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.300
Maybe a both of those side by side.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.060
So you've got to refresh one, refresh the other.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.160
Go back to your CSS.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.800
Now you go over to your HTML, you add some, classes, go back, see how it looks.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.260
Refresh it.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:31.480
Right.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:39.040
What would be cool is if you could just have on a second monitor or on a large monitor off to the side, your browser.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:47.900
And as you type, when you hit save, regardless of whether you're editing CSS, JavaScript, HTML, whatever, the page just refreshes and shows you the new view.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.720
That'd be awesome.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:48.900
Right?

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.120
Yeah.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.860
So I created a JavaScript script that you include only in development time.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.700
So don't forget that.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.880
You put it at the top of your page.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.020
It does exactly that.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.000
So you can have an iOS simulator running.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.200
You can have, you know, like brave, let's say running over there and then you're over to the side, you're working on your editor.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.540
And as you hit save any file you want, right?

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:14.240
HTML templates, whether it's a CSS, JavaScript, just reloads, even images.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:14.880
Cool.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.860
Without touching it.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.380
Isn't that cool?

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:16.900
Okay.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.200
So I've got, I've got my editor set up to just save all the time.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.220
So it's going to save junk.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.180
Does it just like, what happens if I've got junk saved?

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:31.840
Well, so if you're typing in the HTML, it'll probably go a little bit wonky.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.240
Okay.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:32.720
Right.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.960
If, if, if it's Python though, it depends on what you want to do.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:44.920
So for me, what I found is that I'm not needing it to reload almost constantly when I'm doing logic of the website.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.120
Yeah.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.280
Like sometimes I want it to, but not all the time.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.100
whereas when I'm actually messing with the CSS and I'm actually messing with.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:52.400
Yeah.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.920
Then you want it to do it all the time.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.240
Yeah.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.240
Then you want to do all the time.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:55.480
Right.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.980
So the way it works, if you don't take any action is it will reload if the contents of the page change.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:07.140
So if you don't restart your Python web setup, even as you type, it's not going to.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:07.640
Yeah.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.260
Presumably you wouldn't have it set up.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.620
Cause like every keystroke would restart it and that would be like pretty annoying.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.720
Yeah.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.860
well, that's what I was worried about.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:16.640
Yeah.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:16.820
Yeah.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.080
Yeah.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:23.820
So, there's a few other projects like Alex, first of all, I just want to give Alex

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.140
Riviera a shout out for helping me sort of modernize the script.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:27.740
He says, Hey, that's cool.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.480
You want me to like a more modern version of it?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.380
I'm like, yes, please.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.120
My JavaScript is not that good.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:38.500
And then Adam chains pointed out that he created Django browser reload, which does something

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:44.560
somewhat like this for Django where it looks and it says, you know, if my Django code has

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.080
changed and the server has been restarted, then reloaded.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.620
If, it's, he says it does static files, although, haven't, I don't know that it's

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:58.140
necessarily showing, passing through enough information to really reliably do that.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.560
You know, like for caching, it might still load a stale version of something.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:07.060
but anyway, if you're doing this as like a web hook thing, so you install something inside

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.440
of your website on the server and then the script and those like coordinate.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:11.740
Right.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.740
And I specifically decided I don't want that.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.780
Like this would work on node.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.820
This would work on human.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.500
The example I'm playing with now is FastAPI tailwind, all those things.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.880
So like, it doesn't matter what's on the server.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.180
Right.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.660
And so that's a trade-off cause it, it's a little bit more chatty checking back with

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.720
a server, but not, I find that just I include a script.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.160
This happens.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.120
I don't include the script.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.040
It doesn't know that there's no difference that that's nice to me.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.360
Yeah.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.260
So, yeah, like I said, you just include a script and make sure that you don't do it

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:43.660
in production.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.680
It checks by default every second, but you can change that to whatever you can open

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.960
up your dev console and toggle it on and off.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.560
So like, I need you to not mess with it cause I'm going to set a break point.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.340
And if you keep requesting this page over and over, you're going to make me crazy and screw

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.400
up the debugging session.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.780
so it works even indirectly.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.780
So like I'm doing tailwind, so I added a source CSS file tailwind watches that builds a new

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.540
CSS file that CSS files included in the HTML.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:16.660
The HTML is smart enough to put a little like version hash identifier on the CSS.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.940
Anytime it changes that triggers a change to the HTML, which reloads.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.660
So like same thing for images, same things for JavaScript.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.300
So anytime there's like a static resource change, as long as you do something like this, it'll

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:26.760
pick it up.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.540
So if you're doing web development, especially the, while you're doing the design side, you

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.260
you know, consider grabbing this little script.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.800
I don't know how big it is.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.800
It's small.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.640
It is.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.940
Let's go pull it up.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.220
I don't know how many lines it is.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.820
Probably it's like two and a half pages.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.060
One of those pages is comments.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.600
So that's, that's no big deal.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.860
So you can just throw it in there and try it if you like.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.220
it's really nice.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.440
Even works over the network.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.220
If you can like get to the server with Ngrok or something like that.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:52.840
Oh yeah.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.180
Cool.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:53.660
Yeah.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.800
So it works outside of Python as well, but I built for Python.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.540
Exactly.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.500
I was working on FastAPI when I built it.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:00.980
Nice.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:01.680
All right.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.320
Over to you.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:02.820
What's next?

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.780
Well, we just, this is a hot off the presses, at least for us.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:13.220
my Matthew Feikert, let us know this more just this morning.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:18.860
Hey, it seems like, the day has finally come for Excel users to rejoice and use Python

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.560
in Excel.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.180
So what is he talking about?

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.360
There's an announcement from Anaconda that, Python and Excel next level data analysis

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:26.920
for all.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.500
So what does this look like?

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.340
it says you can write Python code directly in a Microsoft Excel grid.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.220
No Python install required.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.720
So I don't know much about this.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.640
I haven't played with it, but it looks fun.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.240
It like, all you need is equal PI equal, like P Y.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.840
Oh, there's a little video.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.160
Cool.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.540
So you just say PI and then you can just type in some code.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:55.900
I don't know how much coding I want to do right in a Python or in a Excel, cell,

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:56.500
I guess.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.880
But, but I don't know.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.700
It sounds kind of neat.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:04.100
even in, it says that you can use matplotlib and seaborne and stuff like this.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.660
So I'm not sure how this works.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.700
Is it just built into Excel now?

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.260
I don't know.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.280
But anyway, I'm excited about it.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.760
So I guess I should have researched it a little bit more before talking about it, but neat.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.160
Yeah.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.120
People can check it out.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.520
I, I don't know.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:24.900
I have heard rumors of Python coming to Excel and this looks like it's coming from Anaconda.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.540
Yeah.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.940
So I'm not sure if this is the same thing or if this is something different.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.420
Yeah.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.380
It says, experience, experience the power of Python and Excel for yourself.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.360
Windows users can sign up here.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.120
So that's a click on that.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:39.720
Where's that take you?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.740
a Microsoft.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.800
Yeah, there you go.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.260
I'm interested.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.260
So it is, it's part of the 365 insider program right now to use this feature.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.300
So, kind of neat.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.160
oh, neat.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.260
A little, insert.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:54.880
Wow.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.860
Start using Python.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.660
Python formula.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:56.840
Yeah.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.800
Insert the formula.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.380
Huh?

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:58.580
Yeah.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.960
I gotta, I gotta do some more research on this before I can, I can say for sure.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:07.320
But, you know, I think if, if we can save the world from doing VBA, let's do it.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.220
But I think it's, it's, as far as getting this right, I think it's pretty cool to have Anaconda and

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.080
Microsoft working together to make this work.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.980
Like there's, those are the right partners to, to look into this.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.820
So, yeah.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.400
Anyway.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.060
I wonder if I don't think I'm part of this beta channel thing.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.380
So I don't think I can try it, but yeah, I'd like to anyway.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.240
So that's.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:30.320
Yeah.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.040
I, I'm not part of the beta program either.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.020
I'm not that excited about office, but I'm excited that this is, you know, this is really

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:38.240
cool.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:38.720
Yeah.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:44.840
I am having to use, do it more and more spreadsheets as, as my management, the sort of things

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.420
increase.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.460
so does Excel.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.640
it's just part of it anyway.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.800
Yeah.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.280
Yeah.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.960
There's also some other companies and projects out there that have in a Google doc, like hosted

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.900
spreadsheets that are purely Python based.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.740
I talked to, I can't remember the name.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.260
I don't want to talk to so many companies at the startup row.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.520
I don't want to miss represent them.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.020
I would say, you know, cross one over with the other, but that looked really, really cool

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:12.820
as well.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.760
and it was only Python.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.960
So I don't know if there's a lot of, a lot of stuff happening around this right now and

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.860
it's, it's pretty exciting.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.320
Yeah.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.900
I guess just a step in the right direction.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.840
So that's good.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.400
It was like five years ago.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:33.120
This was the single biggest user voice, single, most uploaded user voice thing in the Microsoft

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.640
request for features and ideas.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.340
And it just got no reply.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.740
Like they just ignored it.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.560
There was crickets below it.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:41.800
Right.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.840
And, so it's, it's interesting that it, you know, finally got some traction.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.780
Yeah.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.640
Yeah.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.700
I think it's pretty cool.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:55.780
So maybe we'll see, if anybody out there is, is, has played with it or knows anything,

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.500
let me know.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.040
Be great.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.460
Yeah.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.660
Or, throw a comment at the bottom of YouTube live stream.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.080
Oh yeah.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.460
That's good.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:01.860
For folks.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.400
Yeah.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.660
All right.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:03.880
All right.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.260
Well, those are our items.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.020
do you have any extras for us?

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.200
I have two things that are extra.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.460
Let's talk about them.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.720
PyCon Sweden.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:21.160
The call for proposals is out and it will be in 78 days, 12 hours, 29 minutes, 16 seconds

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.760
on November 9th and 10th.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:23.300
Okay.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.460
Don't know if I can attend online or in person.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.920
It looks like it will be at the Hilton Srdusen.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.340
So I'm guessing that that's not online.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.740
So people can check that out there.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.300
It sounds like it'd be pretty awesome.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.920
I was near Sweden.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.580
I would go to.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.640
I would too.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.220
Yeah.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.100
But it's quite the flight from here.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:41.700
So.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.880
Never been to Sweden.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.100
All right.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.320
anything else?

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.340
No, neither have I.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.380
I have been to Norway, been to Amsterdam, but not there.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.220
And one more thing.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:57.400
So I'm looking to do, a talk Python episode around mobile apps and Python.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:11.040
And this got started as a listeners like, Hey, I'd really love to hear about how you built in, you know, how was Python serving as the backend for your flutter redesign for your mobile apps?

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.280
Right.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.360
Cause it's all Python APIs, but it's something else on the front end.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.220
They're like, how did you decide to not use something Python for the front end?

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.340
Or how did you decide on what you used?

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.200
And a couple other people had some thoughts as well.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:38.280
So I think it might be really fun to do an episode where people who have created or work with, you know, either they're the backend dev or the front end dev or cross the board created mobile apps that are actual apps in the app store.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:45.980
Or not just like, Oh, I tried this framework, but if you have an app in the app store and it has Python involved deeply in some way, right?

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.820
Maybe the APIs are in Python or there's some other way in which Python is involved.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:58.020
Maybe you're somehow embedding Python into the app, or even, you know, maybe it's a Kivi app or something like that.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:06.260
If you're interested in being on talk Python and a panel to kind of talk about like, you know, what, what are people doing with Python and mobile these days?

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:06.980
Right.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:07.960
I think that would be a lot of fun.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.540
Like, I I'd love to have you on that show.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.040
So the link for this is in the podcast platter show notes.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.680
I will not read it out, but it says beyond talk Python around mobile apps.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.180
the link is tremendously long.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:27.860
So go click that in the show notes or the episode page and just, you know, give us your name.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.740
What's your app about, like how, how it's building and like maybe a couple of the really short things.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:40.360
So I'd love to put it together in an episode like that, but it's really hard to like know who to invite because it's not entirely obvious looking in from the outside, you know?

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:40.760
Yeah.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.160
Yeah.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.220
Yeah.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.580
So call, it's kind of a call for proposals to talk Python, I suppose.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.660
And the second appearance of a Google form.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.800
Flutter.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.640
Blase says Flutter.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:49.840
Yeah.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.860
Flutter is pretty excellent.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:57.980
Flutter is, I had the Flutter folks on talk Python and, what is basically a Python wrapper around Flutter.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.540
Don't know that they have, app store support yet.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.560
maybe they do.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.060
Is Flutter the past tense of Flutter?

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.320
I am fluttering.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.260
I did Flutter.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:08.920
Maybe.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.920
Yes, exactly.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.980
that has something about PyCon 2024 on there.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.780
But anyway, Flutter is really interesting.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:24.140
I did talk to, I can't remember the guy's name over on talk Python, but I remember it was not quite ready for the app stores, but that was a while ago.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.420
So if it's made it further on, sure, Flutter would be an awesome part of that discussion.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.020
Neat.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.340
I think I might check it out.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:30.940
Yeah.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.360
I can't wait.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:31.580
Yeah.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:31.880
All right.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.520
Can't wait.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:32.920
So.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.540
Yeah.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:33.880
Thanks.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.340
Okay.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.900
So I have.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.260
Extras.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:50.460
I have, I've just, I've been so busy lately, because I'm working on this pytest course and I find, we announced it last week, but I finally, like yesterday morning or something, I finally put it up on my blog.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:50.960
pytest.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.480
So pythontest.com courses.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.600
You can finally find it.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.100
You can also find the one that I have up on Talk Python Training.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.040
There's a link to that.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.280
And it's still a great course.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.060
Some, but some people asked me, was that like different?

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:11.900
It is different, but it's, it's a, the Talk Python Training one is like a, is a, is a good like starter one to like, just get, get you going on pytest.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.300
and it's still awesome.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.720
and it's not outdated or anything.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:22.840
the new one is just, is like the full book, but I'm, I'm, I'm really trying to keep every, it's not just the full book.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.120
It's a whole bunch of extra stuff too.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:29.600
But, it's not, I just wanted to mention it's up on, pythontest.com slash courses now.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:35.180
So you don't have to find the link because it, it links to, it's a teachable site.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.500
So it links to that one.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.700
But the, because I hadn't really announced it really everywhere.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:45.040
I've extended the, last, last week we said there was a 20% discount.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.000
I've extended that 20% discount till the end of the month.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.820
So it'll be in the show notes.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.440
It's just Python bytes and all one word and it's 20% discount.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:26:01.380
So, and a whole bunch of people have, signed up so far, or enough to make me believe it's a good idea to do this.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.900
And I really appreciate the support and the encouragement.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:10.800
I'm really having fun with the fixtures, chapter because fixtures are a thing that is hard to get your head around.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.800
And I'm really, putting a lot of extra effort, putting some drawings in stuff.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.820
So it's going good.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.440
I guess that's my extra so far is just, this is going well.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:20.220
Yeah.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:20.560
Great.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.280
Glad to hear it.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.300
It's, exciting to see people interacting with the stuff you build.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:25.540
Isn't it?

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:33.580
I remember when I did a Kickstarter for the first course that I did, I had an early access aspect to it and it was, it was good.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:33.960
It was fun.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.340
Yeah.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:41.840
And I think I'm going to try to do, I'm not going to promise this, but I'm going to try to do some open hours or office hours things associated with this also.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:48.540
I just don't have any time this week, so I'm not sure when I'll try to fit that in, but, yeah, it'll be good.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.400
All right.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:49.620
Yeah.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:49.840
Cool.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.240
How about something funny?

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.580
How about two?

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.160
Something's funny.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:53.520
Yeah.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.200
Do you want to start with mine or yours?

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.780
Yours.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.180
Okay.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.680
somebody, I can't remember where I saw this, but I just think it's hilarious.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:08.880
I was looking for password, secure password generators and I've got one on my phone, but, but I wanted one, like a web accessible one that I could just look up.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.920
Kenny logins.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.800
It's Kenny log dash in.com.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.480
And it's a password generator based on Kenny logins.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.560
Something about the highway to the dangers.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.080
Yeah.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:20.080
Yeah.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:20.740
And all those things.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.200
So you can, so you can pick,

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.400
Oh, the danger zone is weak.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:23.860
Oh no.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.000
The danger zone is weak.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.260
Yeah.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.380
Cause it's a danger zone.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.240
So you can just, click which, how secure you want it.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.920
And then you hit generate and then it generates, so head up like a king.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.660
I don't know what's some symbols in there.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.960
It's a pretty secure password for a weak one.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.360
Okay.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.220
Watching the river run.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.140
nowhere to hide.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:43.980
No way to hide.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.700
And then, okay.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.480
So all right.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.240
I'm all right.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.140
Is all right.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.140
Like security.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.680
And, I guess they're just a little bit longer.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.960
anyway, this, and then strong passwords.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.660
This is it.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.360
There we go.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:55.600
Yeah.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.800
Those are, but there's like, mixed capitalizations and stuff.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.900
these would be hard to remember.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.020
It's actually a really good password.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.120
That's a totally valid one.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.540
These are all pretty good.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.740
it's just, I thought it was really funny to have a themed password generator.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.520
It's awesome.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:16.860
So me in the F14 with Maverick in the sky back there, leaving a pond trail with a password.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:23.040
And I don't know if it's a generational thing, but I can't even hear the phrase danger zone without it playing in my head.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:23.500
I know.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.880
I know it's pretty good stuff.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.220
All right.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:26.600
Okay.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.260
What do you got?

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.680
Speaking with a theme here, the password game.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.360
Do you want to play it?

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.120
Sure.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.560
At Neil dot fun slash password dash game.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.860
It says choose a password.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:36.220
Okay.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.580
I like the letter A.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.840
I typically go with that.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.980
So it's got to be, five characters.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.320
So there we go.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.520
Then it says, all right, cool.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.560
You passed a couple of things.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.020
It has to include a number because I typed five, A, A, A, A.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.480
Oh, wait, A, five, five, five, five.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.120
It says it must include an uppercase.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.460
A must include a special character.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:53.940
Bang.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.800
What else would you put?

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.960
Your digits must add 25.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.360
So I got to put another five in there.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.200
It could go at the end though.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.120
It doesn't have to be in order.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.100
Include a monthly.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:01.800
It must include.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.460
Yeah.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.480
So may.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.200
Must include a sponsor in here.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.740
So Pepsi, one of their sponsors, right?

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.820
So it shows their sponsors.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.520
You got to use it.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.140
Whatever.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.220
Roman numerals should multiply to five.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.920
This is all additive under the rules.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.880
Roman numerals in your, let's see.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.480
What is five in a Roman numeral?

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.240
Do you know?

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.100
V right?

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.380
Right.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:23.840
Yeah.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.920
V and then V I I.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.920
Oh, come on.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.240
That's, it's five times seven.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.000
No, whatever.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.480
I can't do Roman numeral multiple, like it of math.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.040
So I'm done.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.300
I can't create an account apparently, but here we are.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:37.860
Roman.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.580
Let's look it up.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.800
Roman 35.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.000
It has to multiply.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.320
It has to be two numbers that multiply.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.320
Roman numbers in your password should multiply to 35.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.680
So like seven and it's like seven and five, right?

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:49.920
Yeah.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.480
That's what I thought.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.640
I thought I did seven.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.140
I, I and V or is that maybe like, I can't get rid of the M.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:56.600
Oh yeah.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.920
It says there's a problem with the M.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.660
Cause that's may.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.940
I got to do a lowercase.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:00.560
There we go.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.540
Thank you, Pat.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.520
Right.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:02.760
No.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.460
Thank you, Mike.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.900
So I had may capitalize cause it's a formal noun.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.080
but it was being treated as a room.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.000
This capture.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.120
Okay.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:12.820
Does a recap.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:13.760
So you got to type it.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.140
Yeah.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.740
Let's go.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.280
Keep going.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.160
Y4N6M.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.020
But now my digits don't add up anymore.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:19.800
And there were digits.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.300
There were digits in the capture.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.080
Okay.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.160
I must include today's word.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:25.520
Okay.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.260
Then I'm, I'm completely.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:28.900
I'm done.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.260
Yeah.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:29.600
I'm out.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.380
I'm out.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.440
This is good.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.780
Yeah.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:33.560
Nice.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.100
I personally just use a proper password manager and let it guess.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.580
Yeah.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.500
Or they come up with one.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.040
Yeah.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.220
Or Kenny Loggins.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:41.920
Kenny Loggins.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.040
It's always there for you.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.880
Oh, look at.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.600
Talk to me, Goose.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.080
Talk to me.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:48.420
Come on.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.280
Oh, look at the bottom.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.900
look at all the old computers and stuff at the bottom.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.780
We got a Commodore.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.780
Oh, I love it.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.520
It's got like an Atari 2600.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.200
Yeah.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.080
Anyway.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:57.980
Joystick.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.560
Ah, well, this was a great episode.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.020
nice, funny passwords at the end.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.280
Thanks a lot again.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.080
And, yeah, we'll talk next week.
