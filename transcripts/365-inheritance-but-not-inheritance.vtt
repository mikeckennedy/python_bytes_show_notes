00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.140
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.780
This is episode 365. Wow. Recorded.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.920
It's like we've been doing it for a year.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.500
Yeah. Recorded December 19th, 2023.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.580
Yeah. And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.200
Hey, I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:32.660
And yeah, if we did it, if somebody listened to one a day from now on, they would be behind because we'll be way ahead of 365 by the time they finish.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.280
Still be awesome.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.500
Well, want to kick us off with something cool?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.800
Oh, before we kick it off.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.660
Yeah, go ahead.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.220
Let's say that this episode is sponsored by us.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.240
So please support us and other people.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.440
I'm going to talk about that a little bit later at the end of the show.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.200
But also check out all the courses that Talk Python Training.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.040
Check out the complete pytest course.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.700
You can be a Patreon supporter.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.980
And also, if you want to connect with us, one of the best ways to do it is through on Mastodon.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.720
And we're all on Fosstodon, or at least Michael and I are.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.580
At M. Kennedy, at Brian Okken, and at Python Bytes.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.980
Indeed.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.820
Hey, do I feel like I'm really fast, Brian?

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.320
Like Neo in the Matrix?

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200
Mind-bendingly fast?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.520
Let's go with yes.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.440
Okay.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.540
I appreciate that.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.060
Because this, I just got fiber, gigabit fiber installed 30 minutes ago.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.800
I was hoping it wouldn't destroy the show, but it almost didn't make it, but it made it.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.480
Ooh.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.360
Nice.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.740
So hopefully that doesn't curse it, that something doesn't go wrong and it will crash.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.600
But 950 megabit down, which is fine, but 950 megabit up is glorious.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.600
We should speed up the playback speed when we release the MP3 so it sounds really fast.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840
No, we're talking really fast because it's really uploading.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.080
Yeah.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.780
No, let's talk about Hatch because Hatch is awesome.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.200
Ofek is the maintainer and creator of Hatch.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.460
And boy, oh boy, has he gone big on his latest release, 1.8.0.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:19.220
So Hatch is like Flit, is like PDM, is like pip, ENV, and many of these other poetry.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.620
Others, if I'm leaving your version of this out, I apologize.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.580
But with version 1.8, this has gone in a bit of a different direction.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.020
You know, I had Ofek on the Python packaging panel.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.580
I think Steve Dower was there.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.600
Some other folks were there.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:46.680
Really interesting that there's this tension between should there be an app that manages

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.480
Python environments with Python, or should there be a thing that manages the Python itself?

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.480
Right?

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.200
Kind of like PyEMV, for example.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.060
Right?

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.880
So Hatch has gone in that direction of now Hatch manages Python, not just Python projects.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.740
And there's this thing to solve this problem in the form of PyApp.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.180
So PyApp is even maybe more awesome.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.300
PyApp is a runtime installer for Python projects written in Rust.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.160
And they can be, you ready for this?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.700
I'm so, so excited.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.960
Your Python app can be distributed as a standalone executable, a .exe or .app for users.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.020
What do you think, Brian?

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.640
I'm very interested in finding out more.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.180
Now, this whole post is a little bit wordy.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.960
So let me jump into the omnivore version of it over here, which has a huge icon.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.520
So Ofek says, look, one of the things that's been a perpetual problem for Hatch and all the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.160
others I named is that Python itself is a dependency.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.200
So in order to use Hatch or any of these other tools or any apps, you have to say, well, go

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.700
get Python and then get back to me and we'll start talking.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.960
Right?

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.500
So he came up with this thing called PyApp that will create installers for the different platforms.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.660
Claims it's trivial.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.520
It's probably never trivial, but possible.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.240
Possible would be awesome even.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:20.500
And so starting with this releases, not only are the binaries available for every platform,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.220
but there are installers as in like install wizards on Windows and a DMG type thing, I'm

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.680
guessing, or a PKG on macOS.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.560
That's awesome.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:41.320
If you have ever in the recent days tried to put something onto macOS or Windows, there's

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.260
a whole nightmare of digitally signing around it, Brian.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.540
So you can't just get a binary and give it to somebody.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.200
The platforms will freak out.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.360
They won't let you open it.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.320
Like macOS will not let you open it unless you go into settings and say, allow me to run

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.220
apps from untrusted developers.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.020
And Windows gives you this big, scary dialogue and tries to not run it.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.980
So that's why this next part-

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.420
It's not developers that you don't trust.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.480
It's developers that Apple doesn't trust.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.440
Yes, exactly.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.960
You may or may not trust them, but that's a different conversation.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.460
It's a fair feature, but it makes creating desktop distributable apps super painful.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.120
So check this out.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.160
Halfway there.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.660
The installer for macOS is signed using a certificate.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.840
So you already, your apps built with this are already trusted.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.980
Honestly, I don't know how this is possible.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.860
I mean, I know why, how it works.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.120
I'm not sure that it, how it's allowed, but I'm all for it.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.780
So, because I have dealt with Apple and they are not lenient in any way, shape or form when

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.460
it comes to stuff running on their platform.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.340
But so the installer for the macOS is signed using the certificate from the same account

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.620
used to sign the official distributions of Python.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.060
So you won't get any security warnings or blocking.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.240
Thank you, Ederbin, for helping out with that.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.980
And Hatch itself with any good system is self-updating.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.660
So you can hatch self-update.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.940
What else I want to point out?

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.100
There's also a new Python, like hatch space Python command group that will allow you to

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.740
manage things.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.080
So you can show what you have installed.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.620
You can install different versions of Python, CPython and PyPy for those.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.940
It works with virtual environments.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.640
It has built in rough and Ruff format integrations.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:36.880
And traditionally, it's been somewhat slow to like activate and set up a virtual environment

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.160
that's already previously been installed because it'll refresh and recheck that all of the dependencies

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.000
are there and everything.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.300
So now it does a hash of those.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.680
And so only if the dependency statement doesn't match the hash, right?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.260
Basically, so it'll pre-compute all that stuff.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.260
So now it should be basically instant.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.340
So also some minor breaking changes around build defaults.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.780
And the new app build target is what I've been raving about.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.620
So, OFAC, you killed it.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.400
Can't believe it.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.820
It's awesome.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.420
Awesome.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.920
So Hatch has hashes?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:19.960
If you hash a hatch with hashling and, you know, like there's some kind of tongue twister

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.640
in there we could do.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.880
I'm not doing it though.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.220
Gotta be.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.260
I'm excited about this.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.400
It's very cool.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.100
I definitely want to play with it.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.760
Yeah.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.240
Yes, indeed.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.880
Over to you.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.940
All right.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:41.780
Well, I'm not sure how long this has been out, but Hinnick has been promoting a new project

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.780
that he's got called services.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.900
He's got called services or SVCS, which is short for services and pronounced services.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:56.380
And it is a, I think it could be used for more than web stuff.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:04.600
And it was for removing some of the web.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:10.280
Like your database and your cache and all sorts of stuff to an application.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.280
typically a web application.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.120
Typically a web application.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.740
But I think it could really be anything.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.980
But it's a flexible service locator.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.500
And one of the reasons why I haven't covered it yet on Python bytes.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.440
I don't think I have is because I didn't quite understand what it was doing.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.200
And it took me a while to get my head around it.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.520
But it's pretty cool.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:38.480
And Hinnick apparently realizes that it is a bit difficult to get your head around what

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.200
this is doing.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.240
So he just recently released a video describing this project.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:55.360
So really great video describing services, what you can do with it, and also how to pronounce

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:55.760
his name.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.560
He doesn't pronounce his last name, though.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.680
Apparently that's left for maybe episode two.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.000
But I love, I guess.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.240
Anyway, it's pretty cool.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.840
Actually, I'm pretty excited about it after watching it, watching the video.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:20.260
I thought maybe it wouldn't be for me, but especially for keeping services contained or the setting

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:27.440
up services, looking them up within different parts of your application, and then getting them

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.200
all cleaned up correctly at the end.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.820
That's kind of what it does, plus a whole bunch of other stuff.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.920
And one of the neat things is throughout all of this documentation, the documentation is

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.280
amazing.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:45.580
Throughout all the documentation, he has examples in AIo HTTP, FastAPI, Flask, Pyramid, and Starlet.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.640
Nice.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.620
So the video is talking about Flask, but it's cool that he just already hit all the bases.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.960
Like, how do I do this in Starlet?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.860
Well, it's just a little different.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:03.200
Most of them, mostly they're similar, but little different ways to use it throughout the different

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.800
applications.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.200
So it's pretty cool.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:12.820
He also mentions in the video that he took a really long time really talking about the

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.440
terminology and the glossary of the documentation.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:22.760
And actually, I really appreciate this of somebody saying, okay, this is generally what I think

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.980
of is what the meanings for all of these words are.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:33.000
And it's a lot of these words are, they're overused in the English language to begin with.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.440
And even in talking about programming, web programming, but things like what is the service?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.480
What is a resource?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.880
What is a dependency?

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.480
Service layer.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.560
He goes through a whole bunch of different terms, what it means to him and probably to

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.220
everybody else.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.420
But if you're unfamiliar with them, and even a decent discussion of dependency injection.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:58.920
So one of the things he talks about is that this is not really a dependency injection

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.340
thing.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.580
It's inversion of control, but it's a little different than service.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.500
Service locators are a little different than dependency injection.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.360
And I kind of appreciate that discussion.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.020
It's pretty cool.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:15.880
So anyway, kudos to Hinnick for doing this and for helping us pronounce his name.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.320
Yeah, this looks cool.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.580
I definitely want to check this out.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.140
It's news to me, so I will be checking out.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.340
Cool.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.800
We have new leaders, Brian.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.460
We do.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.400
Yes.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.520
For the Python world, we have new leaders.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.500
And specifically, the steering council election results are in for next year.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.780
Okay.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:47.040
So for the 2024 term, we have Pablo Galindo Salgado.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.620
We've got Gregory Smith, Emily Morehouse, Barry Warsaw, and Thomas Werther's orders.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.140
So very cool to see them all leading the way.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.240
There's a lot of familiar faces there.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.180
So that's.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.640
That's pretty cool.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.940
I don't expect a whole lot of different from the year before, but here's the results.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:18.160
You can actually see in PEP 8105, you see everybody who was potentially a candidate, how many votes they got by people who are disenfranchised.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.960
I don't know what that means.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:25.700
Or the not the franchised voters, the one who are enfranchised, how many votes that they got.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.060
And you can put that all together.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.760
So this begs the question, like, well, how do you get on this list?

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.380
You get on this list by being nominated by a core developer.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.820
So everyone on the list was nominated by a core developer.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.600
If you are a core developer, you can nominate yourself.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.660
So that could be the person you see here, because everyone I see, I think, is a core developer.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.220
Okay.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.020
But anyway, the results, the results are in.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.520
And we have those five folks.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.180
Welcome and congrats.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:56.620
Awesome.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.000
Nice.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.680
That's a good set of names, too.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.520
Yeah.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.280
So.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.200
Yeah.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:04.900
All right.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.900
Indeed.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:12.840
Well, there probably is some protocol around the election results, right?

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:19.760
No, you could model it with classes, or you could functionally model it, like, in an immutable way, but I don't know about a protocol.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.320
Okay.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.580
We're just great at transitions on this podcast.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.600
The next, I want to talk about Python protocols.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:39.880
So there's an article from Carlos Vecina, I think, called Python protocols, defining a protocol and when to use it.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:47.340
And actually, this is something that I have, I've been meaning to play with for actually some years, and I haven't really done much with it yet.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.800
So I really appreciate this article.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:56.220
He's talking about protocols are a feature of Python that were added in Python 3.8.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.800
So really anything maintainable right now can use protocols.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:12.860
But they're, and you kind of, they're, mentally, I think of them kind of like class inheritance or mix-ins or abstract-based classes.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:22.040
And that's one of the things he talks about in this article is, is they are in that same similar space, but you use them a little different.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.980
And you might use them together with other forms too, like with mix-ins and abstract-based classes.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:41.540
So the article just goes through on how to define a protocol and really, and he's also discussed, also a decent tutorial on abstract-based classes and mix-ins as well, which is nice to kind of describe them all together.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.000
But the protocol thing is just sort of, let me see if I can find an example.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:58.240
So you inherit, you have a class that's inherited from protocol and you give it, you kind of give it function definitions, but don't fill in the body.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.340
So that's kind of what a protocol is.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:12.220
And then other classes that use the protocol derive from that, you know, from that protocol, from like in his example, there's a class called,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.340
explainable, that something that has an explain function.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:24.540
And so you would derive from explainable and then your new class would have, would, would be a instances of protocol.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:34.840
But all it really says is that you can, other places that use it for types and stuff can declare that they need some, need a protocol passed in or a explainable class.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.980
And then you can use anything that derives from that.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.400
So pretty cool.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.940
Yeah.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.280
Brian, let me jump in and just say one extra point.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:48.060
Brian, let me jump in and say, hey, what's awesome about this stuff is we've had duck typing like this.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.880
There's an assess fairness function that it has to call explain on the object passed in.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:59.780
And duck typing said, well, if it takes that, if you can pass it in there and it will run when you call explain on it, it must fit.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.100
Right.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.340
But the typing tools don't check.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.920
So like PyCharm, for example, would just go, well, it's a whatever.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.980
So good luck with that.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:20.700
But once you do this protocol stuff, if you say the function takes an explainable and you have explainable as a protocol, you can pass stuff in and it doesn't even have to derive from or be related to that protocol in a base class.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:28.680
Like anything that is passed in there, the type system will look at it and verify it hasn't explained, even if it's in a third party package and you don't control it.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:34.820
So it's like a way to project typing structure onto a dynamic thing that is not necessarily your code.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.280
It's wild.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.220
Oh, cool.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.280
I kind of had that a little bit wrong then.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.100
Awesome.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.200
You can drive from it.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.560
It gives you more information potentially.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.980
But it doesn't have to be.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.140
You don't even have to, which that's the totally wild aspect.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.000
That's what I think is really different for this.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.460
Okay.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.320
Yeah.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.420
Oh, awesome.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.000
That's pretty cool.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.100
No.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.640
Yeah.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:04.520
So clearly I haven't thoroughly read this article, but I do want to get into really getting my head around abstract based classes, mix ins and protocols and stuff.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:12.780
And I would say that though, because like your experiences in C++, mine also is in C++ and C# and all of those languages have these interface ideas.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.020
But they're put into the type system through inheritance.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.660
And so you can inherit from it and it does what you expect.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.680
And it seems the right thing.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.700
But what's weird is you don't even have to.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.920
That's what's weird about it.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.800
Okay.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.060
Cool.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.960
Oh, awesome.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.720
Now I definitely want to play with it more.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.960
Yeah.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.200
Because I've kind of missed that aspect of C++ in Python.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.520
Yeah.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.500
So nice.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.240
Anyway.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:43.960
Also, I'm assuming it's an AI generated image, but really cool image at the top of the article.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.680
I'm not sure what my opinion is about it.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.560
I'll ask GPT how I feel about it.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.100
It's hard to describe how I feel.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.380
So I'll, you know.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.180
Yeah.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:18:04.180
I'm actually sort of, I don't know, this is a tangent, but I've switched to, I was playing with like Bing as my primary search engine at work.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:08.840
I just, I don't know, a new computer, it just was there and I'm just going with it for a while.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.240
But everything I search is like, it gives me an AI generated answer first.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.740
And I'm like, I don't know if I like that very much.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.720
Yeah, I know.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.900
I know.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.680
Anyway.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.480
Well, that's it for our main stuff.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.460
Do you have any extras?

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.060
I could have almost made it an extra, extra, extra this time.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.820
So yeah, sure I do.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:34.500
First of all, I've been wanting to say this several times and I'm usually like looking at my screen and see what I want to share and stuff.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.700
And I didn't have this anywhere.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.120
So I just pulled up Mastodon to remind me.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:43.040
There are tons of people interacting with us over on Mastodon and I've had some great conversations.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.440
And I want to, I'm sure you do too, Brian, want to follow people back.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:53.860
So there's, there's kind of a, at least for, I'll say these are Michael's Mastodon's conventions.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.400
You, you could take them for what you want.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.540
I just made them up, but this is how I think about it.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.220
So people will follow me and I'm like, huh, did that person follow me?

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.820
Cause they listened to the show and listened to Brian say, you should come join us and have a conversation.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.160
Hey, I'd like to follow that person.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.840
But a lot of times they have no picture, no description, no web pages, no posts.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.700
You're like, yeah, maybe not next, you know?

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:19.460
And so I'm just going to say, if you have a picture and a description, a description seems

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:19.980
somewhat relevant.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.520
I will certainly follow you back.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.620
If you have posts, that's plus one.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.920
If you have a verified webpage, which is easy, another plus one.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.040
And a lot of people have private accounts who follow me.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.120
I'm like, why are you in social media?

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.560
If you want a private account, I don't understand what this is because your profile is public.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.840
Just your posts are private, but the platform has a way to have private posts.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.580
I don't understand.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.260
So anyway, probably not going to get a lot of engagement.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.940
If you have a private account, just post private messages for things you don't want to see.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.880
So, and while I'm on the topic of Mastodon, I had a really nice and productive conversation

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.200
with the PSF around my mask rant on PyCon.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.520
So that was nice over there.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.400
Some people weren't nice as they sent me, like not necessarily nice responses, but the PSF did.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:05.920
And that was cool.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.940
That's nice.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.740
Yeah.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.180
All right.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.000
Next one.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.320
Oh, wait, before you move on.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.580
I just want to add my two cents on the, the picture.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:21.240
Um, I also prefer to be able to see who it is, but also primarily if the picture is something

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.620
that they're using on other stuff.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.800
So like if a lot of people have a, their profile picture on their, like the profile picture

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:34.520
on their blog and on their, and in their primarily a GitHub user and, and they have the

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.820
same profile there, even if it's like a stylized something, but if it's the, if it's distinctive

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:45.840
and the same everywhere, like glyph, for instance, has a, has a, a different thing for them.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.920
I I'm okay with that, but most people I think go with their picture.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.960
I think it's the right answer.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.920
Yeah.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.680
When I say picture, I don't mean necessarily it has to be your picture.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.880
Just the fact that it's not the default icon.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.620
You've taken enough effort to put in something, even if it's just a picture of a triangle, I

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:01.940
don't care.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:02.260
You know?

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.500
Yeah.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.580
All right.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.600
Uh, Paul is asking in the audience, what is your secret?

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.600
Okay.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.060
Well, we'll do this.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:19.360
Um, we, earlier on, we were talking about how Michael's got a faster internet now, so we

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.460
should make it really fast speed.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:27.620
Um, and then somebody commented, wagrants, wagrants, commented, I played it at one and a half

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.240
times speed.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.420
Then I got up to a live event.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.800
Uh, and all of a sudden Brian should sounded like he got drunk in one second.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.320
Um, and so I said, Brian's secret is out.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.120
So nice.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.360
I'll just have another drink in my, Irish coffee.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.400
It's coffee.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.360
Trust me.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.120
Oh, all right.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.520
Uh, more extras.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:57.760
So, Dropbox spooks users with turning on new AI features that can almost automatically

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.380
send your private documents to open AI.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.780
Now you have to interact with part of the site for it to happen, but it doesn't say, Hey,

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.180
necessarily, cause you does, you touch this.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.440
We're now sending your social security number away.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.320
Um, but anyway, that's kind of.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.360
Well, I mean, yeah.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:22.660
So you can check that out on defaulted on if you're not subject to the GDPR, but defaulted

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.120
to off if you are.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.980
So, you know, plus one for GDPR there, I suppose.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.820
So mine was turned on.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:29.900
Okay.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.880
So you have to go check to make sure that they're not sharing all of your.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.060
Yes, exactly.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.480
And it's on by default for you, Brian.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.900
So you might want to check.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.000
The whole conversation it's on ours.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.680
The, the, the comment section of our second is like the top notch place for comments, I

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:46.880
think.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.980
So really good.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.220
Okay.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.360
Yeah.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.720
There's, it talks about how to go find it.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.700
So anyway, this like made me think, you know what?

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.860
I should really be a little more.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.220
I have, I have like three terabytes of data and Dropbox.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.780
So I'm like, maybe I should be a little more specific and intentional about where I put

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.080
my stuff.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.700
So I went on this, this right on Mastodon, by the way, a bunch of people sent me all sorts

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.340
of options of like, okay, if not Dropbox, then what?

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:14.660
And I decided whatever I'm doing is probably good to have it end to end encrypted.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.460
Cause then I don't care what they try to do with it.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:16.720
Right.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.860
Cause they can't decrypt it.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.380
Yeah.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.380
That, that solves a whole lot of problems.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.480
I don't, you care about the security, but it doesn't matter as much as if you're just

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.260
exposing files or leaking stuff or whatever.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:27.560
Right.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:32.720
So I decided to go, I already have a, a paid Proton account.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.500
So all my private stuff, all my private documents and like my scans of things I want to save that

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.300
might be sensitive.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:44.580
They're going to Proton drive where I have 500 gigs and it's already paid for and

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.040
encrypted.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.760
There's async thing you can install.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.600
That's pretty excellent.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.220
I looked around and some people suggested next cloud, which is really interesting.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.600
It's maybe more than I want.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.260
It's almost like a document calendar, everything self-hosted.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.460
Maybe do that next.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.640
Yeah.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:08.060
Own cloud got like super owned just last week and is a similar self-hosted thing, which

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.680
makes me a little nervous to self-host stuff.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.720
I know there are people host it for you, but it's not next cloud.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.060
It's a little bit indirect.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.280
So maybe violin.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:23.120
I don't know if you've heard of this, but they have encrypted, cloud storage and

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.000
the end again, pretty nice.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.140
I think this is, is it British?

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.540
I don't, I don't remember exactly.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.680
UG.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.020
Not sure.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:36.400
Uh, but somewhere in Europe, this company, it looks pretty good.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.340
I have not tried it, but, and, and encrypted there's ice drive, the next generation cloud

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:41.640
storage.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.420
Also, I think this might be the British one.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.020
Yeah.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.740
This isn't Wales.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.000
Um, I mean, British, I mean, UK.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.600
Sorry folks.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.560
So that's pretty interesting.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.700
And I think, I think I'm going to go with sync.com.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.720
Super simple.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.260
All they do is sync and then encrypted for six terabytes.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:04.640
It's like 140 bucks a year or something like that, which is a lot, you know, versus 240 for

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.640
less than that in Dropbox.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.400
Anyway, if people are in this zone of like, I'm looking for all this stuff.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.940
Oh my gosh, like, what am I going to do regardless of whether you care about the Dropbox fiasco?

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.940
Here's a bunch of options.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.900
Can people can pick?

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.280
There was one comment in this whole discussion that was pretty interesting.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.540
I think it was in the ours, just ours technica thing.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:30.180
And it said, look, if you give your data unencrypted to somebody, another company, even if you trust

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:34.480
them, you don't really necessarily control that anymore, especially if they decide to pass

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:34.920
it along.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.800
So, somebody pointed out cryptometer.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.540
Have you heard of this, Brian?

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.180
No.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.580
So cryptometer is cool.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:47.100
I have used something like it, but it's older and no longer supported, which makes me sad.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.500
So what you do is you run this app.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.880
It does like super strong encryption.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.560
You control the key, right?

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.680
It's just like a thing you make up and don't give away.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:04.080
And then it will create a drive, a mountable drive on your Mac or on windows, like a D driver,

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.120
E drive or whatever.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.220
And that thing is encrypted.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.360
So when you mount it with this software, it looks like a drive, but then when you unmount

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.180
it, it becomes just an encrypted pile of files.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:17.640
So you put that in Dropbox, you put that in sync or whatever, and then no matter what happens,

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.000
they just get an encrypted blob of stuff.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.200
So things I super care about, I have encrypted in something either cryptometer or something like it.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.900
On top of all the safety around the cloud drive and trust and whatever you might have there, like worst case scenario,

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.520
they get a huge, hard, hard to decrypt a blob of stuff that they don't know the value of.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.860
And I don't know if it has Linux.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.140
Someone's asking does it have Linux.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.380
I think it might.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.180
Let's see.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.100
Mac.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.920
No, let's see if I go to download what it says.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.060
Yeah.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.340
For people with downloads.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.380
Use your DMG.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.220
Yeah.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.820
Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS even.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:01.580
Yeah.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.920
So that's that.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.880
I think that it's a loss.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.020
I mean, cool.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:13.580
But cryptometer would have been great as a rotten tomato sort of thing to rate different cryptocurrencies.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.180
I know.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.400
The word is taken.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.600
I'm pretty sure this has been around before crypto became a thing.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.260
I'm not sure how old this is.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.500
Yeah.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:31.520
There's 17 pages of releases on GitHub from 2017.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.980
So yeah, they were ahead of their time in that.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.900
But yeah, this is super cool, Brian.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.700
Like you can just say, I don't really care that much about the security of where these files go.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.220
You're not getting them.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.740
Interesting.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.380
So I suggest a sweet combination of these things.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.100
I'm going through like a super digital decluttering as part of this.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.980
And it's glorious.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.140
I'm having like a tech love affair with Notion.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:55.800
It's so good.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.540
But yeah, anyway, I'll leave it there.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.120
Maybe I'll come back and tell you more about this.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:08.880
Last thing for me, I'm doing the keynote at PyCon Philippines 2024 in February.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.980
How awesome is that?

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.860
Slightly jealous, man.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.100
Somewhere I scroll down and over.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:14.720
Woo.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.560
Yeah.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.640
Cool.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.620
Three of us and I get to be one of them.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.200
So that'll be awesome.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.400
Thank you for inviting me.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.180
And if you're going to be there, I will see you there.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:22.840
Nice.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.660
Yeah.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.140
In February.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.300
Cool.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.000
Oops.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.300
What were you for your extras?

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.020
Well, I just deleted one.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.180
So sorry about that.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.520
But shift command T.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.060
Oh, shift commit.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.980
Oh, whatever.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.700
I'll just tell you guys about it.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:50.040
So this is the kind of time of year that some people like to donate some money to different

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.980
people, different groups.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.960
I had the link up for the Python Software Foundation.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.360
So Python Software Foundation is not hard to find.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.780
So I would encourage people to consider giving some money to the PSF.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.020
So Django Software Foundation is doing a drive.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.960
So giving some money.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.180
If you use Django, of course.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.780
If you enjoy Python Bytes, of course, you can check out Patreon.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:23.820
At Patreon, we do accept money for Python Bytes to help keep the show going.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.480
This is great.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:32.100
Also, I wanted to highlight as well just the idea that to just go on GitHub.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.640
So the different things you use on GitHub, like adders, for instance, you can go down and

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.140
you can sponsor this project.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.300
You can throw some money that way.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.840
pytest has a sponsor link.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:52.480
Pallets and Flask has a way to sponsor either all of Pallets or particular projects within

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.600
the Pallets program.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:02.680
And really, a lot of projects that you use every day have a sponsor of this project on GitHub.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.740
So I think it'd be great, too, for people.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.400
If you have extra and you want to help out, I think it's a good idea.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.320
Sometimes I help out different projects and I kind of shift it up every year and local

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.800
things.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.740
And I think the things that I use.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:24.280
And somebody asked me once recently about some projects don't really need the money.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:31.020
And I guess, for instance, I really love having people support Python Bytes through Patreon.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.980
It's fun to have our community help support us.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:38.740
If you, in particular, don't donate, we're not going to disappear.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.720
Michael and I are going to keep doing it anyway.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.600
It is totally up to you.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.340
And definitely don't do it if it's a hardship.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:49.200
But I think it's a fun thing to do this time of year is to spread the love around.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.620
That's all I wanted to say.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:55.660
Indeed, I second that as well.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.540
That's kind of serious, though.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.020
Do you have something funny for us?

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.080
Let's lighten it up.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.180
No, this is not funny.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.620
This is too close to home.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.580
You tell me how you feel about this.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.400
So here's the joke.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.320
Here's the joke.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.960
So there's two red buttons.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.980
Think Ren and Stimpy or something like that.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.420
And a huge, scary red button.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.580
You can press either of them.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.580
One of them says, pay $12.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.640
The other one says, admit to yourself, your dream is dead.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.960
There's somebody sweating trying to decide which button to press.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.600
And it's the domain renewal.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.900
Oh, yeah.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.520
Totally.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:40.220
This is way too close for home to home for me because I just transferred 25 domains from all the different places into hovers I talked about like a while ago.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.860
And I talked about all the name servers and all that.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:47.420
And there was a few where I'm like, God, is the dream dead or do I just move this?

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.720
So how many are you using still out of those?

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:55.960
Well, lots of them are to like protect people from doing crappy stuff.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.780
For example, I've talked by thon.com.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.920
I don't technically use it.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.840
It redirects to talk by thon.fm.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.280
But if I don't have it, someone will get it.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.760
And then all sorts of badness.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.320
Like there's a bunch of these cards.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.060
I would say half of them fall into that realm.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:10.560
Okay.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.900
And then maybe another third I'm directly using.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.360
And then there's the whatever the balance, the one six that's left is the dream could be dead.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.460
Or it could be not there yet.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.140
Not realized yet.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:22.460
We'll see.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:27.480
I had about eight that I was not really using last year.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:35.640
And I admitted that about half of those are not going to go anywhere and let them expire.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.120
Let them go.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.340
Although, I mean, the domain companies don't make it easy.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.880
You're like, okay, I'm just going to let it expire.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.060
But you get like emails.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.720
No, it's going to go.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.780
Oh, it's gone.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.780
But we're going to save it for you for a couple more months.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.460
And you get a whole bunch of guilt emails.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.560
But yeah.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.480
Anyway.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.060
Yeah.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:54.860
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.320
I have one real quick sad story to round this out, Brian.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.000
Okay.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.700
A friend of mine and I decided we're going to write some iPhone apps right when the iPhone came out.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.560
Like 2007 or whatever it was.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.360
And he had the clever idea of like, let's get a domain.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.400
I probably did it together.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:10.820
I don't know.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.800
Got the domain iPhone.ly.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.460
And we worked on stuff for like a year.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.040
Because we didn't know we're going to build.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:21.860
We'll just come up with this.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.720
We'll put stuff there.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.520
Never really came up with stuff.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.020
It looked like there was nothing on the horizon.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.480
We're like, you know, after three years, the LY, it was like the FM.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.520
It was like kind of expensive.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.600
Like, ah, just let it go.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.200
A week later, somebody says, hey, I'll give you $5,000 for that domain.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.680
So I shoot my friend like, hey, don't let it expire yet.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.280
Let's do this instead.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.960
He's like, it expired last week.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.620
Like, no.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.500
Oh, no.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:46.500
Oh, well.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.380
So it goes.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.760
So somebody could have paid you $5,000, but they instead got it for like $20.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.480
Yeah, for like $20 or something.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.800
I'm sorry to laugh at your pain.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.160
No, it's okay.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.120
I mean, like, I'm telling you, this is not a joke.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.120
Admit to yourself your dream is dead or pay $12 for the rest of your life every year.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.200
That's where you are.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.600
No, it's good.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.220
It's a good joke.

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.260
And people can hopefully laugh at it.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:11.660
Yeah.

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:15.780
Everybody, most people that listen to this podcast probably are feeling this.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.620
Yeah.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.960
All right.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.400
All right.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.340
Well, I'm feeling good about our year's worth of show every day.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.640
Yeah.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.480
365.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.540
Pretty cool.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:24.880
Yeah.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.880
All right.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.960
Talk to you later.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.800
Yeah.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.220
See you.
