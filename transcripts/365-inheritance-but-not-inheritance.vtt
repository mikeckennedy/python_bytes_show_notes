00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.960
This is episode 365. Wow.


00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.920
It's like we've been doing it for a year.


00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.500
Yeah. Recorded December 19th, 2023.


00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.520
Yeah, and I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.200
Hey, I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:32.660
And yeah, if we did it, if somebody listened to one a day from now on, they would be behind because we'll be way ahead of 365 by the time they finish.


00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.280
Still be awesome.


00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.500
Well, want to kick us off with something cool?


00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.820
Oh, before we kick it off.


00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.680
Yeah, go ahead.


00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.240
Let's say that this episode is sponsored by us.


00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.260
So please support us and other people.


00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.180
I'm going to talk about that a little.


00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.440
A little bit later at the end of the show.


00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.200
But also check out all the courses that Talk Python Training.


00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.040
Check out the complete pytest course.


00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.680
You can be a Patreon supporter.


00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.980
And also, if you want to connect with us, one of the best ways to do it is through on Mastodon.


00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:14.580
And we're all on Fosstodon, or at least Michael and I are@mkennedy at Brian Okken and at Python Bytes.


00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.960
Indeed.


00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.820
Hey, do I feel like I'm really fast, Brian?


00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.160
Like.


00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.340
Neo in the matrix.


00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.220
Mind-bendingly fast.


00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.520
Let's go with yes.


00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.440
Okay.


00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.560
I appreciate that.


00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.080
Because this, I just got fiber and gigabit fiber installed 30 minutes ago.


00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.220
I was hoping it wouldn't destroy the show, but it almost, almost didn't make it, but it made it.


00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.360
Ooh, nice.


00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.740
So hopefully that doesn't curse it, that something doesn't go wrong and it will crash.


00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.620
But 950 megabit down, which is fine, but 950 megabit up is glorious.


00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.060
We should like.


00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.240
Sorry.


00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.140
We should speed up.


00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.540
We should speed up the playback speed when we release the MP3.


00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.620
So it sounds really fast.


00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.840
No, we're talking really fast because it's really uploading.


00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.100
Yeah.


00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.800
No, let's, let's talk about, let's talk about Hatch because Hatch is awesome.


00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:10.460
Ofec is the maintainer creator of Hatch and boy, oh boy, has he gone big on his latest release 1.8.0.


00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:19.220
So Hatch is like Flit, is like PDM, is like Pip, ENV, and many of these other poetry.


00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.740
Others, if I'm leaving here.


00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.720
I'm going to have to get another version of this out.


00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.220
I apologize.


00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.500
But with version 1.8, this has gone in a bit of a different direction.


00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.800
Now I had Ofec on, on the Python packaging panel.


00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.240
I think Steve Dower was there.


00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.240
Some other folks were there.


00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:50.380
Really interesting that there's this tension between should there be an app that manages Python environments with Python?


00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.700
Or should there be a third party?


00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.640
Or should there be a thing that manages the Python itself?


00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.560
Right.


00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.320
Kind of like Pi EMV, for example.


00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.160
Right.


00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.020
So Hatch has gone in that direction of now Hatch manages Python, not just Python projects.


00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.020
And there's this thing to solve this problem in the form of Pi app.


00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.320
So Pi app is even maybe more awesome.


00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.480
Pi app is a runtime installer for Python projects written in Rust.


00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.220
And they can be, you ready for this?


00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.820
I'm so, so excited.


00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:33.080
Your Python app can be distributed as a standalone executable, a dot exe or a dot app for users.


00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.140
What do you think, Brian?


00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.720
I'm very interested in finding out more.


00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.240
Now this whole post is a little bit wordy.


00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.120
So let me jump into the Omnivore version of it over here, which has a huge icon.


00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.720
So Ofec says, look, one of the things has been a perpetual problem for Hatch and all the others I named is that it's not working.


00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.240
It's not working.


00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.440
It's not working.


00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.480
It's not working.


00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.700
It's not working.


00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.160
Python itself is a dependency.


00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.680
So in order to use Hatch or any of these other tools or any apps, you have to say, well, go get Python and then get back to me and we'll start talking.


00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.940
Right.


00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.540
So he came up with this thing called Pi app that will create installers for the different platforms.


00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.660
Claims it's trivial.


00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.520
It's probably never trivial, but possible.


00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.260
Possible would be awesome even.


00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.400
And so starting with this releases, not only are the binaries available for every platform.


00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:29.680
But there are installers as in like install wizards on Windows and a DMG type thing, I'm guessing, or a PKG on macOS.


00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.560
That's awesome.


00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.480
If you have ever in the recent days, try to put something onto macOS or Windows.


00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.260
There's a whole nightmare of digitally signing around it, Brian.


00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.220
So you can't just get a binary and give it to somebody that the platforms will freak out.


00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.340
They won't let you open it.


00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.300
Like macOS will not let you open it unless you go into settings and say, allow me to run apps from untrusted developers.


00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.980
And Windows gives you this big, scary doll dialogue and tries to not run it.


00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.440
So that's why this is not developers that you don't trust.


00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.480
It's developers that Apple doesn't trust.


00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.600
Yes, exactly.


00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.040
You may or may not trust them, but that's a different conversation.


00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.620
It's a fair feature, but it makes creating desktop distributor apps super painful.


00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.080
So check this out.


00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.160
Halfway there.


00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.660
The installer for macOS is signed using a certificate.


00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.820
So your apps built with this are already trusted.


00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.980
Honestly, I don't know how this is possible.


00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.860
I mean, I know why, how it works.


00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.140
I'm not sure how it's allowed, but I'm all for it.


00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:48.420
Because I have dealt with Apple, and they are not lenient in any way, shape, or form when it comes to stuff running on their platform.


00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.280
But so the installer for the macOS is signed using a certificate.


00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.920
So the macOS is signed using a certificate from the same account used to sign the official distributions of Python.


00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.200
So you won't get any security warnings or blocking.


00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.280
Thank you, E. Durbin, for helping out with that.


00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.060
And Hatch itself, with any good system, is self-updating.


00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.720
So you can Hatch self-update.


00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.980
What else I want to point out?


00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.820
There's also a new Python, like Hatch Python command group that will allow you to manage things.


00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.220
So you can show what you have installed.


00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.260
You can install different versions of Python.


00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.240
See Python.


00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.880
There's Python and PyPy for those.


00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.220
It works with virtual environments.


00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.100
It has built-in rough and rough format integrations.


00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:44.660
And traditionally, it's been somewhat slow to activate and set up a virtual environment that's already previously been installed because it will refresh and recheck that all of the dependencies are there and everything.


00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.940
So now it does a hash of those.


00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.200
And so only if the dependency statement doesn't work, does it.


00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.040
So it doesn't match the hash, right, basically.


00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.260
So it'll pre-compute all that stuff.


00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.240
So now it should be basically instant.


00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.200
So also some minor breaking changes around build defaults.


00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.760
And the new app build target is what I've been raving about.


00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.640
So, Ophac, you killed it.


00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.400
I can't believe it.


00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.800
It's awesome.


00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.420
Awesome.


00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.940
So Hatch has hashes?


00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:20.180
If you hash a Hatch with hashling and, you know, like there's some kind of tongue twister in there.


00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.880
I'm not doing it, though.


00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.260
I'm excited about this.


00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.400
It's very cool.


00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.100
I definitely want to play with it.


00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.760
Yeah.


00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.240
Yes, indeed.


00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.840
What about you?


00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.920
All right.


00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:48.860
Well, I'm not sure how long this has been out, but Hinnick has been promoting a new project that he's got called Services or SVCS, which is short for services and pronounced services.


00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.140
And it.


00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.980
Is a.


00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.340
I think it could be used for more than web stuff.


00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:12.260
But the the intent, I think, was for removing some of the border plate code from hooking up dependencies and different like like your database and your cache and all sorts of stuff to an application, typically a web application.


00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.840
But I think it could really be anything.


00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.140
But it's a flexible service locator.


00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.100
And one of the reasons why I.


00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.540
Haven't covered it yet on Python Bytes.


00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:29.280
I don't think I have is because I didn't quite understand what it was doing and it took me a while to get my head around it.


00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:29.820
Why does this exist?


00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.520
But it's it's pretty cool.


00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:39.200
And Hinnick apparently realizes that it is a bit difficult to get your head around what this is doing.


00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.360
So he he just recently released a video describing this this project.


00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.380
So really great.


00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:55.820
Great, great video describing services, what you can do with it and also how to pronounce his name.


00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.580
He doesn't pronounce his last name, though.


00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.680
Apparently that's left for maybe episode two.


00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.960
But I guess.


00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.240
Anyway, it's it's pretty cool.


00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.840
Actually, I'm pretty excited about it after after watching it, watching the video.


00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.800
I thought maybe it wouldn't be for me, but especially for keeping services contained.


00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.320
Or.


00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:29.200
For the setting up services, looking them up within different parts of your application and then and then getting them all cleaned up correctly at the end.


00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.840
That's kind of what it does, plus a whole bunch of other stuff.


00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.320
And one of the neat things is throughout all of this documentation, the documentation is amazing.


00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:45.600
Throughout all the documentation, he has examples in AIO, AIO, HTTP, FastAPI, Flask, Pyramid and Starlet.


00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.080
So nice.


00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.300
And some of the videos.


00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.380
Talking about Flask.


00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.620
But it's cool that he just already hit all the bases.


00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.960
Like, how do I do this in Starlet?


00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.860
Well, it's just a little different.


00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.500
Most of them.


00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:03.800
Mostly they're similar, but a little different ways to use it throughout the different applications.


00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.200
So it's pretty cool.


00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:15.280
He also mentions in the video that he took a really long time really talking about the terminology in the glossary of the documentation.


00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.300
And actually, I really appreciate this.


00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.200
Of somebody.


00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:27.120
Saying, okay, this is generally what I think of is what the the meanings for all of these words are.


00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:33.040
And it's a lot of these words are are they're overused in the English language to begin with.


00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.660
And even in talking about programming web programming.


00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.540
But things like what is the service?


00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.620
What is a resource?


00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.560
What is a dependency service layer?


00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:47.260
He goes through a whole bunch of different terms, what it means to him and probably to everybody else.


00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.180
But if you're unfamiliar with them.


00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.580
And even a decent discussion of dependency injection.


00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:59.420
So the one of the things he talks about is that this is not a not really a dependency injection thing.


00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.660
It's inversion of control, but it's a little different than service.


00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.740
Service locators are a little different than dependency injection.


00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.460
And I kind of appreciate that discussion.


00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.120
It's pretty cool.


00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.920
So anyway, kudos to Henick for doing this and for helping us pronounce his name.


00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.400
Yeah, this looks cool.


00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.240
I definitely want to check.


00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:19.740
This out.


00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.560
It's news to me.


00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.180
So I will be checking out.


00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.640
Cool.


00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.080
Mm hmm.


00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.660
We have new leaders.


00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.700
Brian, we do.


00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.480
Yes.


00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.680
For the Python world, we have new leaders.


00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.680
And specifically, the steering council election results are in for next year.


00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.980
Okay.


00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:49.220
So for the 2024 term, we have Pablo Galindo Salgado, we've got Gregory Smith, Emily.


00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.840
Morehouse, Barry Warsaw and Thomas Werther's orders.


00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.220
So very cool to see them all leading the way.


00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.340
There's a lot of familiar faces there.


00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.780
So that's pretty cool.


00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.780
I don't expect a whole lot of different from the year before.


00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.220
But here's the results you could actually see in Pep 8105.


00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:18.240
Let's see everybody who was potentially a candidate, how many votes they got by people who are disenfranchised.


00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.100
I don't know what that means.


00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:19.200
Yeah.


00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:29.200
So the number of votes that they got, or the not the franchise voters, the one or in franchise, how many votes that they got, and you can put that all together.


00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.200
So this begs the question like, well, how do you get on this list?


00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.200
You get on this list by being nominated by a core developer.


00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.200
So everyone on the list was nominated by a core developer.


00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.200
If you are a core not core developer, your core developer, you can nominate yourself.


00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.180
So that could be the person you see here, because everyone I see, I think is a core developer.


00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.180
So I think that's the way to go.


00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.180
Okay.


00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.180
But anyway, the results, the results are in and we have those five folks.


00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.180
Welcome and congrats.


00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.180
Awesome.


00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.180
Nice.


00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.180
That's a good set of names too.


00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.180
Yeah.


00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.180
So yeah.


00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.180
All right.


00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.180
Indeed.


00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:13.180
Well, there probably is some protocol around elect the election results, right?


00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.180
Now you could model it with classes, or you could functionally model it like in a immutable way.


00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.180
But I don't know about you.


00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.160
I don't know.


00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160
I don't know about a protocol.


00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160
Okay.


00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.160
We're just great at transitions on this podcast.


00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.160
The next I want to talk about Python protocols.


00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:40.160
So there's an article from Carlos Vecina, I think, called Python protocols, defining a protocol and when to use it.


00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:47.160
And actually, this is something that I have, I've been meaning to play with for actually some years, and I haven't really done much with it yet.


00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.140
So I really appreciate this article.


00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:56.140
He's talking about the protocols are a feature of Python that were added in Python three, eight.


00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:13.140
So really anything maintainable right now can use this can you can use protocols, but they're and you kind of they're in mentally I think of them kind of like, like class inheritance or mix ins or abstract base classes.


00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:19.120
And that's one of the things he talks about this in this article is, is they are in that same similar context.


00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.120
So you can use them in a similar space, but, but you use them a little different.


00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:28.120
And you might use them together with other with other forms to like with with mix ins and abstract base classes.


00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:42.120
So the article just goes through on how to define a protocol and really, and he's also discussed you also a decent tutorial on abstract base classes and mix ins as well, which is nice to kind of describe them all together.


00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:49.100
But the, the protocol thing is just sort of let's see if I find an example.


00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:58.100
So you inherit, you have a class that's inherited from protocol, and you give it, you kind of give it function definitions, but don't fill in the body.


00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.100
So that's kind of what a protocol is.


00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:15.100
And then other other classes that you that use the protocol derived from that, you know, from that protocol from like in his example, there's a class called explainable, that something that has an explained function.


00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.080
And so you would derive from explainable.


00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:24.080
And then your new class would have would would be a instances of protocol.


00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:37.080
But all it really says is that you can other places that use it for types and stuff can declare that they need some need a protocol passed in or a explainable class and then you can use anything that derives from that.


00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.080
So pretty cool.


00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.080
Yeah, Brian, let me jump in and say one extra point here.


00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.080
Like what's awesome about this stuff is we've had duck typing like this.


00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.060
There's an assess function.


00:15:49.060 --> 00:16:01.060
It's a fairness function that it has to call explain on the object passed in and duck typing said, Well, if it takes that if you can pass it in there and it will run when you call explain on it, it must fit right.


00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.060
But the typing tools don't check.


00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.060
So like pie charm, for example, would just go well, it's a whatever.


00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.060
So good luck with that.


00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:19.040
But once you do this protocol stuff, if you say the function takes an explainable and you have explainable as a protocol, you can pass stuff in and it doesn't even have to derive from or be related to.


00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.040
So it's like a way to project that protocol in a base class, like anything that is passed in there.


00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:29.040
The type system will look at it and verify it has an explain, even if it's in a third party package and you don't control it.


00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:35.040
So it's like a way to project typing structure onto a dynamic thing that is not necessarily your code.


00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.040
It's wild.


00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.040
Oh, cool.


00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.040
I kind of had that a little bit wrong then.


00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.040
Awesome.


00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.040
You can drive from it.


00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.040
It gives you more information potentially, but it doesn't have to be.


00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.040
You don't even have to, which that's the totally wild aspect.


00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.040
That's what I think is really different for this.


00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.020
Okay.


00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.020
Yeah.


00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.020
Oh, awesome.


00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.020
That's pretty cool.


00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.020
No.


00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.020
Yeah.


00:16:54.020 --> 00:17:04.020
So clearly I haven't thoroughly read this article, but I do want to get into really getting my head around abstract based classes, mixins and protocols and stuff.


00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.020
And partly.


00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:17.020
I would say that though, because like your experiences in C++, mine also is in C++ and C# and all of those languages have these interface ideas, but they're put into the type system through inheritance.


00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.000
And so you can inherit from it and it does work.


00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
So that's what you expect.


00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And it seems the right thing, but what's weird is you don't even have to.


00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
That's what's weird about it.


00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Okay.


00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Cool.


00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Oh, awesome.


00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Now I definitely want to play with it more.


00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Yeah.


00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Cause I've kind of missed that aspect of C++ in Python.


00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Yeah.


00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
So nice.


00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Anyway.


00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Also, I'm assuming it's a AI generated image, but really cool image at the top of the article.


00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
It is.


00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
I'm not sure what my opinion is about it.


00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.980
I'll ask ChatGPT how I feel about it.


00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.980
It's hard to describe how I feel.


00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.980
So I'll, you know, yeah, I'm actually sort of, I don't know.


00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:03.980
This is a tangent, but I've switched to was, was playing with like Bing is my primary search engine at work.


00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.980
I just, I don't know that a new computer, it just was there and I'm just going with it for awhile.


00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.980
But everything I search is like, gives me an AI generated answer first.


00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.980
And I'm like, I don't know if I like that very much.


00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:17.980
Yeah, I know.


00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:18.960
I know.


00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:25.360
anyway well that's uh that's it for our main stuff do you have any extras i could have almost


00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.500
made an extra extra extra this time so yeah sure i do first of all i've been wanting to say this


00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.620
several times and i'm usually like looking at my screen and see what i want to share and stuff and


00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.640
i didn't have this anywhere so i just pulled up mastodon to remind me there are tons of people


00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.580
interacting with us over on mastodon and i've had some great conversations and i want to i'm sure


00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:51.700
you do too brian want to follow people back but there's there's kind of a at least for i'll say


00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:56.780
these are michael's mastodons conventions uh you you could take them for what you want i just made


00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.800
them up but this is how i think about it so people will follow me and i'm like huh did that person


00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.100
follow me because they listen to the show and listen to brian say you should come join us and


00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.920
have a conversation hey i'd like to follow that person but a lot of times they have no picture


00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:14.560
no description no web pages no posts you're like uh yeah maybe not next you know and so


00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:14.560
you know i've been wanting to follow people back but there's there's a lot of people that


00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:14.560
follow me and i'm like oh my god i want to follow people back but there's a lot of people


00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:14.560
there's a lot of people that follow me and i'm like oh my god i want to follow people back


00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.980
i'm just gonna say if you have a picture and a description that description seems a lot relevant


00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.680
i will certainly follow you back if you have posts that's plus one if you have a verified


00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:31.060
web page which is easy another plus one and a lot of people have private accounts who follow me


00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.960
i'm like why are you in social media if you want a private account i don't understand what this is


00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:41.140
because your profile is public just your posts are private but the platform has a way to have


00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.540
private posts i don't understand so anyway um


00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:49.140
probably not going to get a lot of engagement if you have a private account just post private


00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:54.080
messages for things you don't want to see so and while i'm on the topic of massadon i had a really


00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:00.140
nice and productive conversation with the psf around my mask rant on pycon so that was nice


00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:05.200
over there some people weren't nice as they sent me like not necessarily nice responses but the psf


00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.960
did and that was cool that's nice yeah all right next one oh wait before you move on i just want to


00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.520
add my two cents on the uh yeah i do do the picture


00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:21.500
um i also prefer to be able to see who it is but also primarily if the picture is something that


00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:26.320
they're using on other stuff so like if a lot of people have their profile picture on their


00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:33.080
like the profile picture on their blog and on their um and they're primarily a github user and


00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.860
and they have the same profile there even if it's like a stylized something but if it's the


00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:44.500
if it's distinctive and the same everywhere like glyph for instance has a has a


00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.080
a different thing for them i i'm okay with that but most people i think go with their picture i


00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.320
think it's the right answer but yeah when i say picture i don't mean necessarily has to be your


00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.820
picture just the fact that it's not the default icon you've taken enough effort to put in


00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.160
something even if it's just a picture of a triangle i don't care you know


00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:08.580
yeah all right uh paul is asking in the audience what is your secret


00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:14.480
okay well we'll do this um we early


00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:20.000
on we were talking about how michael's got a faster internet now so we should make it


00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.280
really fast speed um and then somebody commented wagrant wagrants uh commented i played it at one


00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:33.920
and a half times speed then i got up to a live event uh and all of a sudden brian should sounded


00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:42.200
like he got drunk in one second um and so i said brian secret is out so nice i'll just have another


00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.360
drink of my uh irish coffee


00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:44.460
i'll just have another drink of my uh irish coffee


00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.140
it's coffee trust me


00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:55.100
all right uh more extras so um dropbox spooks users with turning on new ai features that


00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:01.980
can almost automatically send your private documents to open ai now you have to interact


00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.540
with part of the site for it to happen but it doesn't say hey necessarily because you just you


00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:14.440
touch this we're now sending your social security number away um but anyway that's kind of unnerving


00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:22.800
yeah so you can check that out on defaulted to on if you're not subject to the gdpr but defaulted to


00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:30.380
off if you are so you know plus one for gdpr there i suppose so mine was turned on okay so you have


00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.160
to go check to make sure that they're not sharing all of your yes exactly and it's on by default for


00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:42.980
you brian so you might want to check the whole conversation it's on ours the the comment section


00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:50.880
of our second is like the top notch place for comments i think so really good okay yeah it talks


00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.560
about how to go find it so anyway this like made me think you know what i should really be a little


00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.420
more i have like three terabytes of data in dropbox so i'm like maybe i should be a little more


00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:04.120
specific and intentional about where i put my stuff so i went on this this rant on mastodon


00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.340
by the way a bunch of people sent me all sorts of options of like okay if not dropbox then what


00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.560
and i decided whatever i'm doing is probably good to have it


00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:12.960
uh


00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.080
end to end encrypted because then i don't care what they try to do with it right because they


00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.040
can't decrypt it yeah that that solves a whole lot of problems i don't you care about the security


00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.560
but it doesn't matter as much as if you're just exposing files or leaking stuff or whatever right


00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:34.920
so i decided to go i already have a paid proton account so all my private stuff all my private


00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.440
documents and like my scans of things i want to save that might be sensitive they're going to


00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.940
proton drive where i have 500 gigs and


00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.580
it's already paid for and encrypted there's a sync thing you can install that's pretty excellent


00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:53.500
i looked around and some people suggested next cloud which is really interesting it's


00:23:53.500 --> 00:24:00.380
maybe more than i want it's almost like a document calendar everything self-hosted maybe do that next


00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:07.980
yeah own cloud got like super owned just last week and there's a similar self-hosted thing which


00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.140
makes me a little nervous to self-host stuff i know there are people host it for you but it's not


00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:12.920
next cloud it's a little bit different than what i'm used to but i'm going to do that next week and


00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:12.940
i'm going to do that next week and i'm going to do that next week and i'm going to do that next week


00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:21.400
a little bit indirect so maybe violin i don't know if you've heard of this um but they have encrypted


00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:28.520
uh cloud storage and the end again pretty nice i think this is a british i don't remember exactly


00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:37.720
ug not sure uh but somewhere in europe this company it looks pretty good i have not tried it


00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:42.520
but and encrypted there's ice drive the next generation cloud storage also i think this might


00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:42.900
be the best way to do it but i think it's going to be a good idea to do it next week and then we'll see


00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:42.920
but and encrypted there's ice drive the next generation cloud storage also i think this might


00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:42.920
be the best way to do it but i think it's going to be a good idea to do it next week and then we'll see


00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:49.560
one yeah this is in wales um i mean british i mean uk sorry folks so that's pretty interesting


00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:56.340
and i think i think i'm gonna go with sync.com super simple all they do is sync and then


00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:03.600
encrypted for six terabytes it's like 140 bucks a year or something like that which is a lot you


00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.360
know versus 240 for less than that in dropbox anyway if people are in this zone of like i'm


00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.880
looking for all this stuff oh my gosh like what am i gonna do regardless of whether you


00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:19.760
care about the dropbox fiasco here's a bunch of options people can pick there was one comment in


00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.940
this whole discussion that was pretty interesting i think it was in the ours just ours technica


00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:29.820
thing and it said look if you give your data unencrypted to somebody another company even if


00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.100
you trust them you don't really necessarily control that anymore especially if they decide


00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:40.220
to pass it along so uh somebody pointed out cryptomator have you heard of this brian no


00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.600
so cryptomator is cool


00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.880
i have used something like it but it's older and no longer supported which makes me sad so what you


00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:53.800
do is you run this app it does like super strong encryption you control the key right it's just


00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:59.860
like a thing you make up and don't give away and then it will create a drive a mountable drive


00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:06.800
on your mac or on windows like a d driver e drive or whatever and that thing is encrypted so when


00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.980
you mount it with this software it looks like a drive but then when you unmount it becomes just


00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.840
an encrypted pile of files so you can't do that with cryptomator you can't do that with cryptomator


00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:18.560
you put that in dropbox you put that in sync or whatever and then no matter what happens they just


00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:23.700
get an encrypted blob of stuff so things i super care about i have encrypted in something either


00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:30.040
cryptomator or something like it on top of all the safety around the cloud drive and trust and


00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.620
whatever you might have there like worst case scenario they get a huge hard hard to decrypt a


00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:40.420
blob of stuff that they don't know the value of and i don't know if it has linux someone's asking


00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.420
does this have linux uh


00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:47.100
i think it might let's see mac


00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:54.340
no let's see if i go to download what it says yeah it's worth knowing for people downloads


00:26:54.340 --> 00:27:04.100
use your dmg yeah windows mac linux android and ios even yeah so that's that i think that


00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:11.900
it's a loss i mean cool but cryptomator would have been great as a rotten tomato sort of thing to to


00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.840
from cryptocurrencies?


00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.680
- I know.


00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.780
It's, the word is taken.


00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.160
I'm pretty sure this has been around


00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.700
before crypto became a thing.


00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.280
Like I'm not sure how old this is, but, yeah.


00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.780
There's 17 pages of releases on GitHub from 2017.


00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.060
So yeah, they were ahead of their time in that,


00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.000
but this is super cool, Brian.


00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.840
Like you can just say,


00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.820
I don't really care that much about the security


00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.460
where these files go.


00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.720
You're not getting them.


00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.500
- Hmm, interesting.


00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.000
- So I suggest a sweet combination of these things.


00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.540
I'm going through like a super digital decluttering


00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.560
as part of this, and it's glorious.


00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.240
I'm having like a tech love affair with Notion.


00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.640
It's so good.


00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.700
But yeah, anyway, that's, I'll leave it there.


00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.240
Maybe we'll come back and tell you more about this.


00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.120
Last thing for me, I'm doing the keynote at PyCon,


00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.040
yes, at PyCon Philippines 2024 in February.


00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.320
How awesome is that?


00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.720
- Slightly jealous, man.


00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.400
- So we're right scroll down and over.


00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.500
Woo, yeah.


00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.340
- Cool.


00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.660
- Three of us, and I get to be one of them.


00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.500
So that'd be awesome.


00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.420
Thank you for inviting me.


00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.540
And if you're gonna be there, I will see you there.


00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.500
- Nice.


00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.160
- Yeah, in February.


00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.000
- Cool.


00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.340
- Oops, I just deleted.


00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.980
- Over to you for your extras.


00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.240
- Well, I just deleted one.


00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.680
So sorry about that, but.


00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.920
- Shift command T.


00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.500
- Shift, oh, shift commit, oh, whatever.


00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.540
I'll just tell you guys about it.


00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:46.540
So this is the kind of time of year


00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.740
that some people like to donate some money


00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.960
to different people, different groups.


00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.160
I had the link up for the Python Software Foundation.


00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.520
So Python Software Foundation is not hard to find.


00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.840
So I would encourage people to consider


00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.240
giving some money to the PSF.


00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.140
Also Django Software Foundation is doing a drive.


00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.060
So giving some money.


00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.360
If you use Django, of course.


00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.000
If you enjoy Python Bytes, of course,


00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.120
you can check out Patreon.


00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:22.800
Patreon, we do accept money for Python Bytes


00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.100
to help keep the show going.


00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.200
This is great.


00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.460
Also, I wanted to highlight as well,


00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.360
just the idea that to just go on GitHub.


00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.580
So the different things you use on GitHub,


00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.560
like adders, for instance, you can go down


00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.460
and you can sponsor this project.


00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.680
Throw some money that way.


00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.160
pytest has a sponsor link.


00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.060
Palettes and Flask has a way to sponsor


00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.140
either all of Palettes or particular projects


00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.020
within the Palettes program.


00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.640
And really a lot of projects that you use every day


00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.840
have a sponsor this project on GitHub.


00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.900
So I think it'd be great too for people,


00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.600
if you have extra and you want to help out,


00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.860
I think it's a good idea.


00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.020
I have, sometimes I help out different projects.


00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.940
And I kind of shift it up every year and local things.


00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.140
And I think the things that I use.


00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.080
And somebody asked me once recently about,


00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.740
like some projects don't really need the money.


00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.900
And I guess like, for instance,


00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.580
I really love having people support Python Bytes


00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.500
through Patreon.


00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.500
It's fun to have our community help support us.


00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.680
It's not, if you in particular don't donate,


00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.080
we're not going to disappear.


00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.840
Michael and I are going to keep doing it anyway.


00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.620
It is totally up to you.


00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.580
And definitely don't do it if it's a hardship.


00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.500
But I think it's a fun thing to do this time of year


00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.840
is to spread the love around.


00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.080
That's all I wanted to say.


00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.900
- Indeed, I second that as well.


00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.920
- That's kind of serious though.


00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.400
Do you have something funny for us?


00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.240
- Let's lighten it up.


00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.340
No, this is not funny.


00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.440
This is too, it's too close to home.


00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.620
You tell me how you feel about this.


00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.720
So here's the joke.


00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.780
Here's the joke.


00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.660
So there's two red buttons, think Ren and Stan.


00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.040
Stimpy or something like that.


00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.480
And a huge, scary red button.


00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.440
You can press either of them.


00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.220
One of them says, pay $12.


00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:21.900
The other one says, admit to yourself, your dream is dead.


00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.360
And the bottom, there's somebody sweating,


00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.440
trying to decide which button to press.


00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.560
And it's the domain renewal.


00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.880
- Oh yeah, totally.


00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.440
- This is a way too close for home to home for me


00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.980
because I just transferred 25 domains


00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.980
from all the different places into hovers.


00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.480
I talked about like a while ago.


00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.780
I talked about all the name servers and all that.


00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.140
And there was a few where I'm like,


00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.740
God, is the dream dead or do I just move this?


00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.840
- So how many are you using still out of those?


00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.860
- Well, lots of them are to like protect people


00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.080
from doing crappy stuff.


00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.400
For example, I have talkbython.com.


00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.280
I don't technically use it.


00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.460
It redirects to talkbython.fm.


00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.620
But if I don't have it, someone will get it.


00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.960
And then all sorts of badnesses.


00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.420
Like there's a bunch of these guard.


00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.300
I would say half of them fall into that realm.


00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.140
- Okay.


00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.960
- And then maybe another third I'm directly using.


00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.980
And then there's the, whatever the balance,


00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.860
the one sixth that's left is the dream could be dead.


00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.500
But it could be not there yet.


00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.340
Not realized yet.


00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.180
We'll see.


00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:27.580
- I had about eight that I was not really using last year.


00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:32.520
And I let, I admitted that about half of those


00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.740
are not gonna go anywhere and let them expire.


00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:36.580
- Let them go.


00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:40.120
- Although I mean, the domain companies don't make it easy.


00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.240
They're like, okay, I'm just gonna let it expire.


00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.660
But you get like emails.


00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.880
No, it's gonna go.


00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.940
Oh, it's gone.


00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.940
But we've just, we're gonna save it for you


00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.280
for a couple more months.


00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.640
And you get a whole bunch of guilt emails.


00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.940
But yeah, anyway.


00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.660
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.


00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.860
I have one real quick sad story to round this out, Brian.


00:32:58.860 --> 00:32:59.700
- Okay.


00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.540
- A friend of mine and I decided we're gonna write


00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.780
some iPhone apps right when the iPhone came out,


00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.840
like 2007 or whatever it was.


00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.500
And he had the clever idea of like, let's get a domain.


00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.000
I probably did it. - Yeah.


00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.840
- We did it together.


00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.660
I don't know.


00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.740
Got the domain, iPhone.ly, iPhone-ly.


00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.720
And we worked on stuff for like a year


00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.120
'cause we didn't know we're gonna build.


00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:21.960
We'll just like come up with this.


00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.980
We'll put stuff there.


00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.600
Never really came up with stuff.


00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.120
It looked like there was nothing on the horizon.


00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.860
We're like, you know, after three years, the L-Y,


00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:29.700
it was like the FM.


00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.660
It was like kind of expensive.


00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.200
Like, ah, just let it go.


00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.260
A week later, somebody says,


00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.580
"Hey, I'll give you $5,000 for that domain."


00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.880
So I shoot my friend like, "Hey, don't let it expire yet."


00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.380
"Let's do this instead."


00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.180
He's like, "It expired last week."


00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.020
Like, no.


00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:44.860
- Oh, no.


00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.500
- Oh, well, so it goes.


00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.900
- So that somebody could have paid you $5,000,


00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.000
but they instead got it for like 20 or--


00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.840
- They got it, yeah, for like 20 bucks or something.


00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.580
- I'm sorry to laugh at your pain.


00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.420
- No, it's okay.


00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.320
I mean, like, I'm telling you, this is not a joke.


00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.780
Admit to yourself your dream is dead


00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.640
or pay $12 for the rest of your life every year.


00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.480
That's where you are.


00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.960
No, it's good.


00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.760
It's a good joke.


00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.480
And hopefully you laugh at it.


00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.900
- Yeah, everybody, most people that listen to this podcast


00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.200
probably are feeling this.


00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.500
- Yeah, that's, all right.


00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.820
Well, I'm feeling good about our year's worth of show


00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.280
every day.


00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.760
- Yeah, 365, pretty cool.


00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.520
- Yeah, I know.


00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.680
- Talk to you later.


00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.620
- Yeah, see ya.
