00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.480
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.580
This is episode 408, recorded Monday, November 4th, 2024.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.520
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.580
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.360
And this episode is brought to you by Scout APM.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.520
You can get Python and Django application performance monitoring and Codeium, a free AI code completion and chat tool.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.340
That's pretty awesome.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.820
So be sure to check them out.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.840
We'll tell you more about both of them later.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.680
Links are in the show notes.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.000
You can connect with us on the socials.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800
Best place probably is Fostadon or Mastodon.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.720
Sometimes people confuse this like, oh, you have to be on Fostadon.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.880
Like, no, anywhere in Mastodon, anywhere in that social network is totally fine.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.700
Doesn't matter where you are.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.240
We'd be happy to chat with you there.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.640
You can sometimes find us on X, sometimes on LinkedIn, but, you know, Mastodon maybe.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.440
Watch the show live at pythonbytes.fm/live.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.320
Be part of the audience.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.100
Usually, Brian, usually at 10 a.m. on Mondays Pacific time, but not today, a little earlier.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:07.520
Finally, if you want a artisanal, handcrafted digest of everything that we talked about written by hand for you by Brian Okken, just join our newsletter list.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.480
Go to By The On By Side FM.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.280
Click on newsletter.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.360
We won't share your stuff.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.640
Just for us to talk with you.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.020
And with that, Brian, I believe we are ready to kick it off.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.820
It's both earlier and slightly less early than you expected.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.580
Yes.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.020
Right?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.160
It's 7.30 for our time in the morning.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.400
But actually, that's, is that 8.30?

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.180
I don't know.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.940
Like, time is weird.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.000
It's been warped.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.080
Yeah.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.260
Time's on hold right now until the end of tomorrow.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.180
But we'll see.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.480
No, but time change.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.880
But not, we're not going to talk about time change.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.440
We're going to talk about GitHub Action Security.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.560
So I ran across, let's pop this up.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.440
I ran across Ned Batchelder's GitHub Action Security, Zizmor, Z-I-Z-M-O-R.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.760
So it's not Ned's tool, but he came across it.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.640
So we'll talk a little bit about what it does.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.120
So it is, I'm going to pop over.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:08.140
It is, Zizmor is, says it's a tool for finding security issues with GitHub Action setups.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.720
So what are we talking about here?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.040
Really, there's, get action workflows are something that I don't actually look at very often.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.960
I update when I think I need to, but I haven't done a security audit of them.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.480
So I think it's a decent idea to think about that.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.420
And this article from Ned says he went through a lot of projects and did find some issues.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.340
So I think he said he found some issues.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.780
But he has, I mean, Ned supports a lot of projects.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.380
So there was a bit of work.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:51.820
So in his article, he also includes a script that he wrote to go through all of his repositories and to audits on them for their GitHub workflows.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.860
So what do you do?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.220
So this Zizmor tool, it's not a pip install.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.340
It is something you can do cargo install or brew install, I think.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.480
Yeah.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.880
Or you can get it from source.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.660
But hopefully one of those will work for you to install it.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.120
And then you just point it at your YAML, your workflow YAML file so that it does an evaluation.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.780
And then it does, it's looking, it's, this is still sort of in, I think they said that it was in alpha or, it says it's beta.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.240
So it's in beta.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.520
So it's in beta.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.680
They're still working on it.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.300
But there's, there's some things that they're looking for, like, like abandoned projects and things like that.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.440
So I think this is a kind of a cool thing.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:46.540
I don't really pay too much attention to, I sort of, I have to admit, I copy, I find another project, a Python project that's doing something similar that I want to do.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.820
And I kind of copy what they're doing in their, their GitHub action workflow.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.340
So like something like this is pretty good.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.380
There is an audit rules page, so you can see what kind of things it's looking for.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.040
And there's not much here yet, but I think they'll add more.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.300
So anyway, that's a new tool.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.100
Yeah, it looks great.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.960
Looks, looks very good.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.700
I think we want to stick with GitHub here.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:17.760
So I want to tell you about some pretty exciting news, but also not just exciting news, a pretty powerful look into the open source world.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.060
So the headline here, I ran across this and got a few plus ones from listeners, including Pat Decker.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.860
So thank you, Pat, for sending this in.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.100
This is the Octoverse Report, a.k.a.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.480
GitHub.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.400
AI leads Python to the top language as the number of global developers surge.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.060
So we previously said Python is the number one language according to Stack Overflow questions, right?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.020
This is Python is the number of link.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.520
This is the number one language as a usage on GitHub, which is, I would say, more meaningful.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.920
Maybe.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.080
I don't know.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.260
What does it mean to be number one of a language?

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.280
Is that lines of code?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.620
Is that numbers of repositories?

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.640
Is that numbers of users?

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.460
There's many metrics that could be used, right?

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.420
Yeah, I don't know.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.000
Yeah, I don't know.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.020
This article is, you know, when I first saw it, I thought, oh, this would just be like

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.900
a little headline or something.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.220
This is a 25-minute read according to Pocket.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.980
So this is a serious beast.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.500
And so I want to jump over to Pocket.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.440
And why am I using Pocket in an omnivore?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.880
Well, hang in for the extras at the end.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.020
So let's see a couple of things here.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.620
So first of all, this is for GitHub.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.820
We have 518 million total projects on GitHub.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.300
Wow.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.580
With 25% year-over-year growth.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.040
That's pretty crazy.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.160
Over a billion contributions to public and open source projects.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.280
That's not private ones.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.640
I think something like 75 or 80% of contributions are to private repos.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.120
But of the public and open source ones, that's a lot.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.760
That's a lot.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.360
And Python overtakes JavaScript as the number one language, which is pretty interesting.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.900
So I highlighted a couple of things here because there's just too much here for me to keep in my head.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.600
A rapidly growing number of developers worldwide, especially in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.820
This suggests AI isn't just helping more people learn to write code or build software faster.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.180
It's also attracting and helping more people become developers.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.860
First-time open source contributions continue to show wide-scale interest in AI projects.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.980
Importantly, we aren't seeing signs that AI has hurt open source with low-quality contributions.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.240
Again, what metric?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.380
But interesting, right?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.320
That is interesting.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.720
Yeah.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:30.940
And the headline, at least for us, is Python is now the most used language on GitHub as a global open source activity continues to extend beyond traditional software development.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:37.040
I've long thought that that's the magic of Python is it's not just, wow, this is a cool front-end framework.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.820
Or, wow, this is a cool server language.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.220
That many people coming from other areas that are not traditional developers really dive into it, right?

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.600
Yeah.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.700
So we saw Python emerge for the first time as the most used language.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:57.640
The rise of Python usage correlates with large communities of people joining open source community from across the STEM world rather than traditional community of software developers, right?

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.820
No big surprise there.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.340
They also talk about where people are, where their developers are in the world.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.220
There's three places that notably stand out.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.180
And again, what is the metric here?

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.400
I wish they were a little more clear.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:18.940
If you look at their heat map thing, then that would be the United States, by far, closely behind, would be India and then China.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.660
And then after that, it tails off fast.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.420
But is that divided by, is that per capita, right?

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.300
Like just maybe there's more people in China than, or in India or America.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:36.340
But if you look at this, they've got some cool projections into, I think this is, they have over time, but they also have projections into the future.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.340
Kind of like Stack Overflow Trends did when they came out with their big article.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.340
So that's pretty interesting.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.040
And you can sort of see where your place lands.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.380
I think there's a lot of interesting things here.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.800
Yeah.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.140
Projecting into the future.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.760
They're projecting that India is going to take over the United States and the U.S. is going to fall to number two.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.760
But also Indonesia jumps up three places.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.280
All right.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.580
A lot of interesting stuff there.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.260
Let's jump over and grab a few more of them.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:01.960
Oh, no.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.600
Go away thing.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.800
Thing is so hard to navigate.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.400
It's so big.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:04.660
Okay.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.600
So there continues to be an increase in first-time contributors.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.320
We saw 1.4 million new developers globally join the open source community.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.740
And yeah.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.220
Notably, we didn't see, again, this is one of their metrics.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.420
That was actually they called out.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.240
Notably, we did not see a rise in rejected pull requests.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.280
So anyway, there is a bunch to see here.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.660
I think one more I'd like to hit on is the rise of Jupyter Notebooks.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:36.300
If you look at their graph of Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub, it is the most Silicon Valley hockey stick dream you've ever seen, right?

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.220
There's a little glitch.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.440
So that is 2020.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.060
I don't know what happened in 2020.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.720
Nobody remembers that anyway.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.740
But no, just kidding.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.300
Maybe a little pandemic.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.060
Other than the pandemic, like this thing is just blasting off.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.780
So this is really interesting to see.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.260
Yeah.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:55.500
And AI is maybe following a similar thing just ever so slightly behind.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.880
Anyway, this is a deep article that has lots of insights across many, many aspects.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.000
So that's my big item of the week.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.600
And I think people should check it out.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.280
It's pretty interesting.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:04.860
Yeah.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.780
That's interesting.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.480
Comment from Liz from the audience.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.960
My brother is a front-end dev and started learning Python last week because he's feeling the need to become full stack.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.240
Maybe job security stuff.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.440
Some of the JavaScript people are learning Python also, maybe.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.180
Yeah.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.040
Thanks for sharing, Liz.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.420
Awesome.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.940
Let me tell you real quick about Scout APM.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.060
They're big supporters of Python Bytes.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.560
So we appreciate that very much.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.720
So if you are tired of spending hours trying to find the root cause of issues impacting your performance,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.480
then you owe it to yourself to check out Scout APM.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.900
They're a leading Python application performance monitoring tool, APM,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.580
that helps you identify and solve performance abnormalities faster and easier.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.860
Scout APM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks, slow database queries, background jobs,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.320
and the dreaded N plus one queries that you can end up if you do lazy loading in your ORM.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.720
And then you say, oh, no, why is it so slow?

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.040
Why are you doing 200 database queries for what should be one?

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.420
So you can find out things like that.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.800
And it links it back directly to source code so you can spend less time in the debugger and

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.660
healing logs and just finding the problems and moving on.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.600
And you'll love it because it's built for developers by developers.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.240
It makes it easy to get set up.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.780
Seriously, you can do it in less than four minutes.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.600
So that's awesome.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.580
And the best part is the pricing is straightforward.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:28.060
You only pay for the data that you use with no hidden overage fees or per seat pricing.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.380
And I just learned this, Brian.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.260
They also have it.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.500
They provide the pro version for free to all open source projects.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.940
So if you're an open source maintainer and you want to have Scout APM for that project,

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.800
just shoot them a message or something on their pricing page about that.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.640
So you can start your free trial and get instant insights today.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.260
Visit pythonbytes.fm/Scout.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.520
The link is in your podcast player show notes as well.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.920
And please use that link.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.760
Don't just search for them because otherwise they don't think you came from us.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.360
And then they'd stop supporting the show.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.920
So please use our link, pythonbytes.fm/Scout.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.840
Check them out.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.760
It really supports the show.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.800
Yeah, I want to talk about Python 313 again.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.500
We talked about Python 313 quite a bit on the show so far.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.160
And we even talked about 14 last week.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.240
But there's an article that I ran across from Bytecode saying,

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.080
Python 313, what didn't make the headlines?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.440
And there's a few things I want to call out that I actually missed also.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.000
So I'm glad that they wrote this up.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.900
So we had a whole bunch of nice new additions to the REPL.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:37.860
So like multi-line code block or multi-line code editing and some colors and stuff.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.540
But a lot of those have trickled down to PDB now.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:49.260
So I didn't really, possibly I didn't notice this too much because I usually debug within VS Code or PyCharm.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.160
But sometimes I do use PDB.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.520
I'm glad it's around.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.200
It's a nice Python.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.740
PDB is the Python debugger if you're unfamiliar.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.460
But what did PDB get?

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.680
It got multi-line editing, which is just cool.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.100
It got code completion just like the REPL.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.480
What's some other things?

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.380
Break accepts dotted paths.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.660
I really know what that means.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.660
So you can easily add breakpoints to any lib dynamically.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.660
Oh, that makes sense.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:23.680
Is it maybe like dot, dot, slash this or dot, dot, you know, kind of the relative imports?

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.140
Yeah.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:24.700
Probably.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.240
Anyway, mostly the first two I'm really pretty excited about.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.620
Code completion and multi-line editing within PDB.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.260
That's a great, great addition.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.040
So cool to have those go into PDB as well.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.020
Some.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.640
And yeah, what else do I want to highlight?

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.000
There's a few other things in here that I thought were pretty cool.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:50.340
There's Pathlib had some, a lot of performance optimizations, which is great.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.440
Because I love, I use Pathlib all the time now.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.460
So if it's a little bit faster, great.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:57.860
Awesome.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.100
I like that.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.000
And SHUTIL, SHUTIL.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.560
Yeah.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.060
Yeah.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.280
Do you use SHUTIL much?

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.320
Yeah, a little bit.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:04.940
Not a ton.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.980
But when I want it, it's like very welcome.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.420
Yeah.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.180
The SHUTIL or SHUTIL.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.880
I never know how to pronounce that.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.300
It's probably SHUTIL.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.220
Anyway.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.740
Yeah.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.580
What did we say about that?

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:27.320
The SHUTIL module providing high-level file system operations such as recursive delete and copy has seen tweaks.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.540
Many, many bugs were fixed and options were added.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.100
You can choose how to handle symlinks.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:33.980
Oh, that's cool.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.640
Ooh.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.900
Yeah.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.100
I'm going to have to check that out.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.540
That's great.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.340
And then one of the things about virtual environments, which I did not know.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.240
Scroll to the end.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:58.160
So I've been enjoying this with, I've been, when creating virtual environments with UV, VENV, it creates a little dot get ignore so that the entire thing gets, your virtual environment directory gets ignored.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.560
But Python-MVENV does that now.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.640
The built-in virtual environment tool.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.020
Nice.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.920
Adds that as well.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:12.640
Speaking of that, though, this is kind of a tangent, but I just learned, I can't, I think I can't remember where I learned it from.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:25.900
Somebody on Mastodon, I think it may have been Jeff Triplett, but I'm not sure, said that one of the things I've noticed when I use a virtual environment created by UV is that it doesn't install PIP.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.880
So PIP's not there.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.480
So you use UV pip instead.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.660
But you can have it install PIP.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.280
You could just, oh, what is it?

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.880
You add a flag.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.720
Dash-seed, I believe it is.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.440
Dash-seed.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:37.940
That's it.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.160
I'm glad I didn't write it down.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:45.520
So if you miss pip from a UV virtual environment, add it with Dash-seed.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.280
So anyway, cool.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:15:01.440
I'm glad that this article, ooh, RE functions such as find all, split, search, and sub, can now be interpreted, which performs short, repeated matches, can now be interpreted by the user.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.340
Interrupted.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.800
Ah, interrupted by user.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.780
I read that wrong.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:14.780
So some of these could go off and do things that are evil and stop your code, and now you can control C it.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.320
That's good.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.860
So there's lots of great new things in Python 3.13.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.040
I've just jumped in and started using it, and I think it just works great.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.540
Wow, that's very cool.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.100
Yeah, I switched these in it as well.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.020
Anyway.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:26.640
All right.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.920
And Python bytes the websites running on it too, by the way.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.980
Oh, nice.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.340
Why wouldn't it?

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:31.800
Yeah.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.420
All right.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.160
Shall we talk conferences, Brian?

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:34.920
Sure.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.080
Let's talk conferences.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.020
So I saw you had an extra on this, but I had already pipped it for the main one.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.540
See that for double meaning there?

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.280
Oh, it works.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:49.940
So PyCon US 2025 is now officially announced in terms of specific details.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.660
It's pretty cool.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.580
I'm pretty excited.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.580
It's back in Pittsburgh because it's year two of the two-year deal.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.640
So if you went last year, same deal.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.420
If you didn't, well, we had a lot of fun there, so you can check it out.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.820
There's many interesting things.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.780
The website doesn't make it incredibly clear.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:06.060
Oh, yeah.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:06.980
Here, if you scroll down far enough.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:07.240
Perfect.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:07.900
The breakdown.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.760
So if you go down here to the breakdown, I think this is probably the first question people

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.040
have.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.180
There's two questions I imagine many people would have straight up here.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.580
First one is, when is it?

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.820
Because it has a huge span of eight days that the conference is, but it's not really those

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.260
dates, depending on what you want to do.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:28.420
For example, tutorials are May 14 and 15, 2025, but the main conference is 16 to 18.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.100
There's a good chance that you will find me at the main conference.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.540
I plan on going unless something comes up with family commitments or something I can't make,

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:36.820
you know?

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.000
But the plan right now for me is to go to the main conference, and that's pretty much it.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.760
But how about you?

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.680
You think you might go this year?

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.580
I have a hair appointment on that date.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.060
Well, I understand.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.740
Your hair is pretty amazing these days, so it does need a lot of attention.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.940
It's pretty far out.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.480
I'm not sure.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.240
I'm still on the fence with this one.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:54.940
Yep.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.380
Okay.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.640
So that's question number one.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.200
When is it?

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.100
Question number two.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.060
Call for proposals.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.520
No, that's number three.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.920
Number two is, do I have to wear a mask all day?

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.020
Are we going to wait until like a different time?

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.600
Are we going to like, hey, let's pretend the world isn't the way it is, but it is a different

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:11.820
way?

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.300
No.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.040
In fact, that's exactly the policy that I hoped it would be, and I strongly encourage

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.760
it just like the policy is masks are strongly encouraged, but not required.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.960
Please respect people who choose to wear a mask.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.320
Great.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.000
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.640
Yeah.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.560
That's great.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.380
That seems reasonable.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.000
That seems congruent with the world right now.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.100
I might go extreme and wear like a mask and flight goggles and a hat.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.560
I was going to say, put on like some ski gear, put on some goggles and a helmet and snorkel.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.700
No, this is, I, yeah, snorkel.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.820
Well, just bring your, your Apple vision pro put on your snorkel.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.360
Yeah.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.580
That'd be funny to put like a, like a COVID mask on the top of the snorkel at the end.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.680
Yeah.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.260
No, this, this is really good.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:59.100
So they're taking lots of precautions, you know, as you hand sanitizing stations.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.840
Conferences are full of germs, regardless of COVID.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.460
Please have these kinds of things.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:03.680
Right.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.800
And things like, Hey, we have outdoor areas where eating will be available.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.060
If anyone's listening and they're, they're in charge of this.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:10.720
Chairs.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.300
I encourage you.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:11.900
Yes.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.380
Chairs.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:12.700
Please.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.700
Last time there was a roof area with a, like a cover and it was beautiful.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.440
You could see over the river and there were these tall, tall tables, no chairs.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.080
And my back just hurt so much after carrying all the recording equipment on my back for half

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.300
a day.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.580
I'm like, I just got to sit down somewhere.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.760
There was literally not a single chair of like, could there just be a chair?

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.900
So chairs, please.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:32.600
Some chairs.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.440
But other than that, I think this is great.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.800
So at least one chair with a tag on it.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.740
This is for Michael.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.540
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.320
Please reserved.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.740
The dude's back hurts a lot.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.280
Just look at him.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.380
He's whinging over there.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:42.680
All right.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.380
And then somewhere in here, there's call for proposals.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.320
Under speaking.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.000
Yes.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.020
Appears in a talk.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.940
Important deadline.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.500
We have just over a month.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.600
But it's open now.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.180
You can start.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:54.580
Yeah.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:54.740
Yeah.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.440
So there it is.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:55.800
Yeah.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.200
There it is.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.320
So awesome.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:57.840
I'm excited.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.640
I'm excited.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.300
Oh, I can.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.800
Now I'll be there.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.540
Super excited.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.560
I mean, I think I'll see a couple of talks.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.100
Yeah.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:04.960
See, look at that.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.200
Okay.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.100
Very good.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.520
Plus the website is beautiful.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.620
I like that.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:08.860
It is.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:09.320
I like that.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.780
It's got a good, it's got a good fun vibe.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.720
And I know you,

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.680
have previously maybe still do skateboarding.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.340
Look at that guy.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.580
Just riding that rail there.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.060
I mean, already you want to go, right?

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.640
Is there, they're probably gonna have skateboard, skateparks at the conference, I guess.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.360
Yeah.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.700
I would say why not.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.800
I imagine why not.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.580
Oh, the snakes.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.000
Sweet half pipe.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.760
Half pipe.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.740
Yeah.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.760
That's, what is the snake riding?

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.160
Anyway.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.740
It's sort of a skate.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.320
I think it's a skateboard with beans on the bottom.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.000
Mm-hmm.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.440
Oh, no.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.740
Those are just, I don't know.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.020
Those are just good wheels.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:39.620
Yeah.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.140
Well, we're trying to put a lot of meaning into this.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.620
No.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.300
Anyway.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:45.800
Okay.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.300
All right.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:51.000

Thank you to Codeium for supporting Python Bytes.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.960
How about extras?

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.100
How extra are you feeling?

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.440
I only got one extra.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:07.420
And that is to say, this is from Jeff Triplett saying, please publish and share more.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.920
And he did talk about this on Mastodon a little bit.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:19.320
The thought is that he sees a lot of great ideas on Mastodon and people posting.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.400
And the thought process and research and stuff that goes into publishing a couple of those

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.660
ideas and maybe their threads.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.600
You're almost to a post.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.760
Just write it up.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.800
And I totally agree.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:42.580
It's great to post on social media, but why not just write it on a blog and then do a snippet of it and link to it from Mastodon or whatever social you're posting it on.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.280
Totally agree.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.640
And encourage people to do that more.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:55.320
And there's a little bit around it, like talking about he says he uses Grammarly because of dyslexia, which is I didn't know that about Jeff.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:55.960
That's pretty cool.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:01.000
And I don't mean to plug Grammarly, but it did help one of my kids get through college.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.120
This episode is sponsored by Grammarly.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.240
But if you don't want to pay for something, he's also recommending something called Language Tool.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.280
There's a link to it in his post.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.360
Pretty cool.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.020
But also, you don't really need to do that.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.080
It's fine to just, I mean, we're all nerds here.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.900
Write up something you learned.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:25.900
Post it on a blog and link to it in a Mastodon post or something.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.880
Let us know about it.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:37.440
And, you know, if there's something glaringly technical editors or technical errors, one of your readers will let you know to fix it.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.200
But it's to be nice.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.080
It's not to be mean.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.140
And I encourage that, too.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:47.380
I actually don't use any grammar checkers when I'm writing blog posts.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.360
I just put it.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:48.620
Nice.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.160
Anyway.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.500
Yeah, you and I both have our blogs on Hugo, which you write with Markdown.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.300
And I have a little bit of a hack for folks if they also do that.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:07.920
I've started writing my posts, my longer posts, at least, on something like Google Docs, where you get grammar checking and help and auto-complete and all that kind of stuff.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:14.880
And I've found if you just control A, control C, and paste it into Typeora, it will markdownify everything.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.420
Like, H2s become hash-hash things, and all the links become bracket links and folds, all that kind of stuff.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.200
Really, really nice.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.240
So if you want a little bit of support, but then you're also doing a markdown, that's a pretty sweet one.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.300
Paste it to where?

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.140
Appfora?

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:27.620
Typeora.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.500
Typeora.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.420
Typeora.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:29.660
What?

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.900
Typeora is an amazing markdown editor.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.400
Yeah.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.120
Appfora is really good.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.780
I usually just use VS Code, and it does enough grammar and spelling checking for me.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:43.680
Did you know that Typeora you can save as an EPUB file if you want?

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.040
Okay.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:45.740
That's pretty cool.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.500
I mean, all sorts of good stuff in there.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.040
You can write an e-book.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:49.840
Exactly.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.620
Exactly.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.820
Anyway, that's pretty good.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.540
All right.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.020
All right.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.920
I got a couple extras, but I'll go quick.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.960
I just recently had Stephanie Mullen on to talk about pre-commit hooks.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.080
I think I talked about that.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.260
That was going to be on, and now it has happened.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.780
Now I'm talking about it having happened.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:10.860
The reason I bring that up is one of the things that I just ran across is pre-commit UV.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.560
So this is pretty cool.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.840
From the Tox dev group.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:20.560
Uses UV to create virtual environments and installing packages for pre-commit rather than regular ones.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.380
So this is pretty cool.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.600
So, you know, that's something that Tox and Nox and friends all do a lot of.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.400
So pretty cool.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.820
People can check that out if they like.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.220
Nice.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.640
Why?

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.660
Why, Brian, was I using Pocket?

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.420
Did you see how much I had to struggle with that thing?

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.280
That's because my favorite read later thing is shutting down.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.400
Omnivore is shutting down.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:47.380
Not because they went out of business because they were awesome, but because they got bought and they decided it's too expensive to run text-based highlights.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.380
I don't know.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:54.280
It doesn't seem that intense.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.640
It's not profitable enough.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.340
It's not.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.940
And, I mean, get on it, folks.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.620
Because one of people who started using it because we recommended it is pointing this out to me.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:12.060
Omnivore will support exports of your data into JSON because what are you going to do with that until November 30th?

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.840
And then after that time, we will be deleting all of your data.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.620
So, yeah, have fun with that.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.300
There's a lot of options.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.840
Readwise has been recommended.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.040
Pocket is an option.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.680
Instapaper.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.700
I found some really cool open source self-hosted ones.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.560
I'm like, no, Michael, you don't need more things to babysit.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.240
Just log back into Pocket.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.300
I've been using Pocket.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.860
It works for me.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.540
It's not great, but it works.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.720
It's pretty good.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.880
I didn't realize Instapaper was still around.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.480
I was using that back in the day.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.400
Yeah, I know.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:43.740
Me too.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.000
Back in the day.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.560
It was a good one.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:45.940
All right.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.900
The voices, though, and that's what they were required by.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.700
They were required by this thing called 11 Labs, which is all about creating Givit audio.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.820
And I was pretty excited.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.340
I'm like, oh, this might just make it even better.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.680
Free text-to-speech and voice generated.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.800
I'm like, okay, I could just download that and check it out, right?

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.100
But if you look at the pricing, it's ridiculous.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:09.200
I mean, you get, for five bucks a month, you get 30 minutes of speech.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.320
I mean, that's like e-book, audio book prices, but they don't generate the book.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.200
They just speak it.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.140
For $11, you get an hour and a half per month.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:18.980
Okay.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.200
If your only purpose is to read stuff in audio to somebody and say, like, you only get 30

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.100
minutes of it per month.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:24.620
I don't know.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.140
It's kind of weird.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:25.840
But...

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.760
And the jump between that and 99 bucks.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.300
11 to $99.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.300
That's a big jump.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:31.960
That's a month.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.600
That's not a year.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.340
To have it read you text off the internet.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.080
That's pretty steep.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.120
So I was kind of excited, but I'm like not excited.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.740
So the text in the show notes is curse you, Omnivore.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.280
Curse you.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.260
Hey, I talked about moving to Hetzner and some of the US data centers and I played around

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:48.600
with that.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.160
And you know what?

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.820
Python buys a run on Hetzner right now.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.840
Oh, nice.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.420
And talk Python and all the things.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:58.980
Because of the whole new Docker cluster sort of portable across cloud thing that I did before,

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.240
it was pretty easy to just try it out.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.440
And I'm like, hey, this works really well.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:09.260
I'm going to try it because you get really nice new CPUs like AMD Epic CPUs.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.220
and stuff along those lines, which is great.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:16.020
And this is not a massive concern, but wow, are the prices good for this thing.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.640
So for example, check this out.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.220
We could go to the US and you could get it in Hillsborough or Ashland.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:26.260
Ashland unfortunately makes more sense for consumers, but I wanted to run it locally

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.280
because Hillsborough is just outside of Portland.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:34.720
Anyway, Ashland, but totally reasonable to run it for $13 a month or something or $20 a month.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:42.740
Like for example, they have a $25 a month, 8 CPU, 16 gig server with 20 terabytes of bandwidth.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:48.960
That is a $250 AWS server and a $300 Azure server for $25.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.900
So anyway, pretty interesting stuff.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.560
25 euro, but that's, yeah.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:52.960
Yeah, that's true.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.580
Euro, sorry.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.380
They're pretty close.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:54.860
Yeah.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.640
E-bucks.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.700
Euro bucks.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.240
Okay.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:05.020
Also, we've talked previously about free threader Python over and over, but there is now a pretty

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.260
awesome new thing that you can do with UV.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.140
I know we're talking a lot about UV these days, but that's because it's making a big splash

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.760
and it's really cool.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.080
UV, Python install, dash, dash preference, only managed.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:24.280
And if 3.13 T will create you either install or create you a virtual environment on free

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.180
threaded Python.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.140
How cool is that?

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:26.620
Okay.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.460
We've been waiting for that.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.080
So that's cool.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:28.540
Yeah.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:28.840
Yeah.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.360
That's really neat.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.200
So probably the quickest, you know, you can see I ran an example.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.460
I'm linking to a mass on post, a screenshot I posted in 2.53 seconds to install free threaded

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:37.780
Python.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:42.640
It's that close to, and that's of course why the pre-commit hooks want to use this to install

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.660
other things and so on.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.040
Yeah.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:44.940
That's pretty neat.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:50.320
Also, remember if you're going to try something like that, you probably need to do a UV self

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.440
update first.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.080
Yes.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.980
That's a very good point, Brian, because it doesn't check remotely.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.480
It just knows what's burnt into the binary of UV.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.480
And if you don't UV self update, it will only possibly know the old one.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.520
So yeah, that's, that's always the place to start with UV.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.000
It seems.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.440
Yeah.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.020
I just updated a three through just the normal 313 the other day and it wouldn't work.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:09.980
Like why not?

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.620
And it was because I needed to self update.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.000
Yeah.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.160
Good, good, good, good deal.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:13.800
All right.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.760
That wasn't very funny, but I have something.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.200
I don't know.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.960
We'll see if it's funny or not, but I have something for you.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.540
You ready?

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.680
Ready to close out with a joke?

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.220
Yes.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:20.820
All right.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.640
So we have different kinds of chairs in life.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.460
Did you know that, Brian?

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.520
Like you can have one of the gaming chairs.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.960
You can have an, I have a slightly uncomfortable chair, so I don't move around away from my

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.560
mic and go like this and then like this and like sort of keeps me fixed, but it's not

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.020
that comfy.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.080
But I would like to present to you two types of chairs that are in opposition to each other

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.680
or, no, this is a synergy.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.600
Let's call this a synergy.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.880
You have a coding chair, which looks like an office chair.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.380
And you have the debugging chair, which looks like a toilet.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.780
Just two of the different types of chairs you may try to sit in.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.520
Yeah.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:58.540
Actually, you know, if, if it's just the, the thought process is, take your laptop to

00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:58.980
the bathroom.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.060
I don't recommend it.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.220
But, but if it's.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:02.980
I can't leave the bathroom.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.140
My bug is still out there.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:04.920
No, I don't know.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.320
Just get away from the keyboard for a while.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.180
I agree.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.340
Yeah.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.400
Yeah.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.980
I think the message here, the underlying reality of the joke is that sometimes

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.740
if you just step away, it unlocks, unlocks problems.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.980
I know when I was doing this migration of all my, I set up, I, I couldn't get let's

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.100
encrypt to work and that was midnight or something.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.880
Stupid let's encrypt.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.540
I went to sleep.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.040
I was like Docker let's encrypt combo of not working.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.000
Woke up the next day.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.020
I'm like, oh yeah, that'll do.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.800
And I just typed in some different boom off of wind.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.460
You know what I mean?

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.660
But I spent half an hour banging my head against it.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.800
I, so if this has been, this hasn't happened to me for very long, but it's been

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.100
happened to me lately is, is I'll be stuck on an issue.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.500
And then, and then I wake up early and I think, and I think about the, of one of the

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.760
possible, a possible solution, something I want to try in the code.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.040
And I'm like, oh, what time is it?

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.260
I mean, if it's like just only like an hour before normal, it's fine.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.940
But often it's like one in the morning.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.660
Oh no.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.120
I cannot get up right now.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.040
I will be exhausted in the morning.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.460
So just have to jot it down and go back to sleep.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.240
Yeah.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:07.960
Yeah.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.860
Anyway, cool.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.460
Well, great show as usual.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:10.840
Thanks.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.740
Thanks again, Michael.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.460
Yeah, you bet.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.400
Thank you for being here and thanks everyone for listening.
