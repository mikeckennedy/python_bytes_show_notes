00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
>> Hello and welcome to Python Bytes,

recorded March 19th, 2024.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.580
I think I got that right. I am Brian Okken.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.240
>> I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.080

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.280
Michael, what do you got for us?

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.560
>> Well, I would like to start off

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.040
by telling you about another country,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.440
maybe one you haven't heard of.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.560
>> Canada?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.600
>> You've heard of Canada, you've heard of the US,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.360
you've heard of Germany, you've heard of Slovakia,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.000
you've heard of the Philippines.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.400
Have you heard of Pi country?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.480
>> Oh, this should have a song with it.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.400
In a Pi country.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.880
>> Does it involve a banjo?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.920
I don't know what it's called.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920
>> I hope not.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.240
>> I know. I hope not too.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.200
>> We should have covered this on the 14th.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.680
>> Pi country, Pi day, all the things.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.320
So Pi country, it solves

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.800
something that might not sound like a great big problem

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.680
until you try to deal with this and you're like,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.400
are you serious? There are this many things.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.680
It's similar to dealing with time zones.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.200
You're like, how complicated can be?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.280
What are there, 24?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160
No. What are their abbreviations?

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.600
What are all the different ways in which

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.480
they can be abbreviated and so on?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.960
This is that for country.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.480
So it's a Python library to access ISO.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.520
These are standards, country, subdivision,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.280
what's a subdivision, language,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.480
currency, and script definitions,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.160
and their translations for all the countries of the world,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.400
including deleted countries

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.280
that used to be countries but are not.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.360
I would have considered those just former countries,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.960
but deleted is a very digital way to think of it.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.760
We just selected that part and we hit

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.400
command backslash and it really deletes it all the way.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.920
Anyway, this is really interesting and it's used by

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.440
17.9 thousand different projects, which is pretty cool.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.640
So here's the deal.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.680
You go in here and somewhere,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.320
you can just go into it and you say,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.720
pycountry.countries and there's 249 here.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.120
You get these, not just a list of strings,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.680
but you get rich objects back.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.040
Like the first one is Afghanistan.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.640
So country, it's a class.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.360
It has the Alpha 2 code,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.160
which is AF, the Alpha 3 code,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.320
AFG, and that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.720
That's like, why are there so many variations?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.400
You can represent the shorthand version like just two letters,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.160
but you can also use three letters or there's numeric versions.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.280
There's like the full name versus the colloquial name.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.560
So Afghanistan versus the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.960
>> Oh, this is cool. I might learn something.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.240
>> Yeah, exactly. There's a lot more in here.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.240
It has a dictionary-like access for the variation.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.880
So you can say, get Alpha 2 equals

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.680
DE and you'll get good old Deutschland,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.120
or you could say Alpha 3 equals

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.120
DEU or the name equals Germany or all these different ways in

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.440
which you can query this or given one,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.120
you can obviously just access all these properties.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.520
Like Brian, you would know that it's the Federal Republic of Germany.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.360
It has fuzzy searching for country.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.640
So I can say, give me England.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.680
It's like, yeah, there's no England.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.000
What? But there's this thing called United Kingdom,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.880
which has its center in England maybe,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.160
and that's GB and so on.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.800
So yeah, pretty neat.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.520
You can say fuzzy search for Cote and you get Cote d'Ivoire.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.400
Sorry, folks, from there,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.200
but it'll even match when it's not exactly the right character.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.120
Oh, hat, I don't know what that's called.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.440
Not an umlaut, but a hat-looking thing.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.320
But you don't have that in the search.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.360
So this is more, like I said,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.920
there's more to this than just a list of countries.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.040
Then it's historic countries.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.000
These are the ones. Since I read this,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.880
did they change it from historic to deleted?

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.680
I don't know. Historic countries, subdivisions.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.840
Like what is a subdivision of a country?

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.080
This is like states or providences.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.120
It's not nearly as strange as it sounds.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.800
There's scripts also. What is a script?

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.360
It's written language versus spoken language.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.440
Those might be the same thing,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.480
but they might also not be the same,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.600
like Latin, for example, right?

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.840
Oh, yeah.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.040
Currencies are in here.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.560
Languages are in here.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.040
Locales are in here.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.680
So if you do anything with countries,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.400
this might be worth looking at.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.560
That's pretty cool.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.400
Yeah.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.120
It's still like hung up on the England isn't a country,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.960
but okay.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.040
According to Pi country, it's not a country.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.880
Okay.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.160
And also, so yeah, I'll have to look into this more.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.200
Is it a subdivision?

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.480
Maybe it's a subdivision.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.040
And, but also like, where does the word Deutschland

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.320
fit in for Germany?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.200
Is that not even listed?

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.040
Yeah. Well, also since it has translations.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.920
So for example, German,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.880
if you ask a German person where they're from,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.160
they'll say Deutschland,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.840
unless they're speaking English to people, right?

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.720
Like they refer to it as Deutschland.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.560
Yeah.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.760
But for some reason, we don't agree.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.600
We don't call it that.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.240
We call it Germany, right?

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.080
So I don't know.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.120
It's interesting.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.240
I suspect if you use the translations maybe,

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.880
and you said, you know, what is the name,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.640
the official name of Germany?

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.920
It probably wouldn't say the Federal Republic of Germany.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.560
We have that translated, right?

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.400
Interesting.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.240
Yeah.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.160
Like Switzerland is,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.000
Sveits?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.920
I can't remember exactly, but yeah, it's different.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.800
It goes by different names in different languages.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.120
So I think it also has those

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.160
when it talks about the translations.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.080
Cool, neat.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.960
Well, we could point to countries.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.800
I'm trying to do a transition.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.240
Or we could point to objects.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.160
And does Python have pointers?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.680
You can't really point to a country.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.840
I don't know.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.680
Maybe.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.760
Point to directions.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.240
Canada's that way.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.440
Canada's that way?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.400
No, Canada's this way.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.240
Oh man.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.240
But we're probably pointing to different directions.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.800
Anyway.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.640
So Ned Batchelder has an article called,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.920
does Python have pointers?

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.320
And I'm like, yeah, no, it doesn't.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.680
But kind of does.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.880
Anyway, I'm highlighting this

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.760
because I think it's a really good article

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.880
for somebody that's coming from a language

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.880
that does have pointers and stuff to Python

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.720
because it's a good entry way into names in Python.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.840
So the article does Python have pointers,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.840
but it's kind of pointing to the idea

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.640
of like talking about the ID function.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.520
And I know about the ID function really well.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.360
So if you say ID of an object or a variable name,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.120
it tells you like a number for what it points to.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.920
Like where the, I don't know,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.640
it's a representation of the memory address or something.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.160
That's kind of what a pointer is, right?

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.640
But you can't in C and C++ and Rust and other things,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.640
you can dereference it.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.560
Using that, you can create a variable.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.240
Using the address, you can create a variable

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.360
that points to that thing.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.720
And you cannot do that within Python.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.080
So it is different,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.880
but also kind of everything is a pointer in Python.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.240
And that's sort of Ned's point is,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.960
point, pointer,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.840
is that with like just normal object,

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.120
we can say like my var equals 17,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.160
and then we can have,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.920
if you do my pointer, it doesn't help you any.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.960
But you can do another variable

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.200
that points to the same thing and it works.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.240
It's when, it's just sort of how names work.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.240
I'm describing this very poorly,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.560
but this is a good entry point into, well, how objects work.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.400
And luckily, Ned also links to a talk he did,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.720
names that refer to objects.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.920
And so he did a talk in 2015,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.920
and still the slides are up in the video,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.280
but even the slides just going through it,

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.040
it's really good to understand just really how names work.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.960
We're just, in Python, we just kind of point to things.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.080
And so I'm gonna link,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.120
we're gonna link also to the 2015 article,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.640
Python Names and Values.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.200
And really, this was the trick.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.480
When I really could grok this thing with Python,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.680
then I could understand Python.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.920
Everything else seems easy after this.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.960
So good job, Ned.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.440
- Yeah, Ned always has good writing.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.680
I'm subscribed to his RSS feed.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.160
I think it's interesting to consider whether Python,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
you know, the article, does Python have pointers?

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.600
Like, boy, howdy, does it?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.840
(both laughing)

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.680
- Yeah, yeah.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.480
- Like, it has more pointers than C++, which is insane.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.520
It doesn't have a wider variety of ways

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.080
to like dereference them, you know, as stars,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.200
like casting a void star, star to something else.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.840
But everything, literally everything in Python is a pointer.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.280
Even numbers are pointers.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.520
Whereas in C++, numbers usually are value types, right?

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.960
And you can have stuff that's on the stack

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.480
that's not a pointer, just has the value.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.240
In Python, there is no way to have just a value.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.240
Every, everything is a pointer, often pointers to pointer.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.640
You know, you're traversing something to something, right?

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.960
It's like, I'm going to find the dictionary of the class,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.280
and then I'm following that to where it points to

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.360
to get to the value.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.200
So it's worth spending some time on,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.200
even though you don't ever see a star

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.200
or an ampersand in the context of like

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.760
juggling pointers in Python.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.480
- Yeah, and like vectors or lists in Python are not,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.360
they're not the start of a chunk of memory

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.880
that represents all of your items.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.080
That's not what's going on.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.280
It's something completely different.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.840
Forget that.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.760
So, yeah.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.080
- Indeed, indeed.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.560
Very good, very good.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.520
- Well, changing gears a little bit,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.960
we'd like to thank Scout APM for sponsoring this episode.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.320
- Yes, we would.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.280
Let me tell you real quick about Scout APM.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.000
They're big supporters of Python Bytes,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.760
so we appreciate that very much.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.640
So if you are tired of spending hours

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.640
trying to find the root cause of issues

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.880
impacting your performance,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.920
then you owe it to yourself to check out Scout APM.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.840
They're a leading Python application

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.720
performance monitoring tool, APM,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.800
that helps you identify and solve performance abnormalities

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.200
faster and easier.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.160
Scout APM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
slow database queries, background jobs,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160
and the dreaded N+1 queries that you can end up

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.880
if you do lazy loading in your ORM,

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.160
and then you say, "Oh no, why is it so slow?

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.480
"Why are you doing 200 database queries

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.640
"for what should be one?"

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.040
So you can find out things like that.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.800
And it links it back directly to source code,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.000
so you can spend less time in the debugger

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.760
and healing logs and just finding the problems

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.600
and moving on.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.000
And you'll love it because it's built

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.560
for developers by developers.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.360
It makes it easy to get set up.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.640
Seriously, you can do it in less than four minutes,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.600
so that's awesome.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.160
And the best part is the pricing is straightforward.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.600
You only pay for the data that you use

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.520
with no hidden overage fees or per seat pricing.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.440
And I just learned this, Brian,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.560
they also have, they provide the pro version

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.640
for free to all open source projects.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.520
So if you're an open source maintainer

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.360
and you want to have Scout APM for that project,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.800
just shoot them a message or something

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.520
on their pricing page about that.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.040
So you can start your free trial

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.240
and get instant insights today.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.800
Visit pythonbytes.fm/scout.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.240
The link is in your podcast player show notes as well.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.160
And please use that link.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.960
Don't just search for them because otherwise

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.320
they don't think you came from us.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.720
And then they'd stop supporting the show.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.480
So please use our link pythonbytes.fm/scout.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.320
Check them out.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.440
It really supports the show.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.280
- Yes, it does.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.120
- Thank you.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.960
It does, it sure does.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.280
Now, Brian, let's talk about ingestion, data ingestion.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.320
- Okay.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.080
So here's that open source CLI tool.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.400
It's not exactly Python focused,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.840
but certainly useful for Python people.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.200
Ingestor, and it's straight out of the web 2.0 days

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.160
'cause it's dropping some of the vowels.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
It says copy data between any source

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.840
and any destination thinking database type things.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.920
So what you do is you just say ingestor, ingest.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.800
Source database connection is whatever.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.560
Source table is whatever.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.040
And then the destination is where it goes.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.600
And all of a sudden now you have that.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.360
So do you want your Postgres data to appear over in BigQuery?

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.880
Do you want your MongoDB collection

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.520
to show up in Postgres?

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.440
One CLI command done.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.400
- Oh, that's pretty cool.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.280
- It's pretty cool, right?

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.120
- Yeah.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.040
- So it's a command line application that allows ingesting

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.400
or copying data from any source into any database.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.400
I mean, this guy probably should be a star on any.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.600
How about many, many data sources?

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.520
- Okay, yeah.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.520
- Yeah, so if we jump over here to their docs

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.120
where like their homepage is kind of just

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.240
to catch your interest.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.640
So you can copy, I'll find the sources

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.560
and tell you about them in a second.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.320
But it says there's three ways to copy stuff over.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.200
You can do an append, which is kind of cool.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.520
Like if you've got multiple data sources

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.280
that are localized saving of data

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.400
and you want to put them all into one place.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.880
Like if you had a bunch of SQLite files

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.480
from different locations, say you've got a bunch of,

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.520
I don't know, a bunch of IoT things,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.160
or you got a bunch of servers

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.840
and they each keep some data in a SQLite file

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.200
and you want to put that into one big database, right?

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.120
You could do append.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.720
Or you could say merge.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.200
I'm guessing if the primary key is the same,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.640
it just skips it, maybe it doesn't update to that thing

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.440
if the fields are different, I don't know.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.720
Or you can just wipe it free and insert.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.120
So like a clean replacement, delete and insert.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.840
- Yeah. - Yeah, pretty cool.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.200
And then somewhere down here, supported sources.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.920
Here's where I was joking about the any.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.480
Supports Postgres and it has,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.040
some of them are bidirectional source or destination.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.000
Some are just source, some are just destination.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.440
Postgres, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Databricks,

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.480
DiffDB, Microsoft SQL Server,

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.120
and CSV files are all bidirectional.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.240
CSV files are bidirectional, okay?

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.560
But Mongo, Oracle, SQLite, and MySQL are only sources.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.320
So I don't know why MongoDB is not a destination

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.920
'cause it's incredibly easy to just have like a flat file,

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.080
a flat table, no like nested stuff.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.840
I know if you're copying from a relational database,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.360
but yeah, whatever.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.000
Still pretty cool, I think, to be able to use this.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.840
So if you got just data you wanna keep in sync

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.440
or migrate over, you're thinking of writing Python code

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.560
to do it, you might not have to write any code at all.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.480
- Well, that's pretty cool.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.000
I don't know what Snowflake is.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.840
It's a great name.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.240
- Yeah, we're getting out of that season right now.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.040
It's starting to be warm and summer's coming,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.360
but it'll be back in the fall, like maybe December.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.320
No.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.520
- That's funny, cool.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.360
Well, yeah, very interesting.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.080
Speaking of command lines,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.920
I ran across David Lord's article, "Make your terminal nice."

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.080
And this is just sort of a little shout out

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.880
because so apparently David is using,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.600
he's using Phish, which I haven't heard about for a while.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.640
So a nicer prompt with Starship and a nicer shell with Phish.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.800
And this isn't really a detailed article,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.740
but it's just sort of like things can be nicer.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.440
And I was reminded about this

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.240
because I think a long time ago we were talking with,

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.960
anyway, somebody else about Starship.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.120
And I was like, I should try Starship.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.120
And I tried it and for some reason it didn't work for me.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.760
But I'm like, this, I think it's time to start again.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.000
And so I looked into both of these.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.560
I tried Phish and I do really appreciate

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.960
that it says finally a command line shell for the 90s,

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.360
which is awesome and funny.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.240
And it's also in Comic Sans, which I ironically appreciate.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.700
But the scripting language is a little different

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.680
and I've got a lot of customizations for Bash

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.660
and Z Shell is very compatible with Bash.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.360
So I usually use either Bash or Z Shell.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.100
And I think I'm gonna stick with that.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.120
But Starship, Starship's amazing.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.780
And so I switched to Starship and the,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.660
when you go to Starship, there's an installation guide

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.500
and really it was so easy.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.580
It was, there's a macOS line.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.360
You just curl install it or you can homebrew.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.620
Think I did the homebrew thing.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.180
Anyway, but then how do you use it?

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.720
There's a usage of just, so I was on Z Shell.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.360
So you just had to add one line to your Z Shell RC,

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.880
but there's instructions on how to do it within Bash

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.800
or Phish or PowerShell or, oh cool,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.240
it works with PowerShell, that's pretty neat.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.680
For all you Windows people out there.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.520
But so what you get, what I really like is this notion

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.520
of the directory is right there listed above your command.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:01.840
And then listing what I really like is what my get branch is

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.200
my directory, which version of Python I'm using.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.280
The example here shows a rust,

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.520
but it shows which version of Python you're using.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.980
And then also what virtual environment you're in.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.440
So having, and I didn't configure that at all.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.480
That's just the default.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.480
Then I'm like, that's good.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.040
I'm good with that.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.700
So I haven't configured it at all.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.560
Just the default right out of the box.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.720
It works really good.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.520
So I'm pretty happy so far.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.360
Anyway. - Nice.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.480
Yeah, I think there's a lot of options here, right?

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.880
There's on my Z Shell, there's Starship.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.560
There's all the different shells.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.640
These days I'm using warp, warp.dev,

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.520
which is pretty excellent.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.000
I talked about that on the show before.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.120
- I kind of forgot about warp.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:39.960
We should try it.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.760
- Yeah, warp is cool.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.980
I think the big thing,

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.500
the big message people should take away from this is,

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.540
don't just take what your operating system gives you.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.560
It's really quite bad.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.940
It's not just not great, it's bad.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.300
And a lot of people who are like,

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.780
I don't really like, I'm not really a terminal person,

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.100
or I'm not a CLI person.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:04.660
Like that's because they didn't spend 30 minutes once

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.480
getting into it.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.500
Like, oh, actually, oh, that's nice.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.340
And like you pointed out, like, oh, well,

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.820
is there a virtual environment active?

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.340
What is its version?

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.740
And then all these other things,

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.740
are there Git changes?

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.980
Am I in a Git repository at all?

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.380
Are there changes, et cetera?

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.780
Like all those little, every one of those is just,

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.740
oh, that's nice too.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.380
And it really adds up.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.820
- Well, and I've always been one to,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.700
I mean, for my career,

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.060
usually juggling multiple projects,

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.220
multiple branches on projects and everything.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.860
And I've kind of been okay knowing what I'm doing.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.020
However, recently I just have leveled up that

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.100
of using way more branches, way more projects,

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.580
and just having that information for me right there

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.220
to make sure that I know what version of Python I'm using,

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.260
what branch I'm on.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.900
And having that just ever present is like,

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.180
oh my God, I don't have to think about that anymore.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.260
Awesome, it's just right there.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.420
So I just hit that pain point

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.540
where having that information is helping me.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.420
And so I appreciate it.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.980
So yeah. - Very nice.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.180
- Cool. - Very nice.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.340
- How about any extras?

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.340
Do you have any extras for us?

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.740
- I'm feeling extra today.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.100
I got a few extras for folks.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.540
First of all, I spoke about UV,

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.860
or no, Brian, you spoke about UV and I just jumped on.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.700
We both wanted to talk about it,

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.180
but you had it first, I believe.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.020
- Yeah.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.980
- So it was officially your topic on the show.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.060
However, and you had Charlie Marsh on Testing Code.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.180
And so I just published an episode of Talk Python,

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.260
having a conversation with Charlie about UV

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.780
and a little bit of rough and just life in general.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.660
But I have a big backlog of shows over there

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.460
that I'm working to release

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.340
'cause I've recorded faster than weekly release cadence.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.580
But this one seemed very timely.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.540
So I put it to the front of the queue

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.980
so people can check that out.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.580
- I can't wait to listen to.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.580
- Yeah, it was fun.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.500
Also follow up here is

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.940
there's this really interesting YouTube channel.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.740
I don't know if it's in general interesting,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.500
just the one I watched is called Dark Matter.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.500
And they have like highly produced video versions

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.940
of what would be a podcast,

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.620
which is kind of interesting.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.500
So they had the one with David DHH

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.660
talking about the Leaving the Cloud, Cloud Fusion.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.060
But just like, if you look at the video side of it,

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.140
it's like, could be a documentary sort of thing.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.300
So anyway, that's interesting.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.140
We're checking out.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.020
You wanna follow up on all my Leaving the Cloud talk I did.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.540
For those who like to live out

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.100
near the front of the leading edge,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.740
Python 3.13 Alpha 5 is available

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.420
and people can go check that out.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.420
So it's not quite beta.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.500
And once it hits beta, there's no more changes,

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.140
but right now there's still potentially breaking changes.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.620
Things could be added, things could be removed, so on.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.860
But in this thing I'm linking to,

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.860
there's a nice list of what's some of the improvements.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.940
Like for example,

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.740
how exciting a preliminary experimental JIT was added,

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.300
by the way, just like throwing that out there

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.340
as if it's nothing.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.980
Your Python will be compiled.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.180
And then finally, this one comes to us from Pat Decker,

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.340
Target Tech.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.180
So the tech blog at Target.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.180
This is really cool.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.140
Said, "Target posted something on their blog,"

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.540
which I didn't know they had a tech blog,

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.260
so that's I guess news, but cool for them.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.340
"Announcing Target's open source fund."

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.620
- Oh, cool. - Yeah.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.660
And it says, "We created Target's open source fund

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.980
"as a commitment to support open source projects we use.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.660
"In short, Target now directly donates to projects

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.220
"through an internal process that prioritizes

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.340
"representation of Target's technology team."

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.500
Perfect, this is perfect.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.660
Like it says, look,

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.300
we're basing this on some of the prior work

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.500
that's out there, and in fact, the success of Sentry

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.060
and Microsoft's open source funds

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.060
have inspired them to go further.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.420
And then it lists projects like,

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.020
you just gave a shout out to Homebrew,

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.540
open API generator, SDK man,

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:55.540
MockK for Kotlin and HTTP 4K.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.060
So it looks like they do a lot of stuff with Kotlin.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.300
So they're supporting that, but whatever, right?

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.780
You support what you use.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.620
I think that's cool.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.940
- Yeah, I think, yeah, every company.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.180
I mean, every big company,

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.180
even companies you don't even think use open source

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.100
use open source, so.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.140
- Yes, exactly.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.020
Yeah, there was a quote they gave in here that said,

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.780
"The Linux Foundation estimates that 90% of the code

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.780
"in production is of open source origin."

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.220
Probably using libraries based on open source,

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.980
I would imagine.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.940
The fact you use Flask would make your stuff

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.740
of open source origin, I would imagine.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.860
- Yeah, and I know that there are some wrinkles

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.260
in how the money often gets distributed,

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.220
but some money getting distributed is better than none.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.780
So that's a good thing.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.380
- I'll say one more thing just to encourage other companies,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.340
people within other companies to do this.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.260
We recognize that it's our responsibility

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.220
to engage across a broad spectrum of activities.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.260
This includes contributing our own software to open source,

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.980
joining communities and patching software used by others,

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.740
plus funding with money the others they mentioned.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.580
That's pretty cool.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.420
- Yeah, cool.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.220
Well, the only extra I've got is that I have been working

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.900
on a side project that I'm starting to ramp up a little bit,

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.420
and I've decided to have a start in a SaaS project.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.980
And I've started, thought I would get a little headstart

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.580
by using Corey Zhu's SaaS Pegasus.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.540
So I talked with him just the other day.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.540
So his interview will be on Python test.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.020
But as I go along, I'll be reporting how it's going.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.020
And yeah, I'm just excited to get started.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.260
- Nice, you're gonna live blog it, blog the progress.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.860
- Yeah, it's just gonna be slow going

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.540
'cause there's a lot more going on in my life,

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.460
but I wanna get it off the ground.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.380
- Indeed.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.060
I know the feeling.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.180
- How about something funny?

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.860
- Yes, let's talk about something funny.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.020
So this comes to us from DevHumor,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.900
directly submitted by admin.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.540
It's got like a kind of a cybersecurity thing here, Brian.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.140
So like social engineering, like, hey, I'm from IT,

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.820
you're gonna get a pop-up on your authenticator

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.660
that says, we're just checking some systems.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.020
So if you don't mind just approving that.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.820
I know it's your personal email,

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.660
but we're just working on it for you.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.900
So anyway, here's the joke.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.020
If a person who tries to trick others

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.820
into giving them personal or sensitive information

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.500
is a social engineer, does that mean that the person

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.740
who tries to prevent that is an anti-social engineer?

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:31.220
- Well, I mean, I've met a lot of cybersecurity people

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.940
and I, maybe. (laughs)

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.260
I think it might be an overgeneralization, but yeah.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.780
- Yeah, it's funny.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.660
Anyway, are you an anti-social engineer?

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.060
This time it's a good thing.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.620
- I know just who I need to send this to.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.860
This is awesome.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.860
- Perfect.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.380
- Awesome, thanks.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.220
Well, that was a fun episode

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.700
and thank you everybody for listening and watching

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.300
and everything and thank you, Michael.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.140
- Yep, you bet.
