00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.200
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.760
headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.960
This is episode 388 recorded June 18th, 2024.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.960
I am Michael Kennedy.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.000
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.800
And this episode is brought to you by Scout APM.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.040
Check them out.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.080
We'll tell you more about them as we get further into the show.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.840
Brian, you, me, the podcast, we're all Fosstodonians and folks who want to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.120
come hang out on Mastodon.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.400
Doesn't have to be Fosstodon.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.680
Talked about that last week.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.240
That's the whole idea of Mastodon.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.520
Go wherever you want, but we're happy to invite you to Fosstodon if you want.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.280
Um, yeah, find the links to connect with us over there or even, even on X these

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.440
days as well, if you wish, a lot of people are still just hanging out over there.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.280
And listen, watch, participate live 10am Pacific time on Tuesdays, typically

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.320
links in the show notes or on the website.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.680
Finally, if you want a handcrafted artisanal Brian Okken special summary.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.920
And set a links of whatever we talk about.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.080
Even if you don't listen to that episode, pythonbytes.fm, click on the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.720
newsletter, put in your information.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.520
We won't share it.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.520
Just want to tell you about what we're up to and keep in touch with you.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520
So that's pretty awesome.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.680
That list keeps growing and people are enjoying it.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.040
So good work on that, Brian.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.280
There is a newsletter.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280
Like that's cool.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.760
Yeah.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.280
How about that?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.960
Nice.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.480
Yeah.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.880
Cool.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.600
We also kind of put it under the friends of the show thing, but that's a little

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.760
more indirect, you know, like I'd like, okay, click the newsletter, but you can

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.000
be a, you can sign up for the newsletter, even if you don't like us, that's fine.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.920
Yeah, that's true.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.280
Yeah.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.200
And just mock the links we make, we put in there every week.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.920
It's like pretty much the show too.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.920
That everyone's welcome.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.320
There probably are actually.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.880
All right.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.400
Well, what, what have you brought today?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.280
All right.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.000
I want to talk about the PSF election.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.760
So the Python Software Foundation has elections every year.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.480
In order to vote, we're going to talk about a little bit around what's going on

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.480
with this, but I want to highlight that you, even if you voted last year, you can't

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.440
just vote again without doing something.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.440
And it's not difficult.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.280
You just have to affirm your membership status.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.440
So we've got a link in the show notes.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.880
You just head up.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.720
We'll talk about the dates a little bit.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.520
I think maybe the dates are here.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.520
No, they're another, another link.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.320
We have lots of links for you for this, but there is the, what are we, what are we

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.960
doing?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.920
What are we voting on?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.520
We're voting on the new board of directors and, and then there's a few bylaws changes.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.480
So, so head over to the first link, make sure you're either signed up.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.320
So the deadlines are right around the corner.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.840
So it's 25th, June 25th is when you have to make either sign up to be a member.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.520
Or if you already are affirmed that you're going to vote.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.520
So that's the 25th.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.920
The, the board election, if you go to the board election, it's, there's a blog post

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.600
called it's time to make nominations for the PSF board election.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.880
It has the timeline.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.880
This is a great, it's got mostly all that I'm talking about here.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.000
Their nominations are open.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.200
They opened on the 11th.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.400
If you would like to be nominated or nominate somebody that is up until the 25th

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.960
of June.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.320
So the 25th of June is the close of board nominations.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.360
It's also the cutoff date to affirm that you're going to vote or eligible to vote

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.840
or whatever.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.160
So that's June 25th.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.400
Then the, then we don't know who's in it because the candidate it's still open.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.920
Other people can might enter.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.040
And there's links, there's information in here on like what to include, because you,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.400
you'll want some information about like who you are and stuff like that.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.880
If you want, if you want to nominate yourself.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.040
So the, the candidates are announced June 27th and then voting starts voting is from

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.800
July 2nd to July 16th.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.360
So voting's in July, but we need to get everything ready in the end of June.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.840
So that's what's going on here.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.520
So there's it's the nominations for the board of directors.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.880
And there's links about what's going on.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.480
Oh, there's, there's one other data I wanted to highlight.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.200
Can't remember where I found this, but there is a here it is.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.640
I'm thinking about running for the board of directors.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.400
Let's talk.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.120
There is a June 18th session that you can office hours where you can find out more

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.640
information.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.480
If you, if you're just curious, you'd like to know more.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.000
That's a great place to go.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.440
There is and then, so it's for the board of directors.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.680
And then there's there's also three bylaw changes proposed.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.880
I think that makes sense, but I'm not going to get into the depths of them, but

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.000
there's a link here.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.600
Go ahead and check that out about the three things.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.440
So one of the things that I'm really kind of excited about is this.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.560
The first one is merging, contributing and managing member classes.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.120
And I think that's, I think it makes sense because I sometimes I forgot which is

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.080
which, what contributing and managing means.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.280
I think there's text on all of these.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.640
So go ahead.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.080
Then there's discussions going on around this too.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.360
So anyway, elections coming up, make sure that you've affirmed your voter status if

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.400
you like to vote.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.520
So, okay.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.120
Interesting.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.680
Some of these shed some light on messages I've seen on social media.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.360
What, why are people talking about this?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.840
Oh, okay.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.200
I see.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.960
Proposed changes.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.200
Got it.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.600
Yeah.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.960
So, you know what I would propose Brian?

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.720
What?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.920
If you were working for a company and you were having HR issues, let's say, what

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.200
would you say exactly you do here?

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.920
Oh, Bob.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.360
No.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.640
Um, you're having HR issues.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.080
I'm a people person.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.280
I talk to the people.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.560
The engineers can't talk to the people.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.120
No.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.480
Yeah.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.040
Something like that.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.200
But anyway, if you were having issues with work and you got fired and you wanted

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.400
to give them the big middle finger on the way out.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.960
One thing I don't recommend is going to all the GitHub repositories and permanently

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.440
deleting them or deleting the logs or then replacing them with code that mocks the

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.520
existing employees or anything like that.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.360
There's this character at Boise.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.080
He, he seemed like a piece of work.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.720
Let me tell you.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.080
Mick Lewis, Daniel Brody, a real, real piece of work.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.280
Cloud, cloud engineer.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.520
I don't know what a cloud engineer is.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.280
I don't know what software developers are.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.960
I know what, anyway, he's a cloud engineer.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.280
He was sentenced to two years in prison and a restitution of over half a million

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.280
dollars for wiping the code repositories of his former employer in retaliation to

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.600
being fired from first Republic bank.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.240
Wow.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.720
Wow.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.560
So probably some kind of discrimination thing or, something he really

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.800
had a reason to be upset.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.200
No.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.680
Why was this guy fired?

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.280
The court documents state that Brody's employment was terminated after he

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.920
violated company policies by connecting a USB drive containing pornography

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.640
to the company computers.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.080
And then when they tried to get a work computer back, you know, after he's

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.280
done all this stuff to it, like, delete all the things and so on, he,

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.000
then reported the laptops, laptop stolen.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.520
I wouldn't give it back.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.600
Anyway.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.440
Um, he may be not having a great time.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.960
He, a couple of things he did.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.080
He ran a malicious script named dar.sh to wipe the FRB servers, deleted Git

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.760
logs and Git commit history for that particular script, you know, props to

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.480
him for a little covering of the tracks there with the Git history.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480
That was clever.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.760
Um, I don't know how they figured that out.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.520
Given that he...

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.000
Probably not too clever.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.400
Nah, exactly.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.160
Exactly.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.960
I mean, you delete the repo and you still get that figured out somehow.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.400
Anyway.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.280
Um, he accessed the GitHub repositories and deleted hosted code.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.120
He inserted taunts in the code.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.640
Um, yeah.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.520
Anyway, I just thought this was one, an amusing story, a little bit of schadenfreude.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.720
But also people, if you're upset with your company, it is not worth it.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.840
Two years of prison, half a million dollars.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.560
Just walk away.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.400
Just let it be.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.080
It's not worth it.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.960
A revenge.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.440
Anyway, let me leave you with that.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.920
Huh, Brian?

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.680
What do you think of this?

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.280
This is crazy.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.160
I think it is, but I also, one of the things I really, okay.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:22.560
I'm not like taking sides here or anything, but something that drives me nuts is a thing that some companies do that say that like, I, there's standard non-disclosure agreements for some, for exit interviews.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:31.000
And some of them are generally, you can't talk about what you worked on at this company for say, like a period of six months or a year or something like that.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.320
Um, just because you might have proprietary information.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:49.640
The thing that drives me nuts is things that say you can't, you can't, we're not going to give you any of your severance or a portion of your severance unless you promise to not ever disparage the company forever in the future.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.480
Um, things like that are just insidious and a, like a blight on free speech.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.680
I think it's disgusting.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.080
Yeah.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.160
Uh, I don't like it.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.640
I, I know it's a standard practice, but I don't like it.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.280
I don't like it either.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.120
I am really happy to hear the non-compete stuff getting shot down.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.200
I know it's not the same as NDA, but it's in the same category.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.400
I feel like like same.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.520
Do they do that for people getting fired?

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:25.320
No, no, no, not for, but you know, when you get hired, there's traditionally been a lot of non-competes and I think it's, it was getting kind of out of control, like bakery workers or something silly like that.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.600
Right.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.440
You know, like really, really, stuff that you wouldn't think would be under that purview.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.840
But I believe that I got federally shot down or is it just California?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:41.520
I can't remember, but yeah, anyway, maybe, maybe this kind of stuff you're talking about as well, but I don't have a ton of sympathy for this character.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.120
Yeah.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.680
No.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:50.520
It reminds me a little bit of the guy who, who, took down all the JavaScript folks with the NPM pad left pad.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.160
Yeah.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.000
And then later was arrested for making bombs.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.480
You know, it's like, well, there's that theme here.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:54.880
I see.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.640
Yeah.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.080
Not good.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.360
Yeah.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.480
I'm pretty sure that's the same person.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.520
There's definitely a person with the same name in the same area.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:00.960
Okay.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.840
Hey, you know, what is awesome and it's not going to get you into trouble.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.000
Scout APM.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.640
Let's talk about them.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:15.760
So if you are tired of spending hours trying to find the root cause of issues impacting your performance, then you owe it to yourself to check out Scout APM.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:25.040
They're a leading Python application performance monitoring tool, APM, that helps you identify and solve performance abnormalities faster and easier.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:38.320
Scout APM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks, slow database queries, background jobs, and the dreaded N plus one queries that you can end up if you do lazy loading in your ORM, then you say, oh no, why is it so slow?

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.640
Why are you doing 200 database queries for what should be one?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.000
So you can find out things like that.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:49.480
And it links it back directly to the source code so you can spend less time in the debugger and healing logs and just finding the problems and moving on.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.760
And you'll love it because it's built for developers by developers.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.240
It makes it easy to get set up.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.000
Seriously.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.840
You can do it in less than four minutes.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.640
So that's awesome.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.080
And the best part is the pricing is straightforward.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.280
You only pay for the data that used with no hidden overage fees or per seat pricing.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.680
And I just learned this, Brian.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.840
They also have, they provide the pro version for free to all open source projects.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:21.200
So if you're an open source maintainer and you want to have Scout APM for that project, just shoot them a message or something on their pricing page about that.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.200
So you can start your free trial and get instant insights today.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.000

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.080
The link is in your podcast player show notes as well.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.440
And please use that link.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.000
Don't just search for them because otherwise they don't think you came from us and then they'd stop supporting the show.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.640
So please use our link, pythonbytes.fm/scout.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.560
Check them out.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.480
It really supports the show.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.240
Indeed.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.200
Brian, what's your second one?

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.280
I'd like to talk about imports right now.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.200
So if we're just importing a package,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.400
Just like tariffs and stuff.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:54.960
What are we talking?

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.880
No, no, no.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.680
Importing code into your own code.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.960
So imports are normally difficult.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.320
You just say import and the package name you want to import.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.960
No, no.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:10.360
The package has to be installed already or a standard library thing, of course, like import math or something.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.880
I'm blanking right now.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.520
It's terrible.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:21.920
But there is a blog post called Adam Johnson, which is talking about like, what if you don't want to just use the import?

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.840
If you want to import it as an object or something.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.160
And let's say you have a string to describe the package that you want to import.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.400
There's a thing that I didn't know about called packageutil.resolvename.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.680
And this is actually pretty cool.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.960
So what you do is it's in packageutil as part of the standard library.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.560
And you say packageutil.resolvename.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.600
And then you give it a string.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:53.720
And it's got it's like it's like a package name that is also something that's installed or in something in it, like a top level item.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:59.240
Like the example is pathlib and capital path, the path object.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:06.880
But I tried it on one of my own projects of just like, let's say I've got some third party code that I want to import just something from it.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.840
But I don't want to import it into the namespace.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.120
I want to just import one thing out of there into an object.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.200
And this is really cool.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.400
The whole thing resolves and it's from a string.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.920
So you give it a string with this colon in the middle and it creates it.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.240
It creates you've got an object.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.960
Why is this helpful?

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:33.640
Well, one of the I don't know how other people are using it, but I'm using it for things like testing and stuff that I don't want to like clutter the entire namespace.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.320
I just want one object from something.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.840
So so there's that.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:49.960
Now, there's a note here that says the thing that you're importing, importing can be it can be a class from the package or a function or module or really any top level thing object within the package.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.120
You can just resolve that and bring it in.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:58.000
If you're doing if you're going to grab the whole module, you can also use import lib import module.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.160
Of course, you can use that as well to import a thing.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
And it's a little bit different syntax.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.800
You just give it the give it the name of the package.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:15.640
So there was a note at the top that says Django and some other frameworks allow you to do things like this to configure something based on a string.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.040
And I think this is pretty cool.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.720
I'm one of the places where I'm considering.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.840
Yeah, anyway, I've got lots of places and tests that I'm considering using this, but but I guess I didn't know about it.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.440
That's pretty neat.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:35.840
So, you know, one area that might be useful, it comes to mind outside of testing or in addition to testing would be some kind of like plug in extension system.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:42.000
So you say any any package that gets listed in this JSON file, we want it to be available.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.560
And if you configure the app, it'll actually import it and use it.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.120
But it might not import them.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.440
The app doesn't know about them.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.720
That can't be coded into it.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:56.480
So you could just sort of parse that thing, try it or, you know, even scan all the packages somehow and see if they exist or whatever.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:56.640
Right.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.960
So some sort of dynamic thing like that as well.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.360
Yeah.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.040
Yeah.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.960
Pulling doc strings out of a bunch of stuff to do a list of that might be.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.200
Yeah.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:05.440
Nice.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.000
Anyway, lots of stuff you could do.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.080
And you sure could.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:16.840
Now, this last item for me here comes from Alex on a hand, just gave us a shout out and said, you know, that duck DB thing, right?

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:26.480
Duck TV is a little bit like SQL lite ish type stuff and in process based on files rather than separate servers, all those sort of things.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.600
Well, that thing's getting some traction up to 4 million downloads a month off of PI PI.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:37.520
But the news is it's released version 1.0 of duck TV.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.320
And by the way, the cloud hosted product, mother duck also opened up general availability.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.120
But the news is the announcing a 1.0.0.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.600
And interesting.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:57.600
There's a lot of conversations like, well, we could have just called it one zero as soon as we made it public on GitHub, you know, 10 years ago or whatever it was, or not quite 10 years ago, eight years ago.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.120
But focus is really on, we want to make it super clear.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.640
They want to make it super clear that they're focused on stability.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.080
What's here is kind of what's going to stay.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:19.960
So examples that they give, or, you know, as that thing has evolved, as duck DB has evolved, they've changed the file format around and that's created incompatibilities from different versions.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:28.160
And so, for example, they're now committing to more stable back and forth, stability on the file system and things like that.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.480
So very cool.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:38.000
If you're looking for an interesting SQL like database to include into your projects, this one, you know, it's.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:45.960
Quite popular, 20,000 stars, really analytical and process database rather than relational database focused.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.360
Right.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:46.720
Yeah.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.480
You can do cool stuff like integrate it with pandas and other things like that, which is pretty cool.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:51.720
Yeah.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.600
Like for example, select star from a parquet file or a CSV file and so on.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:02.400
So not meant to replace SQL light, but as that's kind of the mental model people should have, but more on data science.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.840
Select star from a CSV file.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.880
That sounds fun.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:12.800
And by the way, this guy, Alex, Alex Monahan is in the audience says here's a backwards compatibility, for the files.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:27.400
So you can just leave those files around and not have to like manage the upgrades of them and so on, which is especially tricky if they're just local files associated with an app rather than a single server that all the apps talk to where you can just manage that one thing, you know, through an API.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:27.840
Yeah.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.360
Pretty cool.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:28.800
Cool.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.240
All right.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.200
Thanks for sending that in Alex and good job, duck DB folks.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.560
Brian, what else you got?

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.240
I've got a couple extras.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:45.640
Um, one of the extras that I wanted to talk about was, just, it's just like a, I guess a shout out to everybody that sends us, sends us topics.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.720
I really appreciate it.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.760
We, we appreciate hearing what's new.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:54.040
Don't assume that we've heard about it just because we do pay attention to a lot of stuff, but there's a lot to pay attention to.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.080
So if you think it's important, let us know.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:56.640
Yeah.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:56.840
Right.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:02.680
And I would say a lot of times people start messages like you, you, I'm sure you've heard of this and we're like, I have no idea what this is.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.040
No.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.040
I'm sure we have not heard of this.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:05.800
Sure.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:11.720
We have not covered it either, but also it helps if like three or four people send in to say, this is exciting.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.000
Then that also helps us know that it is exciting.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.320
Yeah.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.240
It's pretty much guaranteed to be in on the show.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:31.440
You can send it in any time, but the one request is if it's timely and it really needs to go in this week, if it shows up at all, I'm trying to send it before Tuesday because, you know, sometimes we already have our topics.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.440
Anyway, that's right.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.920
So right after Tuesday, a Wednesday is a fantastic day for recommendations.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.280
Really?

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:45.440
Anytime is great for me, but anyway, so, a couple new, 2.0 releases.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.360
I just wanted to shout out.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.120
We talked about this last week, but a NumPy 2.0 is out now.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.240
So NumPy 2.0.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:57.960
So, and there's a, scientific on the scientific Python blog, there's a, discussion about it.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.240
So you can read up on all the NumPy 2.0.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.200
And this is kind of exciting.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.480
I just heard about this yesterday.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.960
HTMX 2.0.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.840
I don't have my attention.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:14.240
So I haven't read any of this, but it should be some, there's a major changes and we'll see.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.880
Um, I'm not sure what broke or what, why the 2.0, but I'm not sure I can switch to this.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.520
This release ends the support for internet Explorer.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.360
Oh my gosh.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.280
Just kidding.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:39.480
The interesting bit about this though, is they're not marking a 2.0 is the latest on the NPM until January of 2025, because they'd like to have everybody, you know, have a smooth transition to there.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.120
So anyway, any extras on your side?

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.000
A few, first of all, partnered with the folks over at PyCharm.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.480
And now if you are taking a course at DocPython training, you can get six months of PyCharm Pro for free.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.560
That even works for our free courses.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.640
So if you just come over and take a course, sign up and check that out.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.480
Only works for new accounts at JetBrains.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.640
It doesn't work for renewal.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:10.240
So can't, I'm that this is the best I can do folks, but it's still pretty awesome to be able to get a good chunk of the users free access to PyCharm Pro.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:17.240
Uh, also other item is we have a awesome new course on data science coming to DocPython.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.840
It's release is imminent.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.640
It awaits a marketing landing page basically.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.720
And then it, then it's out.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:30.840
So we have a new course called reactive web dashboards with shiny, shiny for Python, not shiny for R.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:41.080
So partner with the Posit folks to put this course together and it's super cool to build interactive dashboards and web apps for your data science things with shiny.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.600
Shiny course.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.080
Very cool.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.440
Indeed.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.080
Very, it's a shiny brand new course.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:46.400
All right.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.360
It will be shiny for a while.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.200
How about a joke?

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.840
Are you up for it?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.560
Yes.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.160
Okay.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:59.000
So we all, you know, you're sitting around, you're in a relationship, you have these thoughts that just kind of run through your head and you always don't know.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
So here's, here's a young couple laying in bed.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.120
The woman is thinking, I bet he's thinking about another woman.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.440
That guy is just laying there.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.000
What happened if I add a git ignore into the git ignore file?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.360
I just like, she's giving him way too much credit.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.040
What would happen?

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.920
I know the title is I can't ignore the git ignore.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.520
What would happen if I had the git ignore to the git ignore file?

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.480
No.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.320
Well, there's the joke.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.800
This is what I got for you, Brian, this week.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.960
I don't want to tell you.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.800
Now I've got to try it to see.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.560
Exactly.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.280
I don't know.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.360
If you do that, you might take GitHub down.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.040
I wouldn't, I don't know if I'd check that in.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.160
Well, not GitHub, but local.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.960
Well, I mean, it has automation.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.000
It could explode.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.400
It could.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:44.920
It could.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.320
Dependabot will just stop working for everyone after that.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.440
Yeah.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.440
All right.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:49.680
All right.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.920
Well, that's it.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.960
Well, everyone, thank you for listening.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.800
Scout APM.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.920
Thank you for supporting the show and Brian.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.640
Thanks as always.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.240
Thank you.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.240
Thanks as always.
