00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.020
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.300
This is episode 82, recorded June 13th, 2018.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.260
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.200
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.580
And we have, I think, quite a big episode.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.600
I'm sure people have heard about this thing with GitHub.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.540
What do you think?

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.800
Yeah, I think so, probably.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.780
It's definitely when the news about Microsoft buying GitHub came out, it definitely made some waves.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.780
So we're going to talk about that.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.800
Before we do, though, let's say thanks to DigitalOcean.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.540
DigitalOcean is sponsoring this episode and many of the Python Bytes ones.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.660
So check them out at pythonbytes.fm/DigitalOcean and get $100 credit, which is pretty awesome.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.860
So we'll do the GitHub conversation at the end.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.800
We'll focus on that.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.280
But Brian, you got something about documenting REST APIs first?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.960
Yeah, so there's Doug Farrell.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.480
I think we've highlighted one of someone's writing before.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.260
I'm not sure.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.420
But I definitely remember the name.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:06.580
But he wrote on the RealPython site an article called Building and Documenting Python REST APIs with Flask and Connection.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:15.180
So one of the things, as you know, I've been playing with a little command line application on testing code.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.500
But I wanted to add a REST API.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.560
And so this caught my eye.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.160
And I had also heard of Swagger.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.500
So this is one of the things that I like about this article.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.540
It talks about, first of all, it doesn't assume that you already know what you're doing, which is nice.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.000
It does talk about what REST is and what REST isn't.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.440
It has a nice explanation of REST and how that works with web APIs.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.640
And then I know a lot of people are, I think a lot of people use Swagger as a definition.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.520
It's a YAML definition language to define what your API connections are.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.320
And so this article uses that.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.580
And then also it's to implement a little CRUD application.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.640
And then I had never heard of this connection module or package.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.380
And there's a...

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.840
Yeah, connection with an X.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.500
Yeah.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.000
Yeah.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.120
So connection that takes a Swagger file and helps you to implement the API with Flask.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.880
And it's just a fairly brief read, but I haven't done the demo yet, but I'd like to.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:36.420
And one of the things that Swagger gives you, if you're familiar with Swagger, is that if you use it, you automatically get these cool user interfaces for your API that humans can read.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.560
And they can...

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.600
So it's kind of a self-documenting API system.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.240
So taking advantage of that is nice.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.180
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.100
I definitely have heard of Swagger.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.180
And I think Swagger is pretty cool.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.980
I've checked it out some for some of the APIs I've done.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.560
I've never heard of connection.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.640
It's like...

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.840
So basically, you give it your Swagger file and just say, yeah, do that.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.020
And it more or less does, huh?

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.740
That's pretty cool.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.300
Yeah.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.200
And then...

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.760
And there...

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.140
I mean, there's some pieces left over that you have to, like, tie everything together.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.120
So this article goes through that.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.300
And one of the nice things also that I...

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.980
I've seen a lot of REST API tutorials that kind of leave the ending.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.980
Then you just have, like, a REST API with nothing using it.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.160
This article finishes it up with a web application that uses the API to...

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.100
With some JavaScript plugging into it.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.080
So it talks about that.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.860
Which is good.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.500
Because I wanted to play with this.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.420
But I'm really not a...

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.440
I'm not a JavaScript person.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.380
So having somebody write that for me so I can play with it.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.940
That's cool.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.280
Yeah.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.640
Thanks, Doug, for saving Brian all the work.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.640
Yeah.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:48.600
And it turns out that a connection comes from Zalando, which is the largest online fashion platform in Europe.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.640
I actually had them on Talk Python a while back, which is interesting.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.660
I didn't put those two together.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.920
Although I'm pretty sure we talked about that, like, two years ago and I just forgot.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.780
Zalando.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.540
I like that name.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.900
Cool.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.200
Yeah.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.760
It's pretty cool.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.580
I'm probably mispronouncing it, actually.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.320
But that's all right.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.580
That's pretty standard fare for our podcast, right?

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.900
Yeah.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.820
Yeah.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.200
Nice.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.880
Yeah, that's a good pick.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.080
I really like it.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.780
I think Doug's article is well done.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.060
And it's super thorough.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.900
So, yeah, if you're looking to get into writing APIs with Flask, then this is worth checking out.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.520
And certainly the swagger connection aspect is kind of unique, I think.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.840
Yeah.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.560
So mypy, that's Guido Von Rossum's main project, as far as I can tell right now.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.000
Him and some folks from Dropbox are working on mypy, which is a static type checker for Python, right?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.300
Yeah.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.040
That's pretty cool.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.300
Yeah.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.400
They haven't heard much about it yet or recently.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.220
Yeah.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.380
They're still doing stuff on it, as far as I can tell.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.280
And it's coming along.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:49.800
The big news that I got for this next item is there's now a plugin for PyCharm for mypy, which is pretty cool.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.180
So you're like in your PyCharm project, you hit a hotkey, and then you just get full mypy type checking.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.640
Okay.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.320
That's cool.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.000
Yeah.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.580
I like that.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.060
Yeah.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.580
That's pretty awesome.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.520
So, yeah, this is by Ivan Levkinvitsky.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.180
See?

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.940
What did I say about this?

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.360
So, yeah.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.800
Thanks, Ivan.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.600
This is really awesome, and it's great.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.620
So, Ricky Tici asked, you know, what on Twitter, I linked to the conversation, says, you know,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.720
like, PyCharm already has type checking, right?

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.080
So if you pull it up, it'll say, hey, you're calling this function, and it's using it wrong,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.500
or you're trying to pass an int, and it takes a string, or vice versa.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.000
It says, well, why would I care about this plugin into PyCharm, which already does that kind of stuff?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.740
So, Ivan had a few bits of feedback.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.640
He said, well, mypy is a little bit more strict and precise than PyCharm.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:47.780
It's a lot more configurable with rules, and it type checks the entire program, like, all at once, not just, you know, what's loaded in your project.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.880
So that's pretty cool.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:06:00.420
And then sometimes people use mypy as part of a continuous integration path, and you might want to run mypy quickly before you do a push, just to know what the outcome will actually be.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.820
So, you know, hotkey, and then you commit.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.380
Pretty sweet.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.780
Yeah, I'll have to check that out.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.180
It's nice.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.720
Yeah, I've been pretty much just leaning on the PyCharm type validation whenever I use it.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:23.980
But I can certainly see projects where mypy has lots of value, and it's still my working theory that the reason they're so heavily working on it at Dropbox is they're trying to use mypy to convert to Python 3 safely, maybe even automatically.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.480
Okay.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.960
Well, speaking of automatic.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.600
That's my working theory based on no data other than outside observation.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.760
Was that, like, a really cool segue that I just missed?

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.200
Yeah.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.640
Okay.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.760
So I've got, like, what if you had, like, a tool that could just automatically upgrade for you?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.880
That would be fantastic.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.760
I know that there's, so there's a 2 to 3 already, but it's fairly non-invasive, the 2 to 3.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.580
I think Python still ships with that, doesn't it?

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.600
I think so.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.220
Yeah, I think so.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.260
And I've used it a couple times, but it's pretty conservative.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.420
It's basically to get you over the hump from 2 to 3.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.580
But what if you want to go, like, farther?

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:09.200
And you want to, like, one of the things that I want to do is I want to take some of the code I was using prior to Python 3.6

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.380
and be able to convert some of the strings to f-strings because they're nicer to read.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.020
And this will do it for me.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.820
I found a tool called PyUpgrade.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:27.160
And it's a tool, and it also can be a pre-commit hook that automatically upgrades your syntax to new versions of the language.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.060
And it does all sorts of stuff, not just f-strings.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.680
And the f-strings also is optional, so it doesn't do it by default.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.060
Like, if you're converting to Python 3.5, don't do that.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.800
Yeah, it'll crash.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.040
But, for instance, the set literals have changed.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.440
You can have an easier-to-read set literal syntax.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.640
Also, dictionary comprehensions and some things like that.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.060
The Unicode's changed a little bit.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.780
And, yeah, anyway, being able to automatically do that is pretty fun.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.820
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:02.300
And 2 to 3 is make it run on Python 3, whereas this looks like make it embrace Python 3.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.140
Yeah, definitely.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:08.780
And, yeah, dictionary comprehensions are just awesome, so you may as well use the better syntax.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.760
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.580
And then you have another one for documentation, right?

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.960
Yeah, since this was a pretty short little thing, I thought I'd go along with this.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.960
And we've all heard of black, and we've talked about it a few times on the show.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.540
But an extension to this is blacken docs.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:32.100
So it runs black on your REST and RST and Markdown files.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.220
For any of the code examples inside of there, it makes sure that those are blackened also.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.360
So that's fun.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.120
That's pretty awesome.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.940
You've got maybe like a little bit of demo code for your project that shows how to use it,

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.880
and that's in your documentation.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.800
You could blacken it, and boom, it's formatted like the rest of your code, right?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.220
I think blackened docs also, I was thinking it runs as a pre-commit hook,

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.780
but I'm not sure if it does or not.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.840
And that's, actually, I don't think we've talked about pre-commit,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.780
so maybe that's for another time.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.880
Yeah, yeah, let's talk about that.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.440
But definitely, so, you know, sort of as part of your GitHub check-in, just magic happens.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:06.960
Yeah.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.880
Or your git check-in.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.620
Yeah, awesome.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.560
All right, speaking of awesome, DigitalOcean, they're pretty awesome,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.180
both as an infrastructure provider and for supporting the show.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.280
So you can go from zero to a running server in about 60 seconds.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.180
They have a bunch of cool different types of servers.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.540
They even have one-click apps.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.360
You want a ghost blog server on Linux, press a button, you know, 30, 40 seconds later,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.600
you have it all set up and running.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.040
Super nice.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.000
So we've talked about Python.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So we've talked about legacy Python.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.580
So we've talked about legacy Python.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.800
And I believe that that original terminology of legacy Python was from a digital platform.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.360
And then check them out.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.260
All of our stuff is running on it.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.920
At least all the Python bytes and my things are running on it, which has been super flawless,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.900
like super happy customer and going to continue to be.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.980
And if you want to be as well and get a credit, check them out, pythonbytes.fm/digitalocean.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.540
So we've talked about Python and we've talked about legacy Python.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:03.600
And I believe that that original terminology of legacy Python was from Matthias Poussigny,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.980
who is from the Jupyter Project.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.400
Actually, I had him back on episode 44 of Talk Python.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:15.220
And he's part of this project called python3statement.org.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.860
So this was sent over by Bruno Alla.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.840
Thank you for that, Bruno.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:27.340
And the idea is to have these projects make a public statement of dropping support for legacy Python sooner.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:27.860
Yeah.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.660
And we've seen that for some projects already, right?

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.400
Yeah, that's right.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.040
And you'll see, you can go there and you can see the ones that are listed.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.480
So they say they now have 44 projects that are pledged to drop legacy Python in less than 30 months.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.840
And some already have, which is awesome, like Django, for example.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.080
I don't know if Django is even listed there, but they should be.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.220
Maybe they didn't make a pledge, but they did it.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:53.400
Anyway, it basically shows you various projects that are committing to it.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.440
And the main motivation is like we have tools and we have techniques to support legacy Python.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.100
But at the same time, it's like a small but constant friction

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.640
on newcomers, on adding new features.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.700
And you just have to keep making sure your code works, right?

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.520
Like when, I think it was Django, when they switched to Python 3 only,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.080
they were able to drop a bunch of code and actually get smaller and have less to maintain.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.460
So that's pretty awesome.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.440
They say over there on their site, they say they're keen to see Python 3 reach its full potential.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:32.220
And they think that they don't want to, you know, they're happy to have these projects support Python 2 to help smooth that transition, but not forever.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:32.740
Right?

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:39.800
And actually, one of the things I like about the site is they have a really nice why switch to Python 3 with like articles from say Brett Cannon and other folks.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.320
It's pretty cool.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.360
It also has a timeline, a visual timeline that you can see the different projects that are signed up for this.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.020
Oh, that's nice.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:46.900
And when they're...

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.500
So this seems pretty heavily dominated by the data science crowd.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:57.100
And I think that's because the folks that put the Python 3 statement.org together are data science people.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.760
And they just have, you know, greater interactions and leverage on those projects.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.980
So I'd like to see other projects like, you know, Django could come and be part of this and it would take them zero effort.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.740
Right?

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.060
Because they're already doing that in Django 2 and things like this.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.580
So, yeah, I just want to encourage people if they have a project to go over there and make a statement.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.000
I'd like to see more projects do that, too, because there's a lot that I utilize that aren't on here.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.480
But there's...

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.240
And they make it real easy.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.320
You can either...

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.660
They said that they've got a GitHub issue tracker.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.760
You can just submit an issue with your project information and have somebody else do it.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.140
Or you can submit a pull request on this tool to pull in the information.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.540
So both those are cool ideas.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.460
So no reason to not do it.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.020
That's right.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.200
I definitely love it.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.140
Soon we will speak of Legacy Python in the past.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.260
Well, there's an elephant in the room.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:44.880
It is.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.000
Don't you mean a really giant octopus cat thing?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.820
Octopus cat thing?

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.660
Yeah, the Octocat.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.840
That's the logo of GitHub.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.200
Okay.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:53.840
Okay.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.520
Got it.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.080
Forgot about the cat part of it.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.400
So...

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:56.560
Yeah.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.380
The head is a cat and the bottom is an octopus.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:58.920
I don't know.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.600
You know, it's a pretty non-standard sort of creature.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.820
But it's like a platypus, but it's the cat octopus version.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.200
Okay.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.860
It is definitely big news.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:13.320
And I think the Twitter was blowing up with people both somewhat cautiously optimistic,

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.220
I'd say, and two totally freaked out.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:23.160
And that is that Microsoft has paid or agreed to pay $7.5 billion for GitHub.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.140
Yeah, that's a lot of money.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.060
It is a lot of money.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:31.300
When I first heard about that, I was a little bit on the slightly negative side of things.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.540
Like, oh man, really?

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:38.820
The more I've looked into it, the more I feel like this is probably a positive thing.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.580
So you and I haven't really had a chance to talk about this.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.240
You've been like hanging out of the Eiffel Tower and stuff like that.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.880
Yeah.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.240
So this is our first chance we get to chat.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:47.640
Yeah.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.060
So tell me, what's your thought on this?

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.140
Well, like you, I was a little bit on the negative side at first.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.340
And then actually you shared with me an article called

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.000
Everyone Complaining About Microsoft Buying GitHub Needs to Offer a Better Solution.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.300
And it's not just a glib article.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.040
It's actually a nice article that talks about some of the history.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.660
One of the reasons why I like it, it talks about it from the GitHub side

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.500
of saying really GitHub needed to go somewhere.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.540
So it was still, I didn't know that GitHub was taking VC funding

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.300
and didn't have a good roadmap ahead of it to,

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:29.840
or at least there's a speculation is there wasn't a sound model to continue.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.240
Because the way GitHub makes, I mean, GitHub spends money in it clearly,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.620
but it makes money on the enterprise side.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:40.160
And it kind of makes sense to have, so this article talks about the three potential,

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.460
it makes sense to have it be bought or to, and to be bought by somebody that already has

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.960
ties into enterprise, have an enterprise sales staff and stuff like that.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.560
So the, it said potentials were really Microsoft, Amazon, or Google.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.920
I think that's what it listed.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.140
Yeah, pretty much.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:57.640
Yeah.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.560
And that makes sense.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.940
And I, from that standpoint, so on the, on the side of like being able to sell enterprise,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.320
GitHub enterprise, those three totally would make sense.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.740
And so I actually, after reading that, I'm like, actually, I would have been okay with

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.760
like any of those people buying it.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.580
But Microsoft is not, is not the evil empire that it used to be.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.360
So I guess, I guess I'm kind of okay with it.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.500
So how about you?

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.680
That's sort of where I came around to as well.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.580
I did a lot of looking into this, a lot of research when the first few days when this

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:32.540
was out to sort of figure out, okay, I have a gut reaction, but how should I feel about

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:32.660
it?

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.900
Like, I didn't realize how much trouble GitHub was actually in.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:43.520
Like they have been, like they went like six months or something without a CEO at all.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.340
Cause they just couldn't find one, which is not super encouraging.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.360
They took tons of VC money.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.640
There's a really interesting retweet, a self retweet.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.160
It's not like a, a selfie tweet.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.600
I don't know.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:55.880
Whatever.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.640
David Hanna-Meyer Hansen retweeted himself when this news came out and he tweeted something

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:08.740
that he wrote when GitHub first took VC money back in 2012, said, I love the GitHub product

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:09.300
to bits.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.060
We're proud paying customers.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.400
And I hope they figure out how to disarm this VC time bomb before it blows up.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.560
That's what he said in 2012.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:22.640
So of course, 2018, GitHub's time bomb has exploded right on time with the sale of the

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.940
Microsoft, the sales of Microsoft.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:30.740
And I think, you know, when you take VC money, it's not okay to just be doing all right, right?

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.660
You got a 10 exit.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:37.420
And if you're not 10 X in it, something's going to happen like a sale or, you know, if

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.500
it's going really great, it's an IPO.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.140
If it's not going super great, it's some kind of sale and acquisition.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.540
And, you know, they sort of went down that path.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.240
You know, maybe GitHub wouldn't be what it is today if it weren't for that VC money.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.820
But it does sound like something had to happen.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.780
They had, so they had this sort of VC pressure.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.640
They had, you know, financial pressure.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.700
They had the sort of organizational stuff with like not be able to find a CEO.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.680
There's a guy who was a CEO, Chris, I forgot his last name.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.960
Sorry.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.120
Who was the CEO in turn.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.160
Then he stepped down and they became the CEO again.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.300
And they stepped back down.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.840
And so now Nate Friedman is going to be the CEO.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.800
He's the co-founder of Xamarin, which is pretty awesome.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.080
Yeah.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:21.140
And I think if you look at Microsoft's history of acquiring companies and either making them

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.140
awesome or making them not awesome, it's a mixed bag a little bit.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:25.460
All right.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:30.160
So for example, under the not awesome category, people have put Skype.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:36.120
I think, I don't know, Skype was actually having some issues as well, but it's Skype seems to

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.780
always be changing and never amazing.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.640
Like it doesn't ever stabilize on a UI.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.160
It's just always like, why is this hard?

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.720
Wait, it's differently hard now.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.400
Now it's hard in a different way, but anyway, so like that's one example of not so great.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.820
But I think an example of really them shepherding something pretty well is Xamarin, right?

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.880
Xamarin was a big open source way to build mobile apps on C#.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.540
And Xamarin did a lot with bringing .NET to Linux.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.640
So they bought them and I think they're still doing pretty well as independent organizations.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.520
So it's a bit of a mixed bag.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.860
I feel like taking care of a developer space is better than other tools.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:16.200
And like regarding the Skype thing, although the interface might be all weird and occasionally

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.920
I still rely on it and it's still there.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.720
I would rather have it be there than disappear without an owner if that was the other option.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.540
Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.840
I know one of the fears is what's going to change with GitHub.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:37.700
And I think it's big enough and in everybody's face enough that I don't think they're going to make major changes right away because they're under a microscope.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.820
And they always will be.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.960
I think the other thing is you got to look at where Microsoft is the last three or four years in terms of what their priorities are, right?

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.740
We got Sachin Nadella who's doing pretty good stuff.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:56.360
But mostly what I mean is it used to be how can we make this jammed into some sort of lock in for Windows?

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.780
How can we make it like some kind of thing for Office you have to do?

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.020
You know, things like that.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.180
Whereas lately it's always it's all about Azure, Azure, Azure.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.880
How can we get people to use Azure?

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.740
And Azure is their cloud stuff, right?

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.720
It doesn't matter if you use Python or .NET or Linux or Node.js or whatever, right?

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:22.520
So I feel like there's not going to be pressure to, say, push people to one of their languages or something like that.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.120
But there probably will be like up sales to Azure.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.660
And, hey, if you get GitHub Enterprise, you get a certain amount of Azure credits.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.440
So you get like brought into that world.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.240
I think that that's the angle.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.920
And I don't think there's going to be a lot of negative pressure because of it, right?

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.580
Like I can resist an Azure ad just as much.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.680
I can resist all the other ones.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.260
I don't really care.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.680
But if they, you know, said, well, it only really like GitHub really only works well if you use Visual Studio.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.940
Like that would be super bad.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.700
I don't think that that is even in their interest as they see it these days.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:57.480
So I feel like it's probably going to be okay unless they screw something up on accident.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.520
I don't see that they'll screw it up on purpose.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.820
As the community noted, you can always switch to GitLab if you want.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.240
You can.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:03.620
Yeah.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.220
Yeah.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.180
I was amused by that and also pleased.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.480
I didn't, I don't.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.300
At first there were people going, there's like a mass, mass exodus out of GitHub into GitLab.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:24.040
And although the imports from GitHub to GitLab are going up dramatically, it's really kind of a drop in the bucket for how many projects are on GitHub.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.900
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:30.080
But I do like that there's some discussion to say, hey, everybody, GitLab is not that bad.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:39.500
I've used GitLab and I actually kind of like that this has highlighted the fact that it's not bad for something to be in GitLab, even if you're trying to get people to contribute.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.360
It's pretty much the same process.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.040
So it doesn't really matter too much.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.740
Yeah, that's cool.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.980
So in summary, you're sort of like summarizing my feelings.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.920
Like I'm kind of like genuinely cautiously optimistic.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.840
I think Microsoft brings tons of resources to GitHub and maybe GitHub will be more awesome.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.160
They're going to keep running as an independent organization.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.900
They've got somebody who's pretty awesome leading it.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.200
So these are all good things.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:03.660
Yeah.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.780
We've got the Linux Foundation actually said something pretty surprising.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:14.140
So they wrote up an official thing on it after a few days and said, Microsoft's GitHub buy is a win for open source.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:25.420
And one of the guys there who's been, I forgot his name, has been super anti-Microsoft sort of said, look, these are all the reasons why this is good and I'm happy for it, which is surprising, I suppose.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:25.980
That's cool.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:37.240
And then also Nat Friedman did an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit where there was quite a few questions and answers on like what's going to happen and things like that.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.320
Yeah, that's cool.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.740
There's Atom also.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.740
Like how does Atom and code, they're kind of overlapping.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.300
So they'll keep both of those, things like that.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.300
Yeah, that's encouraging.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:54.800
And it's also interesting that VS Code is based on Electron.js, which was extracted out of Atom, right?

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.440
So Electron.js used to be called Atom Shell.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.440
Okay, interesting.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.360
Yeah, in its early days.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:00.680
Yeah.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:08.420
So one thing I do want to throw out there for people who want to dig into this a little bit more is this podcast called Exponent.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.620
It's one of my absolute favorite podcasts actually.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:23.240
And the guys there, they basically do tech business analysis and they did a really nice job of looking at the sort of motivation and the pluses and negatives of Microsoft buying GitHub.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.760
So I would link to that in the show notes, episode 154.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.220
Yeah, I listened to that.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:27.600
It was good.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:39.100
The one thing I thought was interesting is nobody's really mentioned the, to me, the obvious truth that Microsoft would just rather be the owner of GitHub than have any of its competitors be the owner of GitHub.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.560
I think that's real and legitimate.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.320
I agree.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:51.840
And one other, like I had said my positive, the negative that I somehow forgot to tie together there was the thing that made me just go, I'd rather not see this.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:23:00.560
Even at the beginning was this is such a consolidation of a really major tech player, right?

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.560
We already have so many things being sucked into Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:12.520
And there was like this nice independent place that wasn't any particular technology stack at all.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.880
It was just GitHub.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:20.360
You could go there and you could build your software and they didn't try to encourage you to use Ruby or whatever it was, right?

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.220
There's just like that was a place where the code goes.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.720
And now there's a less of that in the world.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.320
And I think that's a negative.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:26.820
Yeah.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.700
There's still GitLab.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.440
There's still GitLab.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:28.840
That's true.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.320
Yeah.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.860
There's definitely, I mean, there's also Atlassian Bitbucket, right?

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.960
So that's another possibility as well.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:38.400
But I think GitHub still is a special place for social coding and open source collaboration.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.520
And I don't think it's going to change.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.700
It'll change if they muck it up.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.100
And yeah, so we're a pretty fickle group.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.500
But I think they know that.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.560
But we've seen, yeah, like we've already hashed.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.640
Microsoft is a different company towards open source than it used to be.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:53.980
All right.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.660
Well, that's our thoughts.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:00.620
If you have your own thoughts, feel free to put them in the show notes at pythonbytes.fm

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.580
slash 82.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.140
And just go to the discuss section down at the bottom.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:04.960
All right.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.940
That's it for our news.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.340
Brian, you got any extra stuff you want to chat about?

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.660
No, not really.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:16.720
Other than I did figure out how to bring home a over 100-year-old Venetian glass chandelier

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.640
on an airplane.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.560
That was fun.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.440
That's insane.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.260
Can I get a bulkhead seat?

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.660
My chandelier needs to have a little room to breathe.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.860
Yeah, I had to take the thing apart and put it in bubble wrap and put it in two suitcases.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.760
Oh, how interesting.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.300
That's awesome.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:30.940
We made it.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.580
How about you?

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.700
Anything going on?

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.520
Nothing too major.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.120
I'm working on a couple of projects like always and have news on them eventually.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.720
But I do want to give a shout out to Pi Ladies.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.920
So we were just in Cleveland, Ohio, right?

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.720
Had a nice time at Pi Con there not long ago.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:44.960
Yeah.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.320
Yeah.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.760
So Cleveland now has an official Pi Ladies meetup or group.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.080
So they just launched and they're going to have their first meeting on June 22nd.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.260
And I linked to their meetup and their Twitter and everything in the show notes.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:01.520
So if you're interested in Pi Ladies and you're somewhat near Cleveland or you can even stream

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:01.920
it live.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.680
I think they're streaming their stuff live on YouTube.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.000
So you could check that all out just in the links to the show notes.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.400
Awesome.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.060
That's great.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.440
Cool.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:07.780
Yeah.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.880
One more good step down that path.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.260
That's awesome.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.260
All right.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.580
So thanks.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:16.340
And it was great to share the GitHub conversation with you.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.080
Yeah, it was.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.120
I thought we'd be more argumentative, but we're pretty much in agreement.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:20.640
Yeah.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.020
That's too bad.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.560
Would have been fun, but we don't argue too much, I don't think.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:25.900
All right.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.000
We'll talk to you next week.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:27.260
Yeah.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.020
Catch you next week.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:28.180
