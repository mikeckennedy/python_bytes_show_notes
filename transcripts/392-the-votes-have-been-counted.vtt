00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.300
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:12.700
to your earbuds. This is episode 392, recorded July 17th, 2024. I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.940
And I'm Brian Ackin.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.300
This episode is brought to you by Code Comments, an original podcast from Red Hat. So thank you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.400

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.480
that we might send out and other things, live events, who knows. So sign up, be in the know,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.320
and we'd love to talk to you there. And we won't share. Brian.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.300
And we were going to do a contest or something.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.000
Oh, yes, we're going to do a contest. The numbers are growing and we reach a monumental number.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.940
I'm pulling up my list of monk management here. We are close. We're getting quite close here.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.080
So, yeah, we're going to do some kind of contest. Yeah, some kind of giveaways. We'll see what that is.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.060
The 2024 PSF board election and bylaw election. The election happened and the results are in already.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.380
So it happened pretty quick. And nobody's demanded a recount yet. So, you know, that's good.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.620
I guess we don't do that in the PSF.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:44.660
But so new board members, Tanya Allard, Quan Hay Bay and Christian Moriera Frades, I think.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.320
But congratulations to the three new board members. Super awesome. Should be fun for you.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.360
One of the things in this announcement was that the where was it?

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.880
Basically, it says what's next. If there's four here, it is at the bottom.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.560
There's four seats open again next year. So it might feel early.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.020
But if you're kind of thinking about running for the board, it might not be early to think about it now to get ready and think about what you want to propose and stuff.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:23.960
So and they suggest reaching out to one or two current board members to ask them about their experience before throwing your hat in the ring.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.280
So it actually sounds pretty interesting. So anyway, so the three new board members, congrats.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.760
And then also all of the ESF bylaw changes passed heartily, like with a big margin.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.040
So let's take a look at that a little bit. So they oh, let's look at what they are again.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.600
So there were merging, contributing and managing member classes.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.800
That's it seems like a no brainer. I'm glad they're doing that.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.380
Simplifying the voter affirmation process by treating past voting activity as intent to continue voting.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.440
That makes sense. Yeah, I like that one.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.580
Because in order to vote, you have to attest that you're interested in voting for some reason now, which is funky.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.380
Would so. Well, well, also, I mean, it makes sense for like counting it.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.860
Like, you know, if if if we just send it to everybody and just what, give them three weeks to vote.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.660
I mean, it's how long do you have to wait?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.900
The I don't know. Make it's it's all right.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.180
Now, if you voted this year, you'll automatically be able to vote next year.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.880
That makes sense.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.720
And then the third one of allowing for removal of fellows by a board vote in response to code of conduct violations.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.600
That was there was a lot of controversy on the chat and stuff and in the mailing list.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.880
However, that third third one and all of them, the third one passed like by a huge margin.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.720
Second one, also huge margin.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.100
First, huge margin.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.660
So it's, you know, smaller margin for three, but basically still most people are for it.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.520
And I was for it, too.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.700
And I trust our board.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.420
So I think it's a good thing.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.160
So if you want to read more about all of these, there's a link to all the different bylaw changes.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.480
So you can read more about them if you want to.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.560
Yeah, cool. Very cool.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.520
Hey, I do have a quick comment here.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.660
OK, so these the number of people who voted are in the hundreds, like 300, 400,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.740
something like that.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.460
There are millions of Python developers, literally millions.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.940
There's plenty, tens of thousands of people who just listen to this podcast who are in in the know and interested enough.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.240
Vote, guys and girls.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.860
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.180
Be part of the community by voting.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.460
It's a good way to every voice heard.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.300
I also really enjoyed this year.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:47.140
Like and I do this every year of actually reading about the different reading all the different board candidates and what they've done.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.560
It's kind of a neat way just to like catch up on some people and what the what their contributions to Python are.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.660
So catch a little zeitgeist.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.580
Where's the whole community going in a sense?

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.220
But not as much as if you listen to Python bytes every week because then it's like the rapids of zeitgeist.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.420
You can barely stand it.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.220
Speaking of barely standing it.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.980
Imagine if you were on Saturn doing doing data science.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.900
Oh, OK.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.040
So we obviously know about Jupyter, which is our biggest planet, clearly.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.480
But Saturn is pretty big, too.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.020
And it's cool.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.740
It's got cooler rings than Jupyter.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.580
So better for data science?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.000
I don't know.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.100
OK, seriously, this is Saturn.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.320
And it's a modern Jupyter desktop application for macOS.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.880
Cool.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.400
Pretty cool.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.540
So it's like super minimal.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.420
It has a bit of a not a JupyterLab.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.440
That's too close to the real Jupyter.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.520
But just the Jupyter notebook style, like straightforward.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.820
It's supposed to be real minimalist.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.160
It's nice and clean.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.420
It has a command palette.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.120
So you can, you know, command K or command shift P, whatever the hot key is.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.660
I don't know yet.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.240
I haven't tried it.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.940
So you just download it and you get going.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.060
I think it might come bundled with Python and you don't have to set up virtual environments and stuff.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.740
But you can connect it to so-called kernels or basically virtual environments that you would like there.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.300
All right.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.680
Yeah.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.400
So very nice.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.820
You just download it and get started.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.040
It has a built-in LLM.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:19.940
So you can ask it LLM things like describe the plot above and then plot it using or describe the date above and use a plot using plot using lines and scatter.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.360
And boom, it'll go and do that sort of thing.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.940
Pretty cool.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.480
Yeah.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.560
It's a very minimalist.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.860
Like I said, if that's your vibe, then this is it.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.480
There's a command palette you can use.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.700
I don't know what the hot key is.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.740
Again, it comes with black built in.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.180
So you get automatic formatting.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.680
Just press F apparently and boom, your whole notebook is formatted, which is really nice.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.360
I feel like that's one of the things kind of missing from notebooks is like a real nice sort of management of code in general.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.160
Like the autocomplete is not that great.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.840
I know you can press some hotkeys to trigger autocomplete, but it just doesn't happen as you type like many editors.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.180
You can also do cool things like copy.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.140
Just go to a graph copy and just paste it straight into.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.500
It's got a little copy button for the data tables and for the graphs and things like that.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.060
Yeah.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.360
So all super neat.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.480
Check it out.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.580
And my final thought here is download the alpha.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.180
There's no link to GitHub.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.320
So presumably this is not an open source thing, although perhaps it is.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.640
I just haven't found it, but there's no link to GitHub and there's no business model expressed here.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.940
So will this be a paid product?

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.980
Is it just not yet out on GitHub?

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.100
You know what I mean?

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.020
Like, I don't know.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.820
So buyer beware and by buyer, I mean person who downloads for free.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.780
Yeah.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.760
But it looks really promising to me.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.220
I really like the vibe here.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.240
Oh, okay.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.780
Okay.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.180
Go up.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.600
Oh, this is the rough thing.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.260
Let's see.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.860
They do have a blog.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:51.200
You can check it out, but it has literally one entry that says integrating the rough language server,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.020
which is, you know, like an engineering cool.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.620
That's fun, but it doesn't tell you anything about it.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.220
Oh, okay.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.480
It doesn't add any information to what I was just talking about.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.060
You know what I mean?

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.380
Yeah.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.640
And it doesn't have the Saturn.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.580
It has a link to an editor, one repo, but it isn't the Saturn repo.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.020
Okay.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.780
We'll see.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.800
But, you know, look, if somebody makes something that you pay money for, there's a super nice

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.120
data science app and it's not out of control.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.520
I'm not saying that's a negative thing.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.800
I'm just saying it's not clear what its status is, you know?

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.220
Yeah.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:26.540
But also, if anybody that's part of this, like Jack Hodkinson or anybody else on Saturn team,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.960
let us know what's going on.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.700
Shoot us an email.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.300
Speaking of stuff we want to let people know about, I bet there's some code comments in

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.580
this Saturn code there.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:34.980
What do you think?

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.960
I think probably.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.520
Probably.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.040
This episode is brought to you by Code Comments, an original podcast from Red Hat.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.340
You know, when you're working on a project and you leave behind a small comment in the code,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.840
maybe you're hoping to help others learn what isn't clear at first.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.780
Sometimes that code comment tells a story of a challenging journey to the current state of the project.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:02.940
Code Comments, the podcast, features technologists who've been through tough tech transitions and they share how their teams survived that journey.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.220
The host, Jamie Parker, is a red hatter and an experienced engineer.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:15.240
In each episode, Jamie recounts the stories of technologists from across the industry who've been on a journey implementing new technologies.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.660
I recently listened to an episode about DevOps from the folks at Worldwide Technology.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:25.920
The hardest challenge turned out to be getting buy-in on the new tech stack rather than using that tech stack directly.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.400
It's a message that we can all relate to, and I'm sure you can take some hard-won lessons back to your own team.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.940
Give Code Comments a lesson.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:39.460
Search for Code Comments in your podcast player or just use our link, pythonbytes.fm/code dash comments.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.660
The link is in your podcast player's show notes.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.860
Thank you to Code Comments for supporting the show.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.680
Back over to you.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:52.700
I want to talk about something bad that happened on PyPI, but it could have been worse, but it's not.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.860
But it could have been.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.000
But it wasn't bad.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.340
Anyway, what happened was, and I'm going to link to a couple blog posts.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:06.420
One of them is on the PyPI.org blog from E Durbin.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.180
Incident report leaked GitHub personal access token.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:15.820
So what happened was, and E just go ahead and writes out the timeline of events.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.760
It was something that he was working on, something called Cabotage.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:37.500
And the gist of it is, he was trying to debug something and ran into some problems with timeouts for GitHub access tokens for the generic ones or the community ones or whatever.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.800
And so he used his own personal one for a while while he was developing it.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.820
Then he switched back.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:50.720
But his personal access token got saved into a PYC file that made it to a Docker image that got published.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:59.600
So this is bad because it would have given access to a whole bunch of PyPI and core stuff, including Python.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.260
Probably not good.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:17.040
So what happened, how this was found, though, was JFrog does a regular binary scan of a lot of packages that are open source projects that we rely on, including Python and stuff.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:25.260
And they found this problem, and they notified the security team on PyPI.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:32.200
And the token, the security team from PyPI revoked the token within 17 minutes of getting notified.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.020
This is like amazingly, blazingly fast, I think.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:46.980
And JFrog even points this out, that this is, we had a research team identified it, reported to PyPI, and it was revoked in a mere 17 minutes, which is super cool.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.280
Anyway, so it was revoked.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.040
It was fixed.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:58.920
And then afterwards, a scan was done to find out if that access token was used for anything, and it wasn't.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.400
So it wasn't exploited at all.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:12.240
But there are some good takeaways that, and in the original blog post, it does talk a little bit more about the details about how this showed up in the Docker file.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.420
But the takeaways are a few of them.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.600
There's three of them.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.620
First, set aggressive expiration dates for API tokens.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:29.660
So if you are going to use an API token, only have it for as long as you need it, and have it, you know, consider the timeout.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.880
Because if it escapes, you have to deal with that.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.120
Also, treat PYC files as if they were source code.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.980
So, and that's, you know, normally I don't think about that, because we don't publish PYC files.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.980
But if they're in a Docker image, it's going to get published, right?

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:56.880
So the other way was, the other note was only release builds from automated systems on, like, use a CI system with a clean source only.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:05.000
So some great reminders that PYC files are really something to be careful about also, and be very careful with access tokens.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.180
Yeah, pretty scary.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.340
Pretty scary.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.840
The TechRadar folks, TechRadar is speaking in the right place.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.800
I really like their writing.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:19.000
They phrased it as, a GitHub token leak could have put the entire Python language at risk.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.040
What if Python itself was malicious?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.680
Right?

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:29.600
Because, I mean, it gave anyone who wanted to get a hold of that right access to the Python, CPython repo and other parts of deployment.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.240
It's not ideal.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.840
Yeah.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.860
But it sounds like it was caught, so it's really good.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.980
Could have been very bad.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.780
Yes.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.980
Another bullet dodged.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.160
Another bullet dodged.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.220
But both posts are interesting reads.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:46.220
The JFrog one also has quite a bit of good information about, you know, how to protect from this.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:53.240
And some of the actions, some of the new GitHub access tokens have a way, they're easier to scan than they used to be able.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.180
They're easier to find because there's like a prefix that you can scan for within binaries.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:58.960
So that's pretty cool.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.840
Oh, right, right, right.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.160
Yeah, they've changed that format.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:01.760
That's good.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:01.940
Yeah.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.380
I would like to go on a bit of an extra, extra, extra.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.780
This was not the intention.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.060
I had some other topic and I'm like, and another extra, another extra.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.860
All right, this is, this is out of control.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.760
Let's, so you ready?

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.460
Extra, extra, extra here all about it.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.440
Yeah, I'm ready.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.280
All right, let's do it.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:23.940
Number one, first extra pretty quick here is Python 3.13 beta 3 has been released.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.260
This was a couple of days ago.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.500
It's not like, why would you put the data at the bottom?

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:28.960
I don't know.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.200
Anyway, I know it's at the top, June 27th.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.020
So it's actually been a little bit of time, but there's no other beta and people should be checking out.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.260
This is the third of four beta releases.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:46.740
So this is basically the last, last chance to make potential changes before it's completely just down to bug fixes, right?

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.220
Okay.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:47.700
Yeah.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:47.940
Okay.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:59.740
So the Python folks strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python packages to test with 3.13 during the beta phase and report any found issues to the Python bug tracker ASAP.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.720
It will be feature complete while the release is planned to be feature complete.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.860
Entering the beta phase is possible to get modified or changed based on how serious any problems might be.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.260
Anyway, 3.13 beta 3.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:11.760
Awesome.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.040
Mini bar ice.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.560
I told you guys about this when there was the bartender.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.180
I was such a fan of bartender.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.280
Recommend it everywhere.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.560
And then bartender went a little funky.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.260
It's not that it was sold to someone else.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:23.740
That's the problem.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.140
It's that it was sold.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.660
And the fact that it was sold was obscured.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.120
That's the problem, right?

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.180
Talked about that previously.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:37.920
So I switched to ice and ice was like, it kind of does the thing that bartender used to, but it's, it hides menu.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.000
Like it doesn't seem to show everything reliably.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.120
And anyway, it was really kind of janky, but this thing, I think got a ton of attention since all that happened.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.580
It's got a lot of contributions.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:52.940
So new release, a lot of bug fixes, primarily like a cool little dropdown that like shows all your stuff in a second.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.300
Like if you click on it, it'll show you a little second window.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:56.960
Really nice.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.480
So I can more strongly recommend open source free ice than before.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.400
Links in the show notes.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.920
You got a lot of stuff up there, man.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.100
That's why I need this thing.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.000
It's out of control, man.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.360
I'm telling you, it's a problem.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:08.840
All right.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.700
Last time you mentioned the article, I will pile drive you if you say AI again.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.940
And it resonated strongly with me.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.920
All right.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.680
Yeah.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:25.820
So the Primogen guy did a one hour Prime reacts to the I will pile drive you article and it is gold.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.960
So check out this if you just want to like sit back and listen to it in the background.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.280
This is a really good video.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.140
It's worth your hour of time.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.100
So check that out.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.200
I listened to an interview.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:42.040
I don't have the link right off the bat, but I listened to a podcast episode of somebody interviewing the guy also.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.620
Oh, okay.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.240
Interesting.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:43.820
Yeah.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.600
He does a good stream sort of thing.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:46.960
All right.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.740
Next up, we talked about Polyfill, I think a couple of episodes ago, right?

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.440
Polyfill.io and all that.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.880
So Polyfill was, polyfill.io used to be run by some financial publication.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.840
I can't remember exactly.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.360
I don't want to misattribute them.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.540
And then they were sold.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.960
They were like a CDN for JavaScript stuff.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.440
And they were sold to a Chinese company, which in itself is not necessarily bad.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.860
But then the Chinese company started sending malicious code instead of regular JSON polyfills to its users.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:23.620
But in a super select way, like, oh, are you doing an authentication at this third party identity as a service thing?

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.500
Well, maybe now you're getting the bad JavaScript or whatever, you know?

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.500
So really, really tricky stuff.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.420
And the polyfill.io domain was not unregistered.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.520
It was basically blocked by its register, which I think was Namecheap.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.760
But there are four other domains that it turns out that they're also using as CDNs.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.980
I don't know what happened to them.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.320
Maybe they've been dealt with by now, but maybe not.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.520
But also, what if polyfill.io just re-registers somewhere else eventually?

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.480
Is this possible?

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.240
I don't actually know.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.360
So I posted a thing on, posted on it on Twitter saying,

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.880
hey, if you have some kind of fancy DNS, you might want to put blocks in for all these domains.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:07.020
So staticfile.org, staticfile.net, bootcss.com, bootcdn.net, and polyfill.io.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:12.420
Those are all blocked in my next DNS, which is awesome, which is like a pie hole.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.080
But you get access to it anywhere, not just while you're at your house, which is better, I think.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.340
Cool.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.800
Yeah.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.040
So if you care about that stuff, this is one way to say you can now surf the web.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.840
And even if you go to a vulnerable website, it won't load these things.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.080
So that's always good.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.660
All right.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.120
Nice.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.320
Next up, we have the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey 2024.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.160
The survey is now open.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.980
It's pretty intense.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.040
Takes like 25 minutes.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:44.200
But if you want to complete it, contribute to sort of, you know, what editor is popular,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.480
what frameworks you're using, do you like databases, et cetera.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:54.640
For this, you may win a MacBook Pro 16, an NVIDIA GeForce, some phones, and so on, and so on.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.020
A bunch of stuff you can win, potentially.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.680
Code the Castle in October, October 5 to 12th in Tuscany.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.240
It still has some seats open.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.520
So check that out at talkpython.fm/castle.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.200
If you're interested, a week of half Python learning, half excursions in Tuscany.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.880
So check that out as well.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.140
And that concludes my extra, extra, extra Hear All About It.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.580
So do you need somebody to help, like, you know, carry your equipment?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.280
Yeah, sure.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.260
I mean, I'm going to bring a MacBook Air, so that is pretty heavy.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.140
Would you like to help?

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.140
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.600
If you want to pay for my trip, I would definitely help you out.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.020
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:29.260
Awesome.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:29.960
I appreciate that.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.020
No, it looks like fun.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.380
I'm excited to hear about that when you get back.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.100
Yeah, I am too.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.760
I'm thinking of doing a couple days of motorcycle riding.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.860
There's, like, some off-road enduro tours you can do there.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.660
Like, it's pretty close.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.420
If I can link those together, then I'll need help carrying, like, all the motorcycle gear

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.920
that will, like, out way out.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.500
Are you going to try to check your motorcycle as a...

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.560
No, you can rent motorcycles there.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:52.920
Okay.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.420
Yeah, check it.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.400
I'll just ship it ahead.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.760
It'll be there waiting for me.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.200
Yeah.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.740
Awesome.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.400
How about your extras?

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:58.740
Got anything?

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.080
Yeah.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.560
So I wanted to...

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:01.980
Let's see.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.520
I'm working on a new PyTOS course.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.800
So already on Talk Python training, there is the Getting Started with pytest course.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.720
It is three and a half hours long.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.580
So it's kind of the...

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.060
It's not...

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.800
It's pretty quick.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.100
Covers a lot of the basics of pytest.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:21.500
I also have the complete pytest course over on courses.pythontest.com.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.180
This little...

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.080
I mean, the 162 lessons might freak people out.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.440
But a lot of the lessons, it's basically the entire Python testing with pytest book.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.540
And a lot of the videos are chopped up into, like, three minutes, four minutes.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.960
As they should be.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.420
Yeah.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.180
So...

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.420
But I do notice that there's a gap.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.580
So I'm...

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:49.860
The new course I'm working on is a really introduction to pytest, introduction to testing concepts.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.140
And this is...

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.560
And I really want it to be something that somebody could really watch in half a day easy.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.380
Or even just a little bit.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.180
And I'm targeting...

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:04.200
I'm hoping to be under an hour to introduce a lot of these great concepts.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.200
And this would be intended for people...

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.080
For the entire team.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.220
Like, my idea would be everybody on the team, including the manager, would take this little mini course.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.020
And then you'd have a couple experts.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.180
A couple people that want to be the pytest experts take the complete course or something.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:24.360
Or the one on Talk Python training to be more in-depth.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.860
And so that...

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.340
I think there's a gap there for the little quick intro.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.360
So I'm working on that.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.560
That'll be fun.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.520
I agree with you, by the way.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.640
I do think there's probably a good gap there as well.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.080
Yeah.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.960
Also, and I'm kind of wanting that for my internal, for my own company.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.500
Of like, I don't think I can tell people to go watch an eight-hour video.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.640
I don't remember if it's eight hours or not.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.560
But it's...

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.400
Well, also...

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:47.640
Okay.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.340
I want to have people not freak out too much.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.780
It's split into three parts.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.080
And you really...

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.120
The intent of the entire book wasn't to read everything.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.520
It's to read the first part and then use the rest of it as resources as necessary.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.820
So same with the course.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.340
Okay.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.940
I've got other stuff going on too.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:04.820
I have a couple...

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.340
These other couple podcasts.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.340
Python people.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.780
I thought it was a great idea.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.380
But I just haven't had time.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.520
So it hasn't been updated since May.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.060
I'm just going to officially say it's kind of indefinitely on hold.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.720
I don't know what's going to happen with it.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.900
But I'm not working on it.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.140
Okay.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.540
And Python test.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.240
It was test and code.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.600
And it's still like the...

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.540
Still the little icon is still testing code.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.240
And now it's Python test for 14 episodes.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.040
14 out of 221.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.100
I am going to flip-flop and probably switch back to testing code.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.380
Because there's a series I want to do about test-driven development.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.320
And it's really...

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.960
It's not...

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.000
It's language agnostic.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.340
So it doesn't really make sense to have it be under the Python banner.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.280
And I probably...

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.080
I can't...

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.800
I want to say I promise to not switch it again.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.280
But, you know, who knows?

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.180
It's whatever.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.240
So that's...

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.560
Those are my extras.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.080
I'll probably get back to record.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.680
I'm still roughing out the ideas for the series.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.640
It'll probably come out in August or September.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.260
Excellent.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.740
Well, I look forward to it.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.220
Very cool.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.360
But that wasn't very funny, though.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.300
No, it was not.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:09.940
It was not.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.880
Good thing about podcasts, if people subscribe to them and a year later you're like,

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.900
all right, I'm ready for more Python people, it'll just start showing up in their players again.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.300
Yeah.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.500
And I'll talk, you know, follow Python bytes.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.840
We're not going to stop Python bytes anytime.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.820
Well, there's no plan on it.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.520
There's definitely no plan on it.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:25.880
All right.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.400
Let's get something a little bit funny.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.740
Now, I know there's been a lot of talk about AI, although I'm frightened of being pile-drived.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.060
I don't know if people know this wrestling term, but it's disturbing.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.160
Anyway, I'm a little worried about it.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.380
But this is not helping you code with AI.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.920
This is just straight-up editor help that I also consider super important.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.020
It's entitled, I Need My IntelliSense.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.500
Are you a fan of Scooby-Doo, Brian?

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.420
Yeah.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.460
Did you watch Scooby-Doo, the cartoon, growing up?

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.580
So here's, what's the woman's name with reddish hair?

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.420
Did I?

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.580
I still catch up.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.320
I still keep up on all the Scooby-Doo's.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.040
Awesome.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.580
So she has glasses and she lost them, obviously, like the picture.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.160
She's lost.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.020
I've lost my glasses in this like scary house or whatever.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.760
But the caption is, my IntelliSense.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.900
I can't code without my IntelliSense.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.140
Oh, I relate.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.140
That's pretty funny.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:16.600
Yeah.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.040
Yeah.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.660
Anyway, I thought that would resonate with some folks out there.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.480
Would I have to actually look up what the parameters are?

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.700
That's just barbaric.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.040
It's totally barbaric.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.740
And it's a segment of your mind that doesn't need to be filled with those details.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.320
You just type and let it flow.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:37.500
One of the things, though, that I, all the pop-ups that happen to help you out, like,

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.240
it's great.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.460
Except for, like, I wish there was a toggle that I could just turn everything off or on.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.540
Because when I'm developing, I like those on.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:50.520
But when I'm recording a course or something, I don't want all those popping up all the time.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.180
So do turn them off for your courses and stuff?

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.180
No, I have them on.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.260
I try to show people, like, look, here's your options.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.760
This is the one you pick out of the list.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.920
So, yeah, I leave them on.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.240
Yeah.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.920
Okay.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.100
I don't want to lose my glasses.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.040
All right.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.240
Well, I'll try that.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.420
Indeed.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.080
All right.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.120
I think there's also ways you can just set the aggressiveness of it, which I think sounds

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.040
like something you might want, like, in a serious way.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.080
So you can set it so if you just press a dot, boom, like, the list comes up.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.860
Or you can set it so there's some other key, like, control dot or something you've got to,

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.920
like, choose, which you wouldn't normally hit in the course of typing to trigger that kind

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.140
of stuff.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:29.980
So look into that.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.380
Yeah.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.240
I think there's a delay, too, you can say.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.440
Like, if I'm just going to start typing, don't pop that stuff up.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:36.740
Yeah.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:36.980
Yeah.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.440
Indeed.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.260
Yeah.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:38.680
Anyway.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.060
Cool.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:39.560
All right.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.060
Well, thanks for another fun show.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.420
Thanks, everyone, for listening.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.100
Thank you.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.640
Bye.
