00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.840
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.160
This episode is brought to you by Code Comments, an original podcast from Red Hat. So thank you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.360
Brian.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.120
And we were going to do a contest or something.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.080
Yes, we're going to do a contest. The numbers are growing and we reach a monumental number.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.480
I'm pulling up my list monk management here. Ooh, we are close. We're getting quite close here. So

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.080
yeah, we're going to do some kind of contest.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.800
Do some giveaways.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.800
Yeah. Some kind of giveaways. We'll see what that is.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.440
The 2024 PSF board election and bylaw election. The election happened and the results are in

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.120
already. So it happened pretty quick. And nobody's demanded a recount yet. So that's good.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.920
I guess we don't do that in the PSF. But so new board members, Tanya Allard,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.840
Quan Hei Bay, and Christian Moriera-Fredes, I think. But congrats to the three new board members.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.400
Super awesome. Should be fun for you. One of the things in this announcement was that the,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.800
where was it? Basically it says, what's next? If there's four, here it is at the bottom.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.880
There's four seats open again next year. So it might feel early, but if you're kind of thinking

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.920
about running for the board, it might not be early to think about it now to get ready and think about

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.280
what you want to propose and stuff. And they suggest reaching out to one or two current board

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.000
members to ask them about their experience before throwing your hat in the ring. So

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.320
it actually sounds pretty interesting. So anyway, so the three new board members, congrats.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:38.080
And then also all of the PSF bylaw changes passed heartily, like with a big margin. So let's take a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.360
look at that a little bit. So the, Oh, let's look at what they are again. So there were merging,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.160
contributing and managing member classes. That's, it seems like a no brainer. I'm glad they're

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.760
doing that. Simplifying the voter affirmation process by treating past voting activity as

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.800
intent to continue voting. That makes sense. Yeah, I like that one. Cause in order to vote,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.440
you have to attest that you're interested in voting for some reason now, which is funky.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.320
Would sell. Well, well also, I mean, it makes sense for like counting it. Like, you know, if,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.960
if, if we just send it to everybody and just what, give them three weeks to vote. I mean,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.400
it's, it's how long do you have to wait? The, I don't know, make it's, it's all right. Now,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.640
if you voted this year, you'll automatically be able to vote next year. That makes sense.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.240
And then the third one of allowing for removal of fellows by a board vote in response to code

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.640
of conduct violations. That was there was a lot of controversy on the chat and stuff and in the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.280
mailing list. However that third, third one and all of them, the third one passed like by a huge

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:51.440
margin. Second one, also huge margin, first huge margin. So it's, you know, smaller margin for

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.840
three, but basically still most people are for it. And I was for it too. And I, I trust our board.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.760
So I think it's a good thing. So if you want to read more about all of these there's a link to

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.240
all the different bylaw changes so you can read more about them if you want to.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.160
- Yeah, cool. Very cool. Hey, I do have a quick comment here. So these the, the number of people

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.560
who voted are in the hundreds, like 300, 400, something like that. There are millions of Python

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.680
developers, literally millions. There's plenty, tens of thousands of people who just listened to

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.120
this podcast who are in, in the know and interested enough. Vote guys and girls.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.360
- Yeah. Yeah. Be part of the community by voting. It's a, it's a good way to every voice heard.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.800
I also really enjoyed this year, like, and I do this every year of actually reading about the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.440
different, reading all the different board candidates and what they've done. It's kind

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.680
of a neat way just to like catch up on some people and what the, what their contributions

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.440
to Python are. So. - Catch a little zeitgeist. Where, where's the whole community going in a sense?

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.440
- Yeah. - But not as much as if you listen to Python Bytes every week, because then it's like

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.800
the rapids of zeitgeist. You can barely stand it. Speaking of barely standing it, imagine if you

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:14.720
were on Saturn doing, doing data science. - Well. - Okay. So we obviously know about Jupyter, which

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.440
is our biggest planet, clearly, but Saturn is pretty big too. And it's cool. It's got cooler

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.760
rings than Jupyter. So better for data science. I don't know. Okay. Seriously, this is Saturn and

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:33.040
it's a modern Jupyter desktop application for macOS. - Cool. - Pretty cool. So it's like super

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.800
minimal. It has a bit of a, not a JupyterLab. That's too close to the real Jupyter, but just

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.520
the Jupyter notebook style, like straightforward. It's supposed to be real minimalist, right? It's

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.560
a nice and clean. It has a command palette. So you can, you know, command K or command shift P,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.160
whatever the hot key is. I don't know yet. I haven't tried it. So you just download it and

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.160
you get going. I think it might come bundled with Python and you don't have to set up virtual

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.880
environments and stuff, but you can connect it to so-called kernels or basically virtual

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.960
environments that you would like there. All right. So very nice. You just download it and get started.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.520
It has a built-in LLM. So you can ask it LLM things like describe the plot above and then plot

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.560
it using or describe the data above and use a plot using a plot using lines and scatter and boom,

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.040
it'll go and do that sort of thing. Pretty cool. It's very minimalist. If like I said,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.960
if that's your vibe and then this is it, there's a command palette you can use. I don't know what

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.240
the hockey is. It again comes with black built-in. So you get automatic formatting, just press F

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.320
apparently and boom, your whole notebook is formatted, which is really nice. I feel like

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.200
that's one of the things kind of missing from notebooks is like a real nice sort of management

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.520
of code in general. Like the auto-complete is not that great. I know you can hit, there's like,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.760
you can press some hotkeys to trigger auto-complete, but it just doesn't happen as you type.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.640
Like many editors, you can also do cool things like copy, just go to a graph, copy, and just

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.560
paste it straight into a, it's got a little copy button for the data tables and for the graphs and

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.080
things like that. Yeah. So all super neat. Check it out. And my final thought here is download the

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.800
alpha. There's no link to github. So presumably this is not an open source thing, although perhaps

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.680
it is. I just haven't found it, but there's no link to get up and there's no business model

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.640
expressed here. So will this be a paid product? Is it just not yet out on GitHub? You know what I

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.640
mean? Like, I don't know. So buyer beware. And by buyer, I mean, person who downloads for free.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.320
Yeah. But it looks really promising to me. I really like the vibe here.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.920
Oh, okay. Okay. Go up. Oh, this is the rough thing. Let's see.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:49.520
We do have a blog. You can check it out, but it has literally one entry that says integrating the

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.400
rough language server, which is, you know, like an engineering cool. That's fun, but it doesn't

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.200
tell you anything about it. It doesn't add any information to what I was just talking about.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.920
You know what I mean? Yeah. And it doesn't have the Saturn as a link to the, an editor,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.440
one repo, but it isn't the Saturn repo. We'll see. But you know, I look, if somebody makes

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.160
something that you pay money for, there's a super nice data science app and it's not out of control.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.760
I'm not saying that's a negative thing. I'm just saying it's not clear what its status is, you know?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.640
Yeah. But also if one of the, if anybody that's part of this, like, Jack Hodkinson or

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.920
anybody else on Saturn team, let us know. Yeah. Shoot us an email. Speaking of stuff,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.320
we want to let people know about, I bet there's some code comments in this Saturn code there.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.040
What do you think? I think probably. Probably. This episode is brought to you by Code Comments,

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.440
an original podcast from Red Hat. You know, when you're working on a project and you leave behind

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.960
a small comment in the code, maybe you're hoping to help others learn what isn't clear at first.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.160
Sometimes that code comment tells a story of a challenging journey to the current state of the

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.360
project. Code Comments, the podcast features technologists who've been through tough tech

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.160
transitions, and they share how their teams survived that journey. The host, Jamie Parker,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.760
is a Red Hatter and an experienced engineer. In each episode, Jamie recounts the stories of

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.280
technologists from across the industry who've been on a journey implementing new technologies.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.840
I recently listened to an episode about DevOps from the folks at Worldwide Technology. The

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:25.040
hardest challenge turned out to be getting buy-in on the new tech stack rather than using that tech

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.520
stack directly. It's a message that we can all relate to, and I'm sure you can take some hard

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.080
won lessons back to your own team. Give Code Comments a listen. Search for Code Comments in

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:51.840
to you. I want to talk about something bad that happened on PyPI, but it could have been worse,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.160
but it's not, but it could have been, but it wasn't bad. Anyway, what happened was,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:06.240
and I'm going to link to a couple blog posts. One of them is on the PyPI.org blog from E. Durbin.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:13.920
Incident report leaked GitHub personal access token. What happened was, and E. just go ahead

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.080
and writes out the timeline of events. It was something that he was working on, something

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:29.840
called Cabotage. The gist of it is, he was trying to debug something and ran into some problems with

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:39.840
timeouts for GitHub access tokens for the generic ones or the community ones or whatever. He used

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.760
his own personal one for a while while he was developing it, then he switched back,

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.920
but his personal access token got saved into a PYC file that made it to a Docker image that

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:58.000
got published. This is bad because it would have given access to a whole bunch of PyPI and core

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.320
stuff, including Python. Probably not good. What happened, how this was found though, was JFrog

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:15.600
does a regular binary scan of a lot of packages or open source projects that we rely on,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:25.200
including Python and stuff. They found this problem and they notified the security team on PyPI.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:32.720
The security team from PyPI revoked the token within 17 minutes of getting notified. This is

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:38.480
like amazingly, blazingly fast, I think. JFrog even points this out, that this is,

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:45.760
research team identified it, reported to PyPI and it was revoked in a mere 17 minutes,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:53.760
which is super cool. Anyway, it was revoked, it was fixed. Then afterwards, a scan was done to

00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:00.400
find out if that access token was used for anything and it wasn't. It wasn't exploited at all.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:07.520
But there are some good takeaways that, and there's in the original blog post, it does talk

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.120
about a little bit more about the details about how this showed up in the Docker file. But the

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:21.040
takeaways are a few of them. There's three of them. First, set aggressive expiration dates for API

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.680
tokens. If you are going to use an API token, only have it for as long as you need it and have it,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:34.960
consider the timeout because if it escapes, you have to deal with that. Also treat PYC files as

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:41.840
if they were source code. Normally I don't think about that because we don't publish PYC files,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:50.240
but if they're in a Docker image, it's going to get published. The other note was only release

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:58.000
builds from automated systems on like use a CI system with a clean source only. So some great

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.920
reminders that PYC files are really something to be careful about also and be very careful

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:12.240
with access tokens. Yeah, pretty scary. Pretty scary. The TechRadar folks, TechRadar is in the

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.640
right place. I really like their writing. They phrase it as a GitHub token leak could have put

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.000
the entire Python language at risk. What if Python itself was malicious? Right? Because I mean, it

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.960
gave anyone who wanted to get a hold of that right access to the CPython repo and other parts of

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.960
deployment. It's not ideal. Yeah. But it sounds like it was caught. So it's really good. Could

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:39.280
have been very bad. So yes, another bullet dodged. Another bullet dodged. But both posts are

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:45.760
interesting reads. The JFrog one also has quite a bit of good information about how to protect from

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:51.360
this and some of the some of the actions, some of the new GitHub access tokens have a way they're

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.240
easier to scan than they used to be able. They're easier to find because there's like a prefix that

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.160
you can scan for within binary. So that's pretty cool. Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, they've

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.520
changed that format. That's good. Yeah. I would like to go on a bit of an extra, extra, extra.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.840
This was not the intention. I had some other topic and I'm like, and another extra, another extra.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.440
I'm like, all right, this is this is out of control. So you ready? Extra, extra, extra.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:20.000
Hear all about it. Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do it. Number one, first extra pretty quick. Here's

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.520
Python 313 beta three has been released. This was a couple of days ago. It's not like, why would you

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.720
put the data at the bottom? I don't know. Anyway, I know it's at the top, June 27th. So it's actually

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.120
been a little bit of time, but there's no other beta and people should be checking out. This is

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:43.040
the third of four beta releases. So this is basically the last chance to make potential

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:49.520
changes before it's completely just down to bug fixes. Right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So the Python

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:55.120
folks strongly encourage maintainers of third party Python packages to test with 313 during

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.640
the beta phase and report any found issues to the Python bug tracker ASAP. It will be feature

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.640
complete while the release is planned to be feature complete entering the beta phase as

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:10.880
possible to get modified or changed based on how serious any problems might be. Anyway, 313 beta

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:16.720
three. Awesome. Mini bar ice. I told you guys about this when there was the bartender. I was

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:22.160
such a fan of bartender recommend everywhere. And then bartender went a little funky. It's not that

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.720
it was sold to someone else. That's the problem is that it was sold. And the fact that it was sold

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.040
was obscured. That's the problem. Right. Talked about that previously. So I switched to ice and

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:37.840
ice was like, it kind of does the thing that bartender used to, but it's yeah. Hides menu.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.720
Like it doesn't seem to show everything reliably. And anyway, it was really kind of janky, but this

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.800
thing, I think got a ton of attention since all that happened. It's got a lot of contributions.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.840
So new release, a lot of bug fixes, primarily like a cool little dropdown that like shows all

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.480
your stuff in a second. Like if you click on it, it'll show you a little second window. Really

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:02.320
nice. So I can more strongly recommend open source free ice and before links in the show notes,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.760
you got a lot of stuff up there, man. That's why I need this thing. It's out of control, man.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:11.120
I'm telling you it's a problem. All right. Last time you mentioned the article, I will pile drive

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:19.600
you if you say AI again, and it resonated strongly with me. All right. Yeah. So, the primogen guy

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.720
did a one hour primary acts to the, I will pile drive you article and it is gold. So check out

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.680
this. If you just want to like sit back and listen to it, the background, this is a really good

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.720
video. it's worth your hour of time. So check that out. I listened to an interview. I don't

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.280
have the link right off the bat, but I listened to a podcast episode, somebody interviewing the

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:47.600
guy also. Okay. Interesting. Yeah. He does a good stream sort of thing. All right. Next up,

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:53.280
we talked about polyfill, I think a couple of episodes ago, right? Polyfill IO and all that.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:17:00.320
So polyfill was a polyfill.io used to be run by some financial publication. I can't remember

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.960
exactly. I don't want to misattribute them. And then they were sold. They were like a CDN for

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.520
JavaScript stuff. And they were sold to a Chinese company, which in itself is not necessarily bad,

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:15.040
but then the Chinese company started sending malicious code instead of regular Jason polyfills

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.560
to its users. But in a super select way, like, Oh, are you doing a, an authentication at this

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.680
third party identity as a service thing? Well, maybe now you're getting the bad

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:32.080
JavaScript or whatever, you know? So really, really tricky stuff. And the polyfill.io domain

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:38.400
was on not unregistered. It was basically blocked by its registrar, which I think was name cheap,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.040
but there are four other domains that it turns out that they're also using as CDNs. I don't know

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.200
what happened to them. Maybe they've been dealt with by now, but maybe not. But also what if

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.840
polyfill.io just re-register somewhere else eventually? Is this possible? I don't actually

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:58.000
know. So I posted a thing on, posted on it on Twitter saying, Hey, if you have some kind of

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.400
fancy DNS, you might want to put blocks in for all these domains. So static file.org, static

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:09.920
file.net, bootcss.com, bootcdn.net and polyfill.io. Those are all blocked in my next DNS, which is

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.280
awesome, which is like a pie hole, but you get access to it anywhere, not just while you're at

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.880
your house, which is better, I think. Cool. Yeah. So if you care about that stuff, this is one way

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.320
to say you can now surf the web. And even if you go to a vulnerable website, it won't load these

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:33.120
things. So that's always good. All right. Nice. Next up, we have the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:39.520
Survey 2024. The survey is now open. It's pretty intense. Takes like 25 minutes, but you can,

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.160
if you want to complete it, contribute to sort of, you know, what editor is popular,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.880
what frameworks are you using? Do you like databases, et cetera. For this, you may win

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:55.360
a MacBook Pro 16, an NVIDIA GeForce, some phones and so on and so on. A bunch of stuff. You can win

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:02.160
potentially. Coding the Castle in October, October 5 to 12th in Tuscany, still has some seats open.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:08.480
So check that out at hawkpython.fm/castle. And if you're interested, a week of half Python

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:14.640
learning, half excursions in Tuscany. So check that out as well. And that concludes my extra,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.040
extra, extra here all about it. So do you need somebody to help like, you know, carry your

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.320
equipment? Yeah, sure. I mean, I'm going to bring a MacBook Air, so that is pretty heavy. Would you

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.720
like to help? Yeah. Yeah. If you want to pay for my trip, I would definitely help you out. Yeah.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:35.280
Awesome. I appreciate that. No, it looks like fun. I'm excited to hear about that when you get back.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.120
Yeah, I am too. I figured of doing a couple of days of motorcycle riding, there's like some

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.840
off-road enduro tours you can do there. Like it's pretty close. If I can link those together,

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.640
then I'll need help carrying like all the motorcycle gear that will like,

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.480
Are you going to try to check your motorcycle as a, as a,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.440
No, you can rent motorcycles there. Yeah. Check it. I'll just ship it ahead. It'll,

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.560
it'll be there waiting for me. Yeah. Awesome. How about your extras? Got anything?

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:06.000
Yeah. So I wanted to let's see. I I'm working on a new pytest course. So already on talk,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.960
Python training, there is the getting started with pytest course. It is three and a half hours long.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:17.040
So it's kind of the, it's not, it's pretty quick. Covers a lot of the basics of pytest. I also have

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:24.320
the complete pytest course over on courses.pythontest.com. This little, I mean, the 162

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:30.160
lessons might freak people out, but a lot of the lessons it's it's basically the entire Python

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.560
testing with pytest book. And a lot of the videos are chopped up into like three, you know, three

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:40.480
minutes, four minutes. So as they should be. Yeah. So, but I do notice that there's, there's a,

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:47.680
there's a gap. So I'm I'm the new course I'm working on is a really introduction to pytest

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.520
introduction to testing concepts. And this is, and I really want it to be something that somebody

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:59.440
could really watch in half a day, easy, or even just a little bit. And I'm targeting, I'm hoping

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:06.080
to be under an hour to introduce a lot of these great concepts. And, and this would be intended

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.600
for people for the entire team. Like my idea would be everybody on the team, including the manager,

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:16.000
would take this little mini course. And then you'd have a couple of experts, a couple of people that

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.880
want to be the pytest experts, take the complete course or something, or, or the one on talk,

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:27.920
Python training to be more, more in depth. And, and so that I think there's a gap there for the

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.000
little quick intro. So I'm working on that. Awesome. That'll be fun. I agree with you,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.720
by the way, that do you think there's probably a good gap there as well?

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.280
Yeah. Also, and I'm, I'm kind of wanting that for my internal, for my own company of like,

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:44.560
I don't, I don't think I can tell people to go watch an eight hour video. I don't remember if

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:50.240
it's eight hours or not, but it's well also, okay. I want to have people not freak out too much.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.600
It's split into three parts and you really, the intent of the entire book wasn't to read

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.880
everything it's to read the first part and then use the rest of it as resources as necessary. So

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.120
same with the course. Okay. I've got other stuff going on too. I've got a couple of these other

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.160
couple of podcasts, Python people. I thought it was a great idea, but I just haven't had time.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.360
So it hasn't been updated since May. I'm just going to officially say it's kind of indefinitely

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.080
on hold. I don't know what's going to happen with it, but I'm not working on it. Okay. And

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:26.080
Python test, it was testing code and it's still like this, still the little icon is still testing

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:33.280
code and now it's Python test for 14 episodes, 14 out of 221. I am going to flip flop and probably

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:39.280
switch back to testing code because there's a series I want to do about test driven development.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.360
And it's really pipe. It's not, it's language agnostic. So it doesn't really make sense to

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:50.160
have it be under the Python banner. And I probably, I can't, I want to say, I promised to not switch

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:56.400
it again, but you know, who knows? It's, it's whatever. So yeah, that's, those are my extras.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.760
I'll probably get back to record. I'm still roughing out the ideas for the series. It'll

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.000
probably come out in August or September. So excellent. Well, I look forward to it. Very cool.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.440
But that wasn't very funny though. No, it was not. It was not. Good thing about podcasts. If people

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.120
subscribe to them and in a year later, you're like, all right, I'm ready for more Python people.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.640
It'll just start showing up in their players again. Yeah. And I'll talk, you know, follow

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:24.080
Python bites. We're, we're not going to stop Python bites anytime. well, there's no plan on it. So

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.240
there's definitely no plan on it. All right. Let's, let's get something a little bit funny.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.640
Now. I know there's been a lot of talk about AI, although I'm frightened of being piled or I've,

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.600
I don't know if people know this wrestling term, but it's disturbing. Anyway, I'm a little worried

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.840
about it, but this is not, this is not helping you code with AI. This is just straight up editor

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.480
help that I also consider super important. It's entitled. I need my IntelliSense. Are you a fan

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.360
of Scooby-Doo Brian? yeah. Did you watch Scooby-Doo the cartoon growing up? So here's,

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.560
what's the woman's name with reddish hair? Did I, I still catch up. I still keep up on all the

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:04.080
Scooby-Doo's. Awesome. So she has glasses and she lost them, obviously like the picture. She's lost.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:10.000
I've lost my glasses in this like scary house or whatever, but the caption is my IntelliSense. I

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.680
can't code without my IntelliSense. Oh, I, I really, that's pretty funny. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.440
I thought that would resonate with some folks out there. What I have to actually look up what the

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:27.440
parameters are. That's just barbaric. It's totally barbaric. And it's a segment of your mind that

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.080
doesn't need to be filled with those details. You just type and let it flow. One of the things

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:38.400
though that I, the, all the pop-ups that happen to help you out. Like it's great, except

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.440
for if you like, I'm in, I wish there was a toggle that I could just turn everything off or on

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.760
because when I'm developing, I like those on, but when I'm recording a course or something,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.200
I don't want all those popping up all the time. So do you turn them off for your courses and stuff?

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.520
No, I have them on. I try, I try to show people like, look, here's your options. This is the one

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.960
you pick out of the list though. Yeah. I leave them on. Yeah. I don't want to lose my glasses.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:10.640
All right. Well, I'll try that. So indeed. All right. I think there's also ways you can just

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.320
set the aggressiveness of it, which I think it sounds like something you might want, like in

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.280
a serious way. So you can set it. So if you just press a dot boom, like the list comes up or you

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:25.120
can set it. So there's some other key like control dot or something you've got to like choose,

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.360
which you wouldn't normally hit in the course of typing to trigger that kind of stuff. So look

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.080
into that. Yeah. I think there's a delay too. You can say like, if I'm, if I'm just going to

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:39.840
start typing, don't pop that stuff up. Yeah. Yeah, indeed. Anyway. Cool. All right. Well,

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.000
thanks for another fun show. Thanks everyone for listening. Thank you. Bye.
