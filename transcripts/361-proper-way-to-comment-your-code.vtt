00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.720
Not required, certainly.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.080
Not intended to be required, but fun to have them there.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.400
Yeah.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.640
What do you got for us first?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.520
Oh, well, very excited to be back together on the eve of Turkey Day.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.840
The Turkey Eve.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.560
So happy Turkey Eve by the eve of Turkey Eve.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.980
Eve, Eve.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.720
It's the eve squared.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.060
Yeah.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.960
I don't know how this multiplies together.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.760
Let's start talking about something snarky, aka Brett Cannon.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.320
So Brett Cannon did a nice write-up here about different keyboards.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.760
And Brian, I know you're a fan of ergonomic keyboards.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:24.180
I am definitely a fan of the ergonomic keyboards, having had serious RSI issues at one point in my career.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.460
And basically, if I type on a laptop keyboard for a week, I'd have to quit.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.560
I mean, quit my job.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.180
I'd be done.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.580
It's like that bad, right?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.020
I'm not making it up.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.680
Like, the carpal tunnel stuff is real.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.000
But with the right keyboard, I can literally type 10 hours a day, no problem at all.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.660
So choosing a keyboard is something I wish I'd paid more attention to when I was younger, but is super, super important.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.380
And Brett had his nice write-up on it.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.440
So that's what I'm going to cover today.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.720
Cool.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020
So basically, he says, look, here's what I care about.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.080
I have a bunch of different concerns, right?

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.920
So, you know, for him, it was more his back that was causing him problems.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.520
But he was looking to get a fully split keyboard.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.720
He went from something kind of like my keyboard, which I'll give a shout-out to in a second,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.600
to a completely split, which means the keyboard, the left, the part your left hand touches

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.980
and the part your right hand touches are not attached, at least not physically,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.040
maybe through a wire just so they communicate.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.940
So, well, okay, how do we go?

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.880
It talks about all the considerations, all the things that he cares about,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.000
and then goes through like a nice long list of things, right?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.420
Yeah.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.660
What has he used before?

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.740
The requirements are fully, must be fully split because he's using ergonomic one that's not fully split now.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.600
And like, this is his goal.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.440
It must tent, as in it must, like from the two edges, the middle must raise up and down.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.880
So like, like if you rotate your hands, I don't know, like this.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.420
Yeah.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.780
Without moving your arms at all, you just like left or right, like a clock, that kind of rotation.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.020
Want some portability.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.820
Interestingly, aesthetically pleasing to his wife because it has to be visible and somewhat programmable.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.140
Okay.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.260
So I don't want to go through his whole article.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.760
I just want to kind of give a shout out to a bunch of different keyboards and you'll get your thoughts as well.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.200
Okay.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.740
Okay.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:21.020
First of all, he says, Hey, look, I'm using, I think he was using, or at least was considering and like put it into the category of the Microsoft Surface ergonomic keyboard.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.940
That's a fine looking little keyboard right there.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.380
Yeah.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.800
It's like a full size keyboard or a hundred percent keyboard where it has the numbers and all of that.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.960
The numpad thing in addition to the numbers on the top, of course, it's fixed tinted, I guess you would call it, right?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.820
It's got a really good curve to it, but the curve you can't adjust.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.800
You can like lean it.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.940
So the starting point where like your arms start to touch is higher than the other one if you want and so on.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.280
But I actually got this when it first came out, maybe something's changed.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.340
But when this first came out, I'm like, oh, this looks great.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.780
I'm going to give this a try as an alternative to the one that I use.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.920
And you know what?

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.600
Unbelievably, even though it's Bluetooth, it doesn't work on macOS at all.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.780
So if you want to use this and you're using Windows, it looks pretty cool.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.880
If you're not using Windows, it's kind of more like paperweight than it is a keyboard.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.000
Maybe something about this has changed.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.460
But I mean, I took it when Microsoft had Microsoft stores like Apple stores.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.060
I took it back and I said, guys, I bought this.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.180
I can't seem to make it work on my MacBook.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.020
Can you?

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.880
And they're like, oh, yeah, sure.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.580
Of course it does.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.180
I'm like, all right.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.420
Let's here we go.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.860
Let's see.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.700
No, no, they couldn't get it to work either.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.360
See, I thought I've tried one.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.060
I thought I tried one on a Mac a couple of years ago.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.880
Possible.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.000
Possible.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.800
I use the Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic, which is not the Microsoft Sculpt Surface ergonomic.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.140
Oh, this is the one I tried.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.520
And that works everywhere.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.780
Yes, that works everywhere.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.700
That works everywhere.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.020
And it's smaller and it's lighter.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.800
And I think it's actually better across the board having had both.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.820
This one is fine.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.620
The Surface one.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.900
No, no, no.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.820
This one doesn't work.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.420
Okay.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.480
So another one, he said, like, some people really like the Apple Magic Keyboard, which

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.220
is like more art, less functionality.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.100
You know, it's very standard for Apple hardware, you know, save them, put the Macs and iPhone

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.620
stuff aside.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.660
But like the accessories, it's like, can we just make it beautiful?

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.380
I don't care if it's the most uncomfortable thing you've ever touched, like the Magic Mouse

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.840
or anything.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.800
This is like, I want Carpal Tunnel next week.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.860
I don't have it now.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.620
How can I get it?

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.460
Let's try this.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.460
So I don't necessarily recommend that.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.480
And then it starts going through like the real ergonomic ones that people might consider,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.460
starting with the Advantage 2 keyboard from Kinesis.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.260
And this is one of the weirder, more different ones.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.460
This is what I got.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.080
This is what I've been using for decades.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.780
Okay.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.720
Describe this for people.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.340
It's just.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.380
It's because it's unusual.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.720
Well, it seems unusual.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.280
Not in a bad way.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.000
But it's a split keyboard where you've got like basically divots where your fingers

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.020
go because your fingers are like, you know, they're not flat like a keyboard.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.160
They're curved around.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.660
So this.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.420
It's like if somebody dug a hole for the keys.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.700
Yeah.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.120
It matches the way your fingers move.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.740
And then because when programming, we do things like hit escape and all sorts of other stuff

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.940
and enter and backspace and home and all that stuff all the time.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.260
Those, instead of having your pinkies do that work, they put those keys in the middle.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.800
So your thumbs can do it.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.400
Yeah.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.020
And I really love that.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.020
And one of the first things I do is because I'm a VI user or Vim user is I map one of those

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.600
middle ones to escape because yeah, I want to address it.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.800
It's programmable too.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.660
So it's nice.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.220
Yeah.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.220
That's one of the big, as you started to explore it, it's one of the big areas is like,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.400
what does your thumbs do versus, you know, not just space bar, but your thumbs become

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.320
way more active.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.580
Yeah.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.560
And by programmable, I don't mean that you have to like write a program for it.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.460
I mean, it's you could just, there's like a key sequence.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.020
You can say, I want to remap this key to this other place.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.220
And it's, it's pretty easy.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.600
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.240
All right.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.120
So that was one that was on the list of considerations.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.480
We'll see how many more of these you've, you've experienced.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.720
So we have the moon lander Mark one.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.800
I've wanted to try that.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.600
It looks great.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.560
It's, it's nice and lit up.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.600
It's, it's quite cool.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.880
It's looks like it almost has like a track, those little nipple things that come on the

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.160
think pads.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.260
Like where there's like a, it's not a ball, but it's like a stick.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.380
That's like a, like a joystick for the mouse almost.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.740
Yeah.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.180
Yeah.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.300
This one looks pretty interesting.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.160
It's lit up.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.480
You can, I think program it, but this one's quite cool.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.020
It's fully split and it's got these little bars for the tenting.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:33.040
So you, you can adjust like how, you know, side to side it's like bent, which is pretty

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.260
neat.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.520
I think, what do you think about this one?

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.600
I'd, I'd like to use that, but one of the interesting bits is the middle keys are,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.580
they're just blank.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.600
Cause you can map whatever you want to them, but I, and a bunch of other blank ones.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.340
I'd rather have some replacement ones to, because I'm really not going to remember how I mapped

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:49.780
them.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.100
just got to Sharpie them.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.180
Sharpie thing.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.060
I guess.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.340
Yeah.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.120
And no kidding.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.780
No kidding.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.820
yeah.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.720
But yeah.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.980
The other thing that I really, that, I think about a lot is like these keys look

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.680
like they have a long up and down, like key throw, like the travel of the key seems high

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.080
and the travel of the keys on the sculpt ergonomic one is incredibly small, like probably

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.260
less than on a Mac book.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.220
And so like you could just barely move your fingers and you're typing.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.520
And some of these, it's like the mechanical style of like, you know, lots of hand movement,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.440
I'm not a fan of it, but that's.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440
I like mechanical.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.440
Yeah.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.180
But in theory I do.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.560
All right.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.880
Another one is the Kinesis gaming.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.060
Since you're a fan of Kinesis, have you looked at this thing?

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.560
No, it's flat.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.000
You can, no, you can tilt it.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
No, but it doesn't have the divots.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Oh, I see.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I see.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.500
I see.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.000
Gotcha.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.500
I know what you mean.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.340
It has no holes dug for the keys.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:43.840
Yeah.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.340
Yeah.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.340
This is pretty interesting.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.720
You can like tint it a lot, but it is kind of just like a, if you want the least weird keyboard,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.720
but you want to separate it.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.720
Right.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.100
So you can get like the right orientation of your wrists and stuff without causing trouble.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.100
This is pretty good.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.900
We've got the Digma Rays, which is also.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.100
I've heard of this one.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.840
Quite interesting one.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.020
Yeah.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.880
It's, it's similar to the gaming one.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.160
I think it's a little bit neater.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.920
It looks like it has like pretty far key throw, but it clicks together and then it clicks

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.920
apart.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.920
So that's kind of something you might, people might care about.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.920
Nice magnets to mess up your phone when you, that you sat next to it.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.920
Exactly.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.280
There's the Ergo Docks easy, which is another one.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.040
Lots of adjustability on like how it's oriented and things, which is kind of cool.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.400
Very thumb friendly, but no, no markings, right?

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.460
For the programmability.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.660
So you're going to have to need a white Sharpie for this one.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.660
Yeah.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.660
Yeah.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.660
Yeah.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.980
Hacking keyboard was a Barry Warsaw recommended this one, which it comes with a built in track

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.900
ball looking thing in the middle for one of your thumbs.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.900
Nice.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.900
Yeah.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.900
Okay.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.900
And notice also it has the Cordy.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.900
See as Hop, it says Cordy like for a display.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.900
So you can switch it into different modes like Dvorak.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.900
Okay.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.900
Like Liz out in the audience says, I'm a fan of Dvorak.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.900
Yeah.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.900
Pretty cool.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.900
Yeah.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.900
And then we have the Advantage 360 keyboard.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.900
That's on my want list.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.900
Wow.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.900
How's this different than the one that you saw you have already?

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.160
Well, it's, it's split.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.400
So it's, it's, it's completely split.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.220
Oh, like it's a fully, fully split one.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.800
And it, yeah.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.400
The Advantage 2 is actually connected together, but this one's split and it spread apart.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.400
Got it.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.400
Content.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.640
Definitely looks like a content.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.640
And the one that he actually went more, I believe went for is the Digma Defy.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.640
So you can defy your limits with this one, which looks pretty genius.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.640
Well, it's kind of so intimate.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.640
So intimate.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.540
You can hardly see a picture of it, but links up for all these in the show notes.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.760
But this one, like this one is thumb heavy.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.180
Brian, look at how many options your thumb gets to play with there.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.140
Oh, I like it.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.580
Yeah.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.080
Yeah.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.480
Yeah.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:41.880
Yeah.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.840
So apparently this one takes a little while to get, but anyway, I wanted to go through

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.700
this because I know there's a lot of people out there who might.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.460
Even if he decided on this one, this is the one he decided on now.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.160
Next month, you'll order another one.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:54.620
I'm sure.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.060
I know.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.320
I know exactly, exactly how it feels.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.260
But no, I think honestly, someone who's like had hand issues, don't skip on keyboards.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.300
Don't just think, well, it's weird.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.980
So I'm not going to try it.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.020
Like honestly, it's worth not doing something that's just square.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:12.900
That is your laptop.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.540
Yeah.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.780
Also stand up and walk around to shake yourself out once in a while.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.100
Exactly.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.700
10 hours sitting.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.280
We'll get a chair that just every so often, like the chair just springs you over in the

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.200
back and flings you out.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.620
And so it encourages you to get up before that happens.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.580
It's actually one of the things I like about the Apple Watch.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.660
It says like, hey, you should stand up.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.600
I know.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.420
It's usually great, except for when you're like in an airplane.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.400
It's like, you should get up and walk around like, you know what?

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.080
I'm in the middle seat.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.640
I don't think I'm going to right now.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:37.840
Yeah.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.280
Thanks, Apple Watch.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.180
Make me feel even more stuck where I am.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.060
All right.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.140
Well, that's it for my first item.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:43.680
What you got?

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.040
Okay.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.400
Well, I want to talk about a command line interface tool.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.480
So I just, a couple of things.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.360
I just wrote a blog post about testing command line interfaces, particularly arg parse.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.200
I should put a link in that and the extras.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:06.160
But also, I was covering that when I was recording the pytest course, talking about testing command line interfaces.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.360
So I tried a few.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.800
I went back and tried click.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.600
I tried arg parse.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.580
And somebody, I'm sorry, I forget who recommended this.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.180
There's a new thing called Appeal.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.520
A-P-P-E-A-L.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.160
And it's by Larry Hastings.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.100
And I'm like, oh, it's probably pretty cool.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.860
And it's got a great logo, like old retro.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.000
I don't know, like the 60s or something like that.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.140
Anyway, so one of the things about it is it's just really small.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.720
It doesn't have a whole bunch of boilerplate.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:41.780
So for instance, a hello world, you just import it, create an app, and do app command around it.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:46.100
And it just picks up that, like, say your hello function has a name to it.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.980
So the name is going to be an argument that you have to pass in.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.100
So that's neat.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.480
And then I'm like, okay, well, how about more complex things?

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.740
Well, things like optional stuff, like default values.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.960
Like, let's say I'm going to pass in a file name, like fgrep.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.540
You're going to pass in a file name.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.500
But it's optional.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.960
So you just say equals none.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.960
You just do type hints.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:17.660
So you're just saying that this is the command, or that fgrep is the command, but that it takes a pattern and an optional file name.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.580
And you tell it it's optional by just saying equals none.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.840
So using type hints more.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:30.380
I know that, like, typer was using type hints, but it still has, typer still has kind of a lot of boilerplate that you have to do.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.640
And so this is a very minimal API to get things done.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.040
And I'm pretty excited to try it.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.940
Also, look at the contributors.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:50.840
So there's only five contributors, but it's Larry Hastings, Hugo, Brett Cannon, Hinnick, and I don't know Peter, but wow, already.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.320
Yeah.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:51.720
Pretty cool.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.680
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.480
Looks very interesting.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.820
So anyway.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.460
Nice and simple.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.500
Nice and simple for command line interfaces.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.720
Worth a look.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.400
Okay.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.940
Do you know what else is worth a look?

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:02.940
Mm-hmm.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.920
I would like to tell everybody about Scout APM.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.880

Please use this link because it truly supports the show.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.660
Thank you, Scout APM, for supporting Python Bytes.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.280
Indeed.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.040
Thank you, Scout.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.280
Very cool product.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:12.820
Service.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:18.180
I'm going to shine a little light on something that hasn't got a ton of light on it yet, Brian.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:18.560
Okay.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.460
Something called Graphinate.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.080
That is the verb of to make a thing a graph, I guess.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.900
It is also a noun, the name of this project.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.340
Yeah.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:32.000
So this one comes to us from, one second.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.940
I ran Rivalis.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.700
And this is a project.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.700
It's Graphinate.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:45.300
Graphinate is a Python library that aims to simplify the creation of graphed data structures from just pure data sources.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.560
So probably the best way to get a sense of this is just look at some examples.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.860
So we go down.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.600
It's Badge.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.480
It's GetHub ReadMe Badge game is strong, by the way.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.120
Yeah.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:56.700
Wow.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:57.780
Yeah.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.940
So if we go down a little bit, you can see some examples.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:12.200
Like here is a visualization of a Python AST that looks a little bit like an advanced molecule based on benzene, but like a bunch of stuff coming off of it, I guess.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.820
Like a hexagonal thing in the middle.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.520
It's kind of cool.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:21.180
And then here is a relationship of some repositories and dependencies on GitHub.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:21.960
Very cool.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.260
Here's webpage links visualize.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.040
Ooh.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.840
Those are all nice visualizations, right?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.340
Yeah.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.480
That's beautiful.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.720
It looks like Dandelion fluff all connected together.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.220
Yeah.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.920
You can almost blow on it and like take out a whole segment of the internet.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.280
Yeah.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:44.680
And so the way to make this happen, if you go back up here, is you write a generator that defines the edges.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:55.660
So however you might iterate over your data source, I suppose you could even use like recursion with yield from and all sorts of things to like go through hierarchical data models and whatnot.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.600
So you just write a function called, here he calls it edge.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.520
It doesn't have to be called edge.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.640
You just give it a decorator called edge and whatever.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.800
And then you just say graph.materialize, create a model, create this function, boom.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.740
And then you get those pictures.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.880
That's pretty cool.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.380
Yeah.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:11.860
Yeah.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:12.680
It is.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.640
It is pretty cool.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:19.600
So anyway, I thought there must be a lot of people that want to have these graph databases.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.560
And Mike Fiedler says graphs, not charts.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.780
Important distinction there indeed.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.100
Yeah.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:32.140
So if you're doing graph type of work, even cyclical graphs seem to be supported as you can see for a benzene example.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.360
Not really benzene, AST example.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.640
So yeah, people can check that out.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.060
I think this is pretty neat.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.760
Benzene.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.900
You're such a nerd.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.020
I know.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.860
I love chemistry.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.300
That's pretty cool.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.540
Indeed.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.980
So short and sweet, but there it is.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.380
Yeah.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:47.820
Okay.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.300
Last topic.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.180
I want to talk about, do you know who David Lord is?

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.240
I have heard of him.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.540
Does he do stuff with the web?

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.260
I think he does.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:55.640
Yeah.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.880
So David Lord is, he's the lead maintainer of Flask, Jinja, Click, and a bunch of others.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.840
He works on a project called Palettes.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.360
He's also a PSF fellow.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.120
And as of like just recently, he finally has a blog.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.220
Yay, David.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.620
Anyway.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.580
So thanks, David, for starting a blog.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.820
Started this month.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.440
But he wrote this great article.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.200
I thought it's just sort of a brain dump.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.040
It's called a disorganized list of maintainer tasks.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.940
And it's not like maintainers really need to know what all they're doing.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:37.040
But I think people that use open source projects need to know what all maintainers do.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.660
And this list is pretty big.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.240
Yeah, like why isn't my feature already added for free with no effort from me?

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.100
That's what I wanted to highlight is next time when you want to ask, when is the next release?

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.080
Instead, look at the project and see where you can start getting involved.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.260
The more help maintainers have, the more they can get done.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.800
And I really love this message.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.620
Partly is looking through this list and saying, huh, if there's a project I want to work on,

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.620
or I'd like to have move faster, what could I help?

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:11.280
Like you could help automate the release process, document the manual process for releases.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.980
You might not know that stuff, though.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.980
So maybe improve the test coverage.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.220
I like that one.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.060
Maybe help update the docs.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:27.000
So a lot of these things I didn't think about, but they definitely are time consuming.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.520
One of them, I'm not going to be able to find it right away.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.280
Oh, here it is.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.540
Turning questions and answers into documentation improvements.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:39.660
So when you get questions on Mastodon or an email or something saying, hey, how do I do this?

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:44.060
That's a great place to put it in the documentation, but that is work.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.460
That's extra things that need done.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:51.260
So it'd be great to even reach out to a maintainer and say, hey, is there any parts of the documentation

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.540
that you'd like help with or something like that?

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.020
So I kind of love this and I'm kind of overwhelmed.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.620
My list is not this big, but wow, David, thanks for all your work.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.860
So if you look at Flask and GitHub, there's a little bit of attention on that project, right?

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.700
Like 65,000 stars, 16,000 forks.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.020
That's a high level of maintainer business, right?

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.300
Yeah.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.600
Yep.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.640
Yeah.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.820
There's a lot going on there.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.800
And Click.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.120
I've been kind of using Click more also.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.700
So there's a good projects.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.260
That's right.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:24.700
Yeah.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.740
So very cool.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.580
It's almost like a reverse lookup of how can I contribute to open source?

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.760
Yeah.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:37.460
And I actually, this is not, I think we covered like non-code contributors.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.080
This is all technical work.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.740
It's not non-technical.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.880
It's technical work to like answer questions and filter PRs and things like that.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.500
Yeah.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.000
All sorts of great things to help out with.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.600
All right.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.940
Well, those are our topics for the day.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.920
Do you have anything extra for us?

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.140
I have, I believe, three extras I want to cover real quick.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.240
Got a quick glimpse of them there as I was just showing the stars.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:08.540
First of all, in the weird world of marketing, it is Black Friday as of Monday.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.880
As of this, yeah.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.000
Starting this week.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.520
Yeah.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.960
I'm not a big fan of it, but people really appreciate it.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.120
I know they wait up for it.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.480
So over at Talk Python Training, we have a different deal this year than we had last year.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.420
And there's two cool aspects of it.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.080
So I just want to give a quick shout out and let people know like, hey, if you're looking

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.560
to take a course now would be in affordable time to do so.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.820
And there's a good cost.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:38.920
So what I'm doing this year is I took five of our most popular courses or most anticipated

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.840
courses that maybe are not even 100% done, but are almost done and put them out as early

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.240
access.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:51.480
So we have Visual Studio Code for the Python developers coming out, which is a really awesome

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.100
course.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.060
I'm just like, how do I change my Vs?

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.900
Go to do this and that.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.500
And what am I doing?

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.180
How do I make it do that?

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.940
So this is an early access by Brian Clark and Cecil Phillip.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.040
And we'll be out in a little bit, but you can sign up for it now.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.380
It's like two thirds of the way done.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.540
So it's still lots to get there.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:12.600
Async MongoDB with Beanie and Pydantic up and running with Git, like a more visual, more

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.360
beginner friendly way to get going with Git.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.980
Effective PyCharm because I love PyCharm.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.160
And our beginner course, all those are 50% off for the week.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.660
So that's our Black Friday.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.280
Nice.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:29.780
And the other part is we are taking 10% of the revenue and donating it to the Hidden Genius

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:36.720
Projects, which trains and mentors black male youth in technology, creation, entrepreneurship,

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.520
leadership.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.680
Basically, a lot of kids who are in places where they might not see a lot of hope or don't

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.780
think tech applies to them.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.120
And they run even up to like 15 month long, not an accelerator, that's not exactly fast,

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.460
but like mentorship journeys for them.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.820
And they've had like 10,000 students and we've done a lot of things at like PyCon and whatnot.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.360
So that's the other half.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.160
That's pretty cool.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:58.620
Yeah.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.280
Nice.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.180
Thanks.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:00.460
Okay.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.840
Two more.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.960
Python 3.13 Alpha is out.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.840
And boy, oh boy, how do you want to push your luck?

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.020
Friday, October 13th.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.180
So Friday the 13th, we're going to release Python 13 Alpha.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.940
No, I'm sure it's fine.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:18.680
I'm sure it's fine.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.220
But people can check out the new Alpha.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.960
If you want to start seeing what's coming and the new version.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.860
I mean, we just got 3.12, but it's now time to move on and start adding features to the Alpha.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.500
What do you think?

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.060
I think that's, sorry.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.160
I think that's great.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:40.760
I just reminded, I was reminded of a couple years ago, one of my kids said that they heard

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:46.560
somebody at school say, did you know that this year Halloween's going to be on Friday the 13th?

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.600
Maybe a little bit backwards.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.060
No, it's not going to be.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:56.800
So this is actually a little bit old, but I just realized I was up my list to talk about and I skipped it.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.740
But the 3.13 is already underway.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.220
People want to check it out, get going on.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:07.260
Yeah, we won't cover the new features that they're playing in, but maybe we can cover that in an upcoming episode.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.520
Yeah, we can go that, you know, new features will come.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.880
Alpha one is not the end of features or that's when we get to the beta.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.840
So that's quite a ways off.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.060
Yeah.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.620
More to come.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.040
Yeah.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:16.700
All right.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:24.180
Last thing from my extras is the PSF and JetBrains have over the last couple of years done their survey.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.740
Right.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.680
I think JetBrains is.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.120
Yeah.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.600
Again.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:33.800
So the Python developer survey for 2023 is now open for the taking as in take your time.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.300
Please go there, fill it out, submit your thoughts.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:42.980
And then in, I don't know what, a couple of months, six months, hopefully quicker than that, we'll get results.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.300
Now we can go talk about it.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:44.500
Right.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.500
But the way we can talk about it is if people take it.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:46.820
Right, Brian?

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.440
Yes.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.860
It's pretty cool that it's out already.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.740
I'm willing to think about it.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.220
I am as well.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.900
It'd be awesome if it came out while it was still in 2023.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.400
So we don't have to like explain.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:02.640
I know the results say for 2023 and it's 2024, but it actually applies to the most, you know what I mean?

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.880
That kind of talk.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:11.520
And Hugo also says Alpha 313, sorry, Python 313 Alpha 2 is due out today.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.340
So I just snuck in under the, this is super outdated news, Michael, deadline.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.100
What gives, man?

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.260
All right.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.040
That's it for my extras.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:20.360
Okay.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.080
Well, I just have a couple extras.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:31.020
I, this morning I met with the JetBrains and PyCharm team and did a webinar about, do you do enough testing, pytest to the rescue?

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.140
And it was really fun.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.100
It was Paul Everett and Helen Scott.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:40.540
And we had, had a lot of fun this morning and we had like 200 people show up, which was great.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.280
And then it's already had 500 views since three hours ago.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.040
So nice.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:45.480
That's awesome.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:46.760
It was fun.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.540
So check that out.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.000
People are wondering if they actually do do enough testing.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.420
And so they came to check it out.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.600
Well, and it's always fun when you're with Paul and those guys as well.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:55.840
Yeah.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.920
So the focus of this, I kind of got some technical stuff, especially with the parameterized IDs.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:08.360
Sorry about the nerdiness, but the, but the point was trying to get people to, to realize how easy it is to get starting.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.140
I'd like to get people, get people to not be afraid of it.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:17.220
Speaking of pytest, the pytest complete course or the complete pytest course is coming along.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:21.060
I have the, it's going to be 16 chapters.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.720
I've got 11 published already.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.520
The 12th is already recorded and the 13th should be recorded soon.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.840
So I'm definitely on track to getting this done this year.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.780
And it's, of course, it's all for sale.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:39.700
And I was going to ask you this after recording, but do you think it'd be a good idea to do a Black Friday sale?

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.760
Yeah, it might be.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.040
Okay.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.060
I suspect people would be interested in it.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:43.380
Okay.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.380
I'll probably set up that.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:53.920
So if you show up today before I get a chance and it's not there yet, I'll probably by tomorrow, I'll do have the Black Friday sale on.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.080
Yeah.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.720
Put the link in the show notes when you get it set.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.240
Nice.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:56.820
All right.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.880
Well, that's all of my extras.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.820
All right.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.380
Brian, do you know it's important to comment your code?

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.480
People tell you this, right?

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.800
Yeah.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.060
As long as the comments are right.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:06.520
Yeah.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.380
Well, sometimes people, that's part of it.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:14.860
Sometimes people can just mess up the comments or, you know, they might be inconsistent or they could just be boring.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.640
It could just not attract.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:23.800
Like you might leave the function with a hollow sense of this was just, there was no joy here.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.540
You know what I mean?

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:24.740
Okay.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.320
Okay.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.920
So here's a image that says the proper way to comment your code.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.920
Let me see how I can do.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.740
I did study math.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.420
So the function is called calculate circle area given and the parameter is a radius.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:36.740
Okay.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.100
Okay.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.460
And it does what you would expect.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.360
But the comment is even more than the function.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.720
It says in mathematical fields where circles weave with pies, grace, a mystic number.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:58.360
We conceive radiance orbs in their geometric trance circles, area poets, rhythmic dance 3.14159 are constant.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:05.420
True in pies, embrace the circle secrets do where radius meets its boundless quest area blooms in

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.680
geometries bequest.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.760
Then it does colon calculate circle area.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.520
It's nice, right?

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:12.840
Yeah.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.400
Yeah.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:19.720
I love also the, the, the, the, the, it's four lines of code and eight lines of comment.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.800
and, and that's never going to be wrong.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.660
right.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.800
I mean, that's, I think that's our takeaway is yes.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.640
As long as your comments are just loosely related to the code below it, it's probably not going

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.400
to be wrong ever.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.260
So you're good.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.900
I just want to call this function for the joy of the, yeah.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.660
The description.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:45.660
and Peter beans points out, indeed, this is where AI might help you write some code.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.240
Oh gosh.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.980
Dear, dear, copilot thing.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.580
Write me a poem about this function.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.600
That's awesome.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.380
I think I can totally do it.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:03.940
That's a great use of, of, AI and ChatGPT and try it now before the entire system

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.980
explodes and implodes on itself.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.480
Exactly.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.000
There's some drama in that world right now.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:09.220
Yeah.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:09.220
Yeah.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:09.240
Yeah.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.280
Yeah.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:09.500
Yeah.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.460
More of a shift, a fresh, like a weird dramatic shift.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.340
Not anyway, people go check the news.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:22.320
And with that, Brian, I bid you happy poem and haiku writing for your code.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.120
Yeah.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.960
I'm more of a limerick man, but you know.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.480
Okay.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.080
Fair.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.380
We can make that happen.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.220
All right.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.020
Thanks a lot.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.520
And thanks everybody for listening.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.640
Thank you for showing up and to the, to the live episode and everybody listening later.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.480
We love you.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.240
Talk to you later.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:37.620
Bye.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.120
Yep.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:38.740
See y'all later.
