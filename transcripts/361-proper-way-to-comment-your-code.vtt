00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.860
Not required, certainly,


00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.120
not intended to be required,


00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.200
but fun to have them there.


00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.120
>> Yeah. What do you got for us first?


00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.720
>> Well, very excited to be back together on the eve of Turkey Day,


00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.160
the Turkey Eve.


00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.640
So happy Turkey Eve by the eve of Turkey Eve.


00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.920
>> Eve squared.


00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.120
>> Yeah.


00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.640
>> Two eve, I don't know how this multiplies together.


00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.720
Let's start talking about something snarky,


00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.080
aka Brett Cannon.


00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.520
So Brett Cannon did a nice write-up here about different keyboards.


00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.080
Brian, I know you're a fan of ergonomic keyboards.


00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.960
I am definitely a fan of the ergonomic keyboards,


00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.480
having had serious RSI issues at one point in my career.


00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.680
Basically, if I type on a laptop keyboard for a week, I have to quit.


00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.440
I'm going to quit my job, I'd be done.


00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.800
It's that bad, right?


00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.040
I'm not making it up,


00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.760
like the carpal tunnel stuff is real.


00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.760
But with the right keyboard,


00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.160
I can literally type 10 hours a day, no problem at all.


00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.320
So choosing a keyboard is something I wish I'd paid more attention to when I was younger,


00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.040
but it's super, super important.


00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.400
Brett had his nice write-up on it,


00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.520
so that's what I'm going to cover today.


00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.920
>> Cool.


00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.000
>> So basically, he says, "Look,


00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.520
here's what I care about.


00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.040
I have a bunch of different concerns."


00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.120
So for him, it was more his back that was causing him problems,


00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.680
but he was looking to get a fully split keyboard.


00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.680
He went from something like my keyboard,


00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.920
which I'll give a shout out to in a second,


00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.520
to a completely split,


00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.600
which means the keyboard,


00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.040
the part your left hand touches and the part your right hand touches are not attached,


00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.240
at least not physically, maybe through a wire just so they communicate.


00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.000
So well, okay, how do we go?


00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.440
Talks about all the considerations,


00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.040
all the things that he cares about,


00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.000
and then goes through a nice long list of things.


00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.240
What is he used before?


00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.920
The requirements are must be fully split because


00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.800
he's using ergonomic one that's not fully split now,


00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.840
and this is his goal.


00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.240
It must tent, as in it must,


00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.880
from the two edges,


00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.520
the middle must raise up and down.


00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.520
So if you rotate your hands,


00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.000
I don't know, like this, without moving your arms at all,


00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.560
you just left or right like a clock,


00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.080
that kind of rotation,


00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.520
wants some portability, interestingly,


00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.360
aesthetically pleasing to his wife because it has to be visible and somewhat programmable.


00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.360
So I don't want to go through his whole article.


00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.240
I just want to give a shout out to a bunch of


00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.000
different keyboards and you'll get your thoughts as well.


00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.480
>> Okay.


00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.520
>> Okay. First of all, he says, "Hey, look,


00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.240
I'm using," I think he was using,


00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.920
or at least was considering and put it into the category of,


00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.280
the Microsoft Surface ergonomic keyboard.


00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.120
That's a fine looking little keyboard right there.


00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.560
>> Yeah.


00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.800
>> It's like a full-size keyboard or


00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.960
100 percent keyboard where it has the numbers and all of that.


00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.120
The numpad thing in addition to the numbers on the top, of course.


00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.920
It's fixed, tented, I guess you would call it.


00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.440
It's got a really good curve to it,


00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.120
but the curve you can't adjust.


00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.920
You can lean it.


00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.280
So the starting point where your arms start to touch,


00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.120
is higher than the other one if you want and so on.


00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.080
But I actually got this when it first came out.


00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.520
Maybe something's changed.


00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.360
But when this first came out, I'm like, "Oh, this looks great.


00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.160
I'm going to give this a try as an alternative to the one that I use."


00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.200
You know what? Unbelievably, even though it's Bluetooth,


00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.240
it doesn't work on macOS at all.


00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.000
So if you want to use this and using Windows, it looks pretty cool.


00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.240
If you're not using Windows,


00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.200
it's more like paperweight than it is a keyboard.


00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.160
Maybe something about this has changed.


00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.520
But I mean, I took it when Microsoft had Microsoft stores like Apple stores,


00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.280
I took it back and I said, "Guys, I bought this.


00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.080
I can't seem to make it work on my MacBook. Can you?"


00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.600
They're like, "Oh, yeah, sure. Of course it does."


00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.000
I'm like, "All right. Here we go. Let's see."


00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.880
No. No, they couldn't get it to work either.


00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.440
>> See, I thought I've tried one.


00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.280
I thought I tried one on a Mac a couple of years ago.


00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.760
>> Possible. I use the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic,


00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.920
which is not the Microsoft Sculpt Surface Ergonomic.


00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.200
>> This is the one I tried.


00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.080
>> That works everywhere. Yes, that works everywhere.


00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.120
That works everywhere and it's smaller and it's lighter,


00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.000
and I think it's actually better across the board having had both.


00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.400
This one is fine. The Surface one,


00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.360
this one doesn't work.


00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.800
So another one he said,


00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.200
some people really like the Apple Magic Keyboard,


00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.480
which is more art, less functionality.


00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.920
It's very standard for Apple hardware,


00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.680
save them, put the Macs and iPhone stuff aside.


00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.480
But the accessories, it's like,


00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.800
can we just make it beautiful?


00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.480
I don't care if it's the most uncomfortable thing you've ever touched,


00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.040
like the Magic Mouse or anything.


00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.000
This is like, I want Carpal Tunnel next week.


00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.640
I don't have it now. How can I get it? Let's try this.


00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.920
So I don't necessarily recommend that.


00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.640
Then it starts going through the real ergonomic ones that people might consider.


00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.600
Starting with the Advantage 2 Keyboard from Kinesis.


00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.560
This is one of the weirder, more different ones.


00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.440
>> This is what I got. This is what I've been using for decades.


00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.960
>> Describe this for people.


00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.640
>> Because it's unusual.


00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.840
>> Well, it seems unusual.


00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.440
>> Not in a bad way.


00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.600
>> But it's a split keyboard where you've got


00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.360
basically divots where your fingers go because your fingers are like,


00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.560
they're not flat like a keyboard, they're curved around.


00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.440
>> It's like if somebody dug a hole for the keys.


00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.280
>> Yeah, it matches the way your fingers move.


00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.720
Then because when programming,


00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.120
we do things like hit escape and all sorts of other stuff,


00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.400
and enter and backspace and home and all that stuff all the time.


00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.920
Instead of having your pinkies do that work,


00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.280
they put those keys in the middle so your thumbs can do it.


00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.840
I really love that. One of the first things I do is because I'm


00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.440
a VI user or Vim user is I map one of those middle ones to escape.


00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.920
Because it's programmable too, so it's nice.


00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.160
>> Yeah, that's one of the big,


00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.200
as you started to explore it,


00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.280
it's one of the big areas is like,


00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.560
what does your thumbs do versus not just space bar,


00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.400
but your thumbs become way more active.


00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.160
>> Yeah. By programmable,


00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.600
I don't mean that you have to write a program for it.


00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.000
I mean, there's a key sequence you can say,


00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.520
I want to remap this key to this other place and it's pretty easy.


00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.320
>> Yeah, absolutely. All right.


00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.320
So that was one that was on the list of considerations.


00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.680
We'll see how many more of these you've experienced.


00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.800
So we have the Moonlander Mark 1.


00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.760
>> I've wanted to try that. It looks great.


00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.600
It's nice and lit up.


00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.720
It's quite cool.


00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.120
It looks like it almost has like a track,


00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.360
those little nipple things that come on the ThinkPads.


00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.400
I could use like a, it's not a ball,


00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.560
but it's like a stick that's like a joystick for the mouse almost.


00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.920
>> Yeah.


00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.560
>> Yeah, this one looks pretty interesting.


00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.200
It's lit up. You can, I think,


00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.560
program it, but this one's quite cool.


00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.080
It's fully split and it's got these little bars for the tinting.


00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.560
So you can adjust like how side to side it's like bent,


00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.000
which is pretty neat, I think. What do you think about this one?


00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.600
>> I'd like to use that.


00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.800
But one of the interesting bits is the middle keys are,


00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.400
they're just blank because you can map whatever you want to them.


00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.720
But a bunch of other blank ones,


00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.880
I'd rather have some replacement ones


00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.920
because I'm really not going to remember how I mapped them.


00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.160
>> Just got to sharpie them.


00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.360
>> Sharpie them.


00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.080
>> I guess.


00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.080
>> Yeah, no kidding.


00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.120
>> Yeah.


00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.440
>> Yeah. The other thing that I think about a lot is like,


00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.760
these keys look like they have a long up and down like key throw.


00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.360
Like the travel of the key seems high and the travel of the keys on


00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.720
the Sculpt ergonomic one is incredibly small,


00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.560
like probably less than on a MacBook.


00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.480
So you could just barely move your fingers when you're typing.


00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.640
Some of these, it's like the mechanical style of like lots of hand movement.


00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.960
Not a fan of it, but that's more than I can handle.


00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.960
>> I like mechanical. Yeah.


00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.080
>> In theory, I do.


00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.960
Another one is the Kinesis Gaming.


00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.080
Since you're a fan of Kinesis,


00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.200
have you looked at this thing?


00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.800
>> No, it's flat.


00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.120
>> No, you can tilt it.


00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.440
>> No, but it doesn't have the divots.


00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.080
>> Oh, I see. I see. Got you.


00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.640
I know what you mean. It has no holes dug for the keys.


00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.120
>> Yeah.


00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.480
>> Yeah. This is pretty interesting.


00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.600
You can tilt it a lot,


00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.680
but it is just like if you want the least weird keyboard,


00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.160
but you want to separate it.


00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.360
So you can get the right orientation of


00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.160
your wrist and stuff without causing trouble.


00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.640
This is pretty good. We've got


00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.160
the Dygma Raise which is also-


00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.080
>> I've never heard of this one.


00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.080
>> Quite an interesting one. Yeah.


00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.960
It's similar to the gaming one.


00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.240
I think it's a little bit neater.


00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.400
It looks like it has pretty far key throw,


00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.400
but it clicks together and then it clicks apart.


00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.840
So that's something people might care about.


00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.640
>> Nice magnets to mess up your phone with that you set next to it.


00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.920
>> Exactly. There's the Ergo Docks Easy, which is another one.


00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.760
Lots of adjustability on how it's oriented in things,


00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.720
which is cool.


00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.680
Very thumb friendly,


00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.360
but no marking drive for the programmability.


00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.520
So you're going to need a white Sharpie for this one.


00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.360
>> Yeah.


00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:34.800
>> Yeah.


00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.280
>> Looks fun.


00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.000
>> The ultimate hacking keyboard was Barry Warsaw recommended this one,


00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.440
which it comes with a built-in trackball


00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.720
looking thing in the middle for one of your thumbs.


00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.340
>> Nice.


00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:45.920
>> Yeah.


00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.560
>> Okay.


00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.640
>> Notice also it has the QWERTY.


00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.000
See this hop, it says QWERTY for a display.


00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.520
So you can switch it into different modes like Dvorak.


00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.720
Liz out in the audience says,


00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.800
"I'm a fan of Dvorak."


00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.160
>> Yeah.


00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.200
>> Pretty cool. Yeah. We have the Advantage 360 keyboard.


00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.200
>> That's on my want list.


00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.840
>> How's this different than the one that you have already?


00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.160
>> Well, it's split.


00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.600
So it's completely split.


00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.480
>> It's a fully split one.


00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.000
>> Yeah. The Advantage 2 is actually connected together,


00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.440
but this one's split and it's spread apart.


00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.040
>> Got it.


00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.040
>> And it can tent.


00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.240
>> Yes. It definitely looks like a content.


00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.480
The one that he actually went more I believe went for is


00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.480
the Dygma Defy so you can define your limits with this one,


00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.240
which looks pretty genius as well.


00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.440
It's so animated you can hardly see a picture of it,


00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.600
but links for all these in the show notes.


00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.120
But this one is thumb heavy, Brian.


00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.280
Look at how many options your thumb gets to play with there.


00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.800
>> Oh, I like it. Yeah.


00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.360
>> Yeah. So apparently this one takes a little while to get.


00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.200
But anyway, I wanted to go through this because


00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.000
I know there's a lot of people out there who might.


00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.400
>> Even if he decided on this one,


00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.640
this is the one he decided on now.


00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.200
Next month he'll order another one, I'm sure.


00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.360
>> I know. I know exactly how it feels.


00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.960
But no, I think honestly,


00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.120
someone who's had hand issues,


00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.640
don't skimp on keyboards.


00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.360
Don't just think, well, it's weird,


00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.360
so I'm not going to try it.


00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.760
Honestly, it's worth not


00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.160
doing something that's just square that is your laptop.


00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.840
>> Yeah. Also stand up and walk


00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.680
around and shake yourself out once in a while.


00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.200
>> Exactly.


00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:17.600
>> Ten hours sitting.


00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.800
>> We'll get a chair that just every so often,


00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.200
the chair just springs you over in the back and flings you out.


00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.720
It encourages you to get up before that happens.


00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.640
>> It's actually one of the things I like about the Apple Watch.


00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.880
It says, "Hey, you should stand up."


00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.280
>> I know. It's usually great,


00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.600
except for when you're in an airplane.


00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.120
You should get up and walk around like,


00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.160
"You know what? I'm in the middle seat.


00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.800
I don't think I'm going to right now."


00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.600
Thanks, Apple Watch. Maybe I feel even more stuck where I am.


00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.800
Well, that's it for my first item. What you got?


00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.680
>> Okay. Well, I want to talk about a command line interface tool.


00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.560
I just a couple of things.


00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.120
I just wrote a blog post about testing command line interfaces,


00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.600
particularly ArgParse.


00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.600
I should put a link in that and the extras.


00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.200
But also, I was covering that when I was recording


00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.520
the pytest course talking about testing command line interfaces.


00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.880
I tried a few. I went back and tried Click,


00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.480
I tried ArgParse.


00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.240
I'm sorry, I forget who recommended this.


00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.320
There's a new thing called Appeal,


00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.720
A-P-E-A-L, and it's by Larry Hastings.


00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.320
I'm like, "It's probably pretty cool."


00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.800
It's got a great logo,


00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.280
like old retro, I don't know,


00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.560
like the '60s or something like that.


00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.240
Anyway, one of the things about it is it's just really small.


00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.400
It doesn't have a whole bunch of boilerplate.


00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.160
For instance, a Hello World,


00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.720
you just import it,


00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.880
create an app, and do app command around it.


00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.600
It just picks up that, say,


00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.040
your Hello function has a name to it.


00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.240
The name is going to be an argument that you have to pass in.


00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.560
That's neat. Then I'm like,


00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.680
"Okay, well, how about more complex things?"


00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.960
Well, things like optional stuff, like default values.


00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.200
Let's say I pass in a file name,


00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.040
like fgrep, you're going to pass in a file name,


00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.840
but it's optional.


00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.360
You just say equals none, you just do type hints.


00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.800
You're just saying that this is the command,


00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.200
but or that fgrep is the command,


00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.280
but that it takes a pattern.


00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.680
An optional file name,


00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.040
and you tell it it's optional by just saying equals none.


00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.000
Using type hints more,


00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.560
I know that Typer was using type hints,


00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.960
but Typer still has a lot of boilerplate that you have to do.


00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.680
This is a very minimal API to get things done,


00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.240
and I'm pretty excited to try it.


00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.120
Also, look at the contributors.


00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.120
There's only five contributors,


00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.040
but it's Larry Hastings,


00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.280
Hugo, Brett Cannon, Henik,


00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.520
and I don't know, Peter,


00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.040
but wow, already.


00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.360
>> Yeah.


00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:51.920
>> Pretty cool.


00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.120
>> Yeah, that's pretty cool. It looks very interesting.


00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.920
>> Anyway.


00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.600
>> Nice and simple.


00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.160
>> Nice and simple for command line interfaces.


00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.080
Worth a look.


00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.760
Do you know what else is worth a look?


00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.120
I would like to tell everybody about Scout APM.


00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.640
Thank you, Scout APM,


00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.160
for sponsoring this episode.


00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.440
Are you tired of spending hours trying to find


00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.800
the root cause of issues impacting performance?


00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.640
Then you owe it to yourself to check out


00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.600
our sponsor this week, Scout APM.


00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.440
Scout APM is a leading Python application


00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.640
performance monitoring tool that helps you


00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.080
identify and solve performance abnormalities faster and easier.


00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.240
Scout APM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks,


00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.720
slow database queries, background jobs,


00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.000
the dreaded N plus one queries problem,


00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
common with ORMs and more,


00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.200
directly to source codes so you can spend


00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.280
less time debugging and more time building.


00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.960
You'll love Scout because it's


00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.960
built for developers by developers.

Seriously, you could pause this episode,


00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.680
set up Scout, and be back at it without missing a beat,


00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.080
and probably be backed by the jokes. That'd be cool.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.360
Thank you, Scout APM,


00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.880
for supporting Python Bytes.


00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.240
>> Indeed. Thank you, Scout.


00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.480
Very cool product.


00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.120
>> Service.


00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.360
>> I'm going to shine a little light on something that


00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.320
hasn't got a ton of light on it yet, Brian.


00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:18.680
>> Okay.


00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.040
>> Something called Graphinate.


00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.720
That is the verb of to make a thing a graph, I guess.


00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.080
It is also a noun, the name of this project.


00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.480
Yeah. So this one comes to us from, one second.


00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.760
I ran Rivelus, and this is a project,


00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.560
it's Graphinate, is a Python library that aims to


00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.560
simplify the creation of


00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.640
graphed data structures from just pure data sources.


00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.160
So probably the best way to get a sense of this,


00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.800
is just look at some examples.


00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.240
So we go down.


00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.640
It's Badge.


00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.680
It's GitHub ReadMe Badge game is strong, by the way.


00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.120
>> Yeah. Wow.


00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.960
>> Yeah. So if we go down a little bit,


00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.160
you can see some examples like here is a visualization of


00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.120
a Python AST that looks a little bit like


00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.240
an advanced molecule based on Benzene,


00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.240
but a bunch of stuff coming off of it, I guess,


00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.960
like a hexagonal thing in the middle.


00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.000
It's cool. Then here's a relationship


00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.440
of some repositories and dependencies on GitHub.


00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.880
Very cool. Here's web page links visualize.


00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.960
Those are all nice visualizations, right?


00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.680
>> Yeah. That's beautiful.


00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.920
Looks like Dandelion fluff all connected together.


00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.360
>> Yeah. You can almost blow on it and


00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.040
take out a whole segment of the Internet.


00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.280
>> Yeah.


00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.920
>> So the way to make this happen,


00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.720
if you go back up here,


00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.840
is you write a generator that defines the edges.


00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.920
So however you might iterate over your data source.


00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.520
I suppose you could even use recursion with


00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.440
yield from and all sorts of things to


00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.080
go through hierarchical data models and whatnot.


00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.280
So you just write a function called,


00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.640
here he calls it edge,


00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.600
it doesn't have to be called edge.


00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.000
You just give it a decorator called edge and whatever.


00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.600
Then you just say graph.materialize,


00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.560
create a model, create this function,


00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.000
boom, and then you get those pictures.


00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.120
>> That's pretty cool.


00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.520
>> Yeah?


00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.040
>> Yeah.


00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.720
>> It is. It's pretty cool.


00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.840
So anyway, I thought there must be a lot of people that


00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.200
want to have these graph databases.


00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.640
Mike Fiedler says, "Graphs not charts,


00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.920
important distinction there indeed."


00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.600
Yeah. So if you're doing graph type of work,


00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.440
even cyclical graph seem to be supported,


00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.400
as you can see for a benzene example,


00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.800
not really benzene, AST example.


00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.680
So people can check that out.


00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.200
I think this is pretty neat.


00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.400
>> Benzene, you're such a nerd.


00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.320
>> I know. I love chemistry.


00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.840
>> That's pretty cool.


00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.080
>> Indeed. So short and sweet, but there it is.


00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:51.040
>> Yeah. Okay. Last topic I want to talk about.


00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.400
Do you know who David Lord is?


00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.320
>> I have heard of him. Does he do stuff with the web? I think he does.


00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.280
>> Yeah. So David Lord,


00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.160
he's the lead maintainer of Flask,


00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.960
Jinja, Click, and a bunch of others.


00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.080
He works on a project called Pallets.


00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.160
He's also a PSF fellow.


00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.720
As of just recently,


00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.280
he finally has a blog.


00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.240
Yay, David. Anyway.


00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.720
So thanks, David, for starting a blog.


00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.000
It started this month.


00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.680
But he wrote this great article.


00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.380
I thought it's just a brain dump.


00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.000
It's called a disorganized list of maintainer tasks.


00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
It's not like maintainers really need to know what all they're doing,


00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.640
but I think people that use


00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.800
open-source projects need to know what all maintainers do.


00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.720
This list is pretty big.


00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.200
>> Yeah. Why is it my feature already added for free?


00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.520
>> Yeah.


00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.240
>> No effort for me.


00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.440
>> That's what I wanted to highlight,


00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.720
is next time when you want to ask,


00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.320
when is the next release?


00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.460
Instead, look at the project and see where you can start getting involved.


00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.120
The more help maintainers have,


00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.400
the more they can get done.


00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.280
I really love this message.


00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.760
Partly, is looking through this list and saying,


00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.640
if there's a project I want to work on or I'd like to have move faster,


00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.960
what could I help?


00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.680
You could help automate the release process,


00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.440
document the manual process for releases.


00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.040
You might not know that stuff though,


00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.080
so maybe improve the test coverage.


00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.580
I like that one.


00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:22.160
Maybe help update the docs.


00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.600
A lot of these things I didn't think about,


00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.200
but they definitely are time-consuming.


00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.680
One of them, I'm not going to be able to find it right away.


00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.000
Here it is, turning questions and answers into documentation improvements.


00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.720
When you get questions on Mastodon or an e-mail or something saying,


00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.240
"Hey, how do I do this?"


00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.240
That's a great place to put it in the documentation,


00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.920
but that is work, that's extra things that need done.


00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.520
It'd be great to even reach out to a maintainer and say,


00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.720
"Hey, is there any parts of


00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.240
the documentation that you'd like help with or something like that?"


00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.320
I love this and I'm overwhelmed.


00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.960
My list is not this big,


00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.920
but wow, David, thanks for all your work.


00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.560
>> If you look at Flask and GitHub,


00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.120
there's a little bit of attention on that project.


00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.720
65,000 stars, 16,000 forks,


00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.080
that's a high level of maintainer business, right?


00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.200
>> Yeah. There's a lot going on there.


00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.000
Click, I've been using Click more also.


00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.200
There's a good projects.


00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.560
>> Yeah. Very cool. It's almost like a reverse lookup


00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.080
of how can I contribute to open source?


00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:38.120
>> Yeah. I think we covered non-code contributors.


00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.160
This is all technical work.


00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.880
It's not non-technical,


00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.480
it's a technical work to answer questions and filter PRs and things like that.


00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.160
All great things to help out with.


00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.120
>> All right. Well, those are our topics for the day.


00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.920
Do you have anything extra for us?


00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.040
>> I have, I believe,


00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.200
three extras I want to cover real quick.


00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.480
You got a quick glimpse of them there as I was just showing the stars.


00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.160
First of all, in the weird world of marketing,


00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.960
it is Black Friday as of Monday.


00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.000
>> As of this, yeah.


00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.080
>> Starting this week.


00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.600
I'm not a big fan of it,


00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.960
but people really appreciate it.


00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.320
I know they wait up for it.


00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.160
Over at TalkBython training,


00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.600
we have a different deal this year than we had last year,


00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.760
and there's two cool aspects of it.


00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.080
I just wanted to give a quick shout out and let people know,


00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.040
hey, if you're looking to take a course,


00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.720
now would be an affordable time to do so,


00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.120
and there's a good cost.


00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.200
What I'm doing this year is I took five of our most popular courses or


00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.800
most anticipated courses that maybe are not even 100 percent done,


00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.640
but are almost done, and put them out as early access.


00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:50.040
We have Visual Studio Code for the Python developers coming out,


00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.160
which is a really awesome course.


00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.000
I'm just like, how do I change my view?


00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.720
It's good to do this and that, and what am I doing?


00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.520
How do I make it do that?


00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.200
This is an early access by Brian Clark and Cecil Philip,


00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.960
and we'll be out in a little bit,


00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.120
but you can sign up for it now.


00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.520
It's like two-thirds of the way done,


00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.840
so still lots to get there.


00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.760
Async MongoDB with Beanie and Pydantic,


00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.920
up and running with Git,


00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.280
like a more visual,


00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.560
more beginner-friendly way to get going with Git.


00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.280
Effective PyCharm because I love PyCharm,


00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.200
and our beginner course.


00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.520
All those are 50 percent off for the week.


00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.880
That's our Black Friday.


00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.720
>> Nice.


00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.040
>> The other part is,


00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:30.600
we are taking 10 percent of the revenue and donating it to the Hidden Genius Projects,


00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.000
which trains and mentors black male youth in technology,


00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.760
creation, entrepreneurship, leadership.


00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.760
Basically, a lot of kids who are in places where they might not see


00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.880
a lot of hope or don't think tech applies to them,


00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.920
and they run even up to 15 months long.


00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.200
Not an accelerator, that's not exactly fast,


00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.840
but mentorship journeys for them.


00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.240
They've had 10,000 students and we've done a lot of things at PyCon and whatnot.


00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.480
That's the other half.


00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.360
>> That's pretty cool.


00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:58.880
>> Yeah.


00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.720
>> Nice.


00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.000
>> Thanks. Two more.


00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.040
Python 3.13 Alpha is out,


00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.040
and boy, how do you want to push your luck?


00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.280
Friday, October 13th.


00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:16.360
Friday the 13th, we're going to release Python 13 Alpha.


00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.680
No, I'm sure it's fine.


00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.320
But people can check out the new Alpha.


00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.080
If you want to start seeing what's coming in the new version,


00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.240
we just got 3.12,


00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.800
but it's now time to move on and start adding features to the Alpha. What do you think?


00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.320
>> I think that's great.


00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.040
I was reminded of a couple of years ago,


00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:43.040
one of my kids said that they heard somebody at school say,


00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.840
"Did you know that this year,


00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.160
Halloween is going to be on Friday the 13th?"


00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.760
>> Maybe a little bit backwards.


00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.080
>> No, it's not going to be.


00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.880
>> This is actually a little bit old,


00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.800
but I just realized I was on my list to talk about and I skipped it.


00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.840
But Python 3.13 is already underway.


00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.200
People want to check it out, get going on it.


00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.760
>> Yeah, we won't cover the new features that they're planning,


00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.520
but maybe we can cover that in an upcoming episode.


00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.760
>> Yeah, we can go to that. New features will come.


00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.800
Alpha 1 is not the end of features.


00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.920
That's when we get to the beta, so that's quite a ways off.


00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.120
>> Yeah.


00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.720
>> More to come. Yeah. All right.


00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.640
Last thing from my extras is


00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:24.560
the PSF and JetBrains have over the last couple of years done their survey.


00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.920
I think JetBrains is, yeah, again.


00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:32.400
The Python Developer Survey for 2023 is now open for the taking,


00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.000
as in take your time,


00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.320
please go there, fill it out,


00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.760
submit your thoughts, and then in, I don't know what,


00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.480
a couple of months, six months,


00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.240
hopefully quicker than that, we'll get results.


00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.440
Now, we can go talk about it.


00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.000
But the way we can talk about it is that people take it, right, Brian?


00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.120
>> Yes. It's pretty cool that it's out already.


00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.080
I'm wanting to think about it.


00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.240
>> I am as well. It'd be awesome if it came out while it was still in 2023,


00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.680
so we don't have to explain.


00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.680
I know the results say for 2023 and it's 2024,


00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.240
but it actually applies to the most,


00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.560
you know what I mean, that kind of talk.


00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.960
Hugo also says, "Alpha 3.13,


00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.840
sorry, Python 3.13 Alpha 2 is due out today."


00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.480
I just snuck in under the,


00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.880
this is super outdated news, Michael, deadline.


00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.120
>> What gives, man?


00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.120
>> All right. That's it for my extras.


00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.080
>> Okay. Well, I just have a couple of extras.


00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.760
This morning, I met with the JetBrains and PyCharm team and did


00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.060
a webinar about do you do enough testing,


00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.160
pytest to the rescue, and it was really fun.


00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.280
It was Paul Everett and Helen Scott,


00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.080
and we had a lot of fun this morning.


00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.720
We had like 200 people show up, which was great.


00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.640
Then it's already had 500 views since three hours ago.


00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.920
>> That's awesome.


00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.680
>> It was fun, so check that out.


00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.440
>> People are wondering if they actually do do


00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.440
enough testing and so they came to check it out.


00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.200
>> Well, and the-


00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.640
>> It's always fun when you're with Paul and those guys as well.


00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.840
>> Yeah. The focus of this,


00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.800
I got some technical stuff,


00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.280
especially with the parameterized IDs.


00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.640
Sorry about the nerdiness.


00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.600
But the point was trying to get people


00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.480
to realize how easy it is to get starting.


00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.400
I'd like to get people to not be afraid of it.


00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.120
Speaking of pytest, the pytest complete course,


00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.280
or the complete pytest course is coming along.


00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.400
It's going to be 16 chapters.


00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.960
I've got 11 published already.


00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.960
The 12th is already recorded and the 13th should be recorded soon.


00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.480
I'm definitely on track to getting this done this year.


00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.640
Of course, it's all for sale.


00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.200
I was going to ask you this after recording,


00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.080
but do you think it'd be a good idea to do a Black Friday sale?


00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.080
>> Yeah, it might be. I suspect people would be interested in it.


00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.600
>> Okay. I'll probably set up that.


00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.400
If you show up today before I get a chance and it's not there yet,


00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.800
I'll probably by tomorrow,


00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.040
I'll do have the Black Friday sale on there.


00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.880
>> Yeah, I'll put the link in the show notes when you get it set.


00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.240
>> Nice. All right. Well, that's all of my extras.


00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.600
>> All right. Brian, you know it's important to comment your code.


00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.080
People tell you this, right?


00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.240
>> Yeah, as long as the comments are right.


00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.480
>> Yeah. Well, that's part of it.


00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.640
Sometimes people can just mess up the comments or they might be inconsistent,


00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.160
or they could just be boring.


00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.160
It could just not attract.


00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.520
You might leave the function with a hollow sense of,


00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.960
this was just, there was no joy here.


00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.440
You know what I mean?


00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:24.920
>> Okay.


00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.240
>> Okay. Here's an image that says,


00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.480
this is the proper way to comment your code.


00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.320
Let me see how I can do. I did study math.


00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.840
So the function is called calculate circle area given,


00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.440
and the parameters are radius, okay?


00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:37.920
>> Okay.


00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.480
>> It does what you would expect.


00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.160
But the comment is even more than the function.


00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.120
It says, "In mathematical fields where circles weave,


00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.280
with pi's grace, a mystic number we conceive,


00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.120
radiance orbs in their geometric trance circles area,


00:27:53.120 --> 00:28:00.200
make dance 3.14159 are constant true in pi's embrace.


00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.320
The circle secrets do.


00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.400
Where radius meets its boundless quest,


00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.360
area blooms in geometries bequest."


00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.800
Then it does colon calculate circle area.


00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.560
It's nice, right?


00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:20.480
>> Yeah. I love also that it's four lines of code and eight lines of comment.


00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.880
>> Exactly.


00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.760
>> That's never going to be wrong, right?


00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.360
I think that's our takeaway.


00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:28.840
>> Yes.


00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.720
>> As long as your comments are just loosely related to the code below it,


00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.400
it's probably not going to be wrong ever. So you're good.


00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.680
>> You just want to call this function for the joy of the description.


00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.160
Peter Beans points out, indeed,


00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.960
this is where AI might help you write some code.


00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.360
>> Oh, gosh.


00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.200
>> Dear copilot thing,


00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.200
write me a poem about this function.


00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.040
>> That's awesome.


00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.520
>> I think it can totally do it.


00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.920
>> That's a great use of AI in ChatGPT.


00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:06.160
Try it now before the entire system explodes and implodes on itself.


00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.040
>> Exactly. There's some drama in that world right now.


00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.560
>> Yeah.


00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.160
>> More of a shift,


00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.520
like a weird dramatic shift.


00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.000
Not anyway, people can check the news.


00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.280
With that, Brian, I bid you


00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.760
happy poem and haiku writing for your code.


00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.960
>> I'm more of a limerick man.


00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.920
>> Okay. Fair. We can make that happen.


00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.960
>> Thanks a lot and thanks everybody for listening.


00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.920
Thank you for showing up to the live episode and everybody listening later.


00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.840
We love you. Talk to you later. Bye.


00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.200
>> Yep. See you all later. Bye.
