00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is Python Bytes, Python news and headlines delivered directly to your earbuds.


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.500
This is February 21st, 2017.


00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
I'm Michael Kennedy here with my co-host Brian Okken.


00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Hey Brian, how's it going man?


00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.000
Going great.


00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We have some really cool stuff to talk about.


00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
As usual, the Python ecosystem is bursting with good things to discuss.


00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Yeah, definitely is.


00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.500
So let's start with like a little reference book that we can use to stay on top of Python


00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.180
And specifically, modern Python, Python 3.


00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.380
Yeah, so Matt Harrison has self-published quite a few books already.


00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.460
And this one, I assume he self-published this one,


00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.740
but it's a tiny Python 3.6 notebook.


00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.300
And he released it on GitHub,


00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.700
and he also has a physical copy for sale on Amazon.


00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.660
Anyway, I guess I'll just quote his introduction.


00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.260
He said, "This is not so much as an instructional manual,


00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.180
but rather notes, tables, and examples for Python syntax.


00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.260
And I think it's pretty awesome.


00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.060
It's like all of the syntax and everything


00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.020
boiled down into just the fax man sort of thing.


00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.860
It's like the pocket Python reference that you need, right?


00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.960
Yeah, and I like it even online, but it's one big long file.


00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.020
I think he's got it priced at less than $10.


00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.760
So I'm going to give it a shot and try


00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.440
the physical copy because I think that might be kind of a nice thing to have around.


00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.520
Yeah, yeah. Do you know if there's an e-book version?


00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.680
I think, yeah, I think there is an e-book version.


00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.760
Sweet, sweet, sweet. My whole library lives on my Kindle. If it's not on my Kindle,


00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.520
I don't know about it. I love physical books, but I've done so much traveling for work that I just,


00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.280
I'm like, I can't take three books on this trip. I'm just going to put them on my Kindle, you know?


00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.560
So, very cool.


00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.720
And I know he does a lot of training and he said that he wrote this partly as


00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.800
something to give away at his, when he does training.


00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.660
And I think that's kind of a nice thing to hand people


00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.420
if you're gonna do training is something like this.


00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.440
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.560
It's a perfect follow on to a training course


00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.680
or online course or something.


00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.520
Okay, cool.


00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.480
So the next one is by a friend of the show, Anthony Shaw.


00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.560
And title is, "Oh no, this package is only Python 2."


00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.120
Or only supports Python 2.


00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.680
The idea is like, if you're like plowing through a project,


00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.280
doing some Python work and you hit a package


00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.720
that's not supported because it's only Python 2, he wrote up a nice little guide of how


00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.800
to solve that problem and maybe solve it for the world and not just for yourself.


00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.520
He has a 7.5 step guide here.


00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.600
First of all, check that nobody else has solved it.


00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.720
An example of this might be if you go to, say, suds and check out the suds package,


00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.840
which is like a SOAP client for Python, it's only Python 2.


00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.160
It was updated five years ago.


00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.520
You could be like, "Oh no, this doesn't work."


00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.760
Well, there's another one someone else forked and created called suds-jerko.


00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.560
And that one is the Python two and three version.


00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.440
So be sure to look around and like don't go through this effort if someone else is like


00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.960
a non not very popular but solved version.


00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.280
So then he says, Alright, what you can do is you fork it first, like go and see if there's


00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.440
print statements that are statements and not functions.


00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.600
Fix that, right?


00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.240
Write some tests, hopefully tests exist.


00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.840
But if they don't write some tests, because you know, just the fact that it runs isn't


00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.120
really good enough and has some cool package he mentions called modernize.


00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120
Do you know this package, Brian?


00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.840
I haven't used it, but I've heard of it.


00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.360
Yeah, this is not like modernizer from JavaScript.


00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.080
This is something from Python to aid with the conversion.


00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.160
So yeah, it's very cool.


00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.720
I haven't used it much myself either, but I'm going to check it out.


00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.720
So thanks, Anthony, for pointing that one out.


00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.320
It says, all right, update the setup UI to describe your new dependencies and stuff,


00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.200
install into your original project, raise a pull request.


00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.460
And then sadly says, okay, well, what happens when three months later, your pull request


00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.460
is ignored?


00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.600
How do you go about dealing with this?


00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.120
And it turns out as a result of this article, the package that he he wrote this article,


00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.480
because this happened to him, he's like, Alright, I need this package.


00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.840
And oh, no, it's not supported on Python three.


00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.240
So he went through this and actually did the PR and said, after he wrote this article,


00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.960
the author or maintainer of that package came along and quickly accepted the PR.


00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.720
And now that thing is Python three.


00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.100
Okay, so does he have any recommendations for what happens if nothing happens?


00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.620
If nothing happens, he says, after a while, you know, you probably should do what the


00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.260
guy the Jerko guy, that's his first name, Jerko did with suds is go and modify the setup


00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.620
py, create a different package name, and just submit it to pypi as like an alternate version


00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.700
or something if no one's gonna fix the old one, and you can't get control over it.


00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.700
Yeah, interesting.


00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.360
- Yeah, it's worth pointing out that the PyPA,


00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.240
the packaging authority group,


00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.360
they actually just, I think we maybe even discussed this


00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.140
on the show earlier in other episodes,


00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.920
is that they came up with a way to deal with this.


00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.600
Like SUDS is five years old.


00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.240
It's not been edited in five years.


00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.700
Like surely that should be replaced


00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.560
by a modern version of it if there is one, right?


00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.400
So that's cool.


00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.760
Yeah, I think we talked about it last time, right?


00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.920
- Yeah, and it should be,


00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.400
and I'm glad they're taking that on


00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.480
because there should be a way to say,


00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.480
hey, I'm willing to be the new maintainer


00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.800
if nobody else wants this.


00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.640
- Absolutely.


00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.240
- Nice article and I like that this was discussed


00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.120
because that happens, I think that happens


00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.120
at least fairly regularly.


00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.040
- Well, and instead of just throwing up your hands,


00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.900
if a few people go through these steps


00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.000
on the popular packages, right,


00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.960
that solves it for the world.


00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.860
It doesn't just, it solves it for the whole community.


00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.960
It doesn't just solve it for your project, so that's great.


00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.840
- Yeah, definitely.


00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.380
And I think that maybe modernize might be a topic


00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.260
for some other week.


00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.220
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.980
- Next we've got another, I guess another book-like thing.


00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.180
It's not really a book, but there's somebody named


00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.180
Andrew Montalenti, why do I try to pronounce names?


00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.540
Anyway, it's a article called "Elements of Python Style"


00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.620
and of course playing on the elements of,


00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.980
is it just elements of style?


00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.900
Anyway, from writing, but anyway, it takes,


00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.060
it's supposed to be more than PEP 8


00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.320
and it's an opinionated little fairly small style guide still.


00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.120
It's not very huge, talking about basically


00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.480
some common good way to style.


00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.000
I just like the format of it.


00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.320
And I think that I was going to take this article,


00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.600
and it's on GitHub.


00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.080
I was going to take it and fork it and try to make something


00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.100
for my own team.


00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.280
Oh, yeah, that's cool.


00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.600
I think these things are great.


00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.280
And certainly having a consistent style


00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.400
helps, like you say, for example, on your team.


00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.480
And if you are, a lot of people listen to the show,


00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.280
they're looking for jobs, getting into programming,


00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.400
getting into Python, like, study this kind of stuff, right?


00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.000
If you show up for like an interview


00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.320
and they ask you to write some code


00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.440
and you write it JavaScript style,


00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.040
or you write it C++ style and you claim to know Python,


00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.360
they're gonna look at you sideways and go,


00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.960
"Hmm, not so sure about that," you know?


00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.800
- Yeah.


00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.200
- So knowing these things is like the first step


00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.640
to fitting in, I guess.


00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.360
- You have one course on Pythonic stuff,


00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.380
so what did you think of all of these recommendations here?


00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.060
I think these were really good.


00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.720
I didn't totally study every single one of them, but looking through it, it looked really


00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.720
good.


00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.020
For example, one of the pieces of guidance I really like says you can choose camel case,


00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:27.540
so capital first letter, capital letters of every word for things that are not quite class-like.


00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.540
If you have a class, PEP 8 says that should be camel case.


00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.120
But you also have other things like, what about named tuples?


00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.120
How should a named tuple be?


00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.080
I mean, it's effectively a class that has no functions, just data.


00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.520
But you know, it seems like that.


00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.920
So guidance like that, like he says, the main benefit of camel case is calling attention


00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.200
to something that's a global noun rather than a local label or a verb.


00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.760
And like, for example, Python uses true, false, and none as camel case, even though they're


00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.760
not classes.


00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.760
So yeah, I think this is great.


00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.400
I enjoyed the article.


00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.160
My next item for you is just a cool bit of trivia.


00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.220
I want to say thank you to Christian Klaus for sending this my way.


00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:13.400
And I found, I was looking through Reddit for things for this episode and came across


00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.800
somebody had posted a tweet of mine, which that's never happened to me before that a


00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.440
tweet has been actually a topic on Reddit.


00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.040
And one of this popularity, it had 537 upvotes and 71 comments on my tweet.


00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.640
Anyway, why was that cool?


00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.640
Why is that interesting?


00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.280
It has nothing to do with me because I just carried the message from Klaus basically.


00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.440
And it says Python 3, which was originally called Python 3000.


00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.440
Right?


00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.880
That's it's actually from PEP 3000 is the original working title that it got.


00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.360
And it was released December 3, 2008.


00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.680
So last Sunday, February 19, it was exactly 3000 days old.


00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680
Oh, cool.


00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.680
Isn't that nice?


00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.440
So we've come a long ways with Python 3.


00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.840
And you know, some people kind of treat it like it's new.


00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.840
It's not new.


00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.840
Definitely not.


00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.840
Definitely not.


00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.080
But I think it's really cool that we just passed the day where Python 3000 is 3000 days


00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080
old.


00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080
Actually, that's worthwhile trivia.


00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080
I like it.


00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080
Yeah, thanks.


00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:17.040
So another thing that I really like is these resources or like sites that bring all these


00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.040
different information together.


00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.240
Because I have people that ask me all the time, "Hey, Michael, I want to get started


00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.560
in programming.


00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.540
What are the steps I should take?" or "I've gotten this far in Python.


00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.540
What should I study next?


00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.840
Should I go into databases?


00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.360
Should I go into data science?


00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360
What else should I do?"


00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.360
Right?


00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.160
A couple guys that are putting together, actually they're putting together some interesting topics


00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:43.760
lately. Bob Bilderbos and Julian Sequeira, I should have you do the names. These are pretty


00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.800
interesting guys that have actually talked to us, sent out feedback to us about the show and other


00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:56.640
things. But they put together a post called, that it's Python resources and it's called Python


00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.080
books, videos, and resources from beginner to pro.


00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.860
We're going to link a Reddit thread that they put up and also the link to their post.


00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.360
But it's actually, it's not huge.


00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.600
That's one of the things I like about it.


00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.240
It's not really big list, but it's one of the things that it definitely has is it has


00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.160
some nice podcasts listed in the other resources.


00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.320
Yeah, of course.


00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320
Of course.


00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.120
It has like a nice getting started section.


00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:26.120
It has a now you've done fundamentals, how do you get better, additional resources, all


00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.120
sorts of stuff.


00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.120
So a lot of different ways, you know, it's got like a Hitchhiker's Guide to Python, Fluent


00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.080
Python, Effective Python, a lot of stuff that I've covered on my podcast, which is really


00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.360
great.


00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.760
Some online courses and thank you, they've included mine in there, which is really cool.


00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.800
But yeah, a bunch of stuff in here that you can check out.


00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.120
Fullstack Python, which of course is excellent.


00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:53.440
Their website is pybit.es, which is fairly clever and fairly similar to the name of our


00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.440
podcast.


00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.880
It is quite similar.


00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.120
It's not the same, but it is quite similar, PyBytes.


00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.000
These guys, at least Bob is in Spain, I think.


00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.360
So the ES makes a lot of sense there.


00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.360
It's very cool.


00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:12.120
All right, my last one is a Python tool that I think a lot of people will find very useful.


00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.680
So it's called Mongo Audit, and it's written in Python, and it has even a nice little GUI


00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.600
to it, which is pretty cool.


00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:24.920
So it describes itself as a CLI, or command line interface tool for auditing MongoDB servers,


00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.080
poor security settings and performing automatic or automated penetration testing.


00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.640
So you can just pip install Mongo audit and then run it against your Mongo servers.


00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.360
All databases, you want them to be secure, right?


00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.960
Like if database is just accessible on the internet with no login, that's bad, right?


00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.360
Yeah, especially if you have private stuff.


00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.720
So I love MongoDB.


00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.440
I'm on the MongoDB masters group.


00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.800
And I've worked with MongoDB for a long, long time.


00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.200
There's a couple of choices that MongoDB has made in the early days that have kind of harmed


00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.800
it in terms of getting it in the headlines in ways in which it shouldn't be.


00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.320
And a couple of those are by default runs without authentication.


00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.080
Of course, you can set a username and password.


00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.600
But if you don't take that action, because you don't know better, well, then, if it's


00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.660
listening on the open internet, that's really, really bad.


00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.320
And so there's a number of things like make sure you run with SSL enabled, make sure you


00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.560
run with the authentication, and so on and so on.


00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.800
So this tool basically go and run all those tests against a set of MongoDB servers, right?


00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.280
And it checks that it's running like, say, on a non-default port.


00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.880
It only accepts connections from certain hosts and so on.


00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.500
So this is really, really cool.


00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.500
This is very cool.


00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.520
And I'm putting together a tutorial with using Mongo and I'm not, haven't taken any classes


00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.860
in it and I don't know how to do any of this stuff.


00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.680
So I'm glad that there's a tool like this that can point out what problems I've had


00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.920
with my setup and maybe I can pick your brains as to what I should do next.


00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.


00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.120
I would say like at a minimum, you know, run this tool and it has a lot of great recommendations.


00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.160
But certainly at a minimum, if you're, you know, make sure you're at least only listening


00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160
on local loopback.


00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.840
So 127.0.0.1 or you have SSL enabled and authentication enabled, right?


00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.680
Like those are the two big ones, but this tool will catch like that and lots and lots


00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.680
more.


00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.440
If you're somehow in charge of MongoDB things,


00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.360
pip install mongo audit and have a run at it.


00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.960
Very cool.


00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.880
Yeah, very cool. All right, that's it for the news this week.


00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.960
Brian, anything else you want to share with everyone?


00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.240
How's the book coming along?


00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.960
You know, it's very exciting.


00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.160
I think we're going to do a total of,


00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.280
I can't remember, seven or eight chapters and I've got


00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.040
five that I've already gone through second phase editing,


00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.120
and we're playing with book titles and playing with covers now.


00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.320
So hopefully not too much longer


00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.200
before we can make an announcement.


00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.720
- How awesome, and who's the publisher?


00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.540
- Pragmatic.


00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.520
- Pragmatic, awesome.


00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.400
Do they do things like have special covers?


00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.480
Do they have like characters in the covers or anything?


00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.520
- There are different pictures of course for every book,


00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.480
but we're working with, I'm trying to convince them


00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.320
to not do another snake cover just because it's Python.


00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.960
- Absolutely, no more snakes.


00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.800
We can do more.


00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.900
It's not even as, what's so funny is like,


00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.800
it's not even a snake as the origin, right?


00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.640
It's Monty Python.


00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.880
- I was thinking maybe a large tree,


00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.420
but that might not go over well.


00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.620
- What about the rabbit, you know,


00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.880
the rabbit with the grenades?


00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.700
- Oh yeah, that'd be fun.


00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.540
- The killer rabbit.


00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.380
- Killer rabbit.


00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.980
Maybe it won't sell too many tech books.


00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.240
I think it'd be funny.


00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.340
Well, you have some news, Michael.


00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.440
- I do, just this morning I released my latest course


00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.440
at bit.ly, so bit.ly/python-rest-course.


00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.460
So I created a course that is consuming HTTP


00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.220
in RESTful services, JSON, XML, SOAP,


00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.620
binary data, screen scraping, all that kind of stuff.


00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.580
So if that's interesting to you, check out this course.


00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.940
And the next one I'm working on is the anti-matter


00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.700
version of this course, creating services


00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.180
so that other people can consume them.


00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.180
- Oh, nice. - Yeah.


00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.420
So I'm kind of on a services trip these last few weeks.


00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.660
- Cool. - Yeah, yeah.


00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.220
All right, well, thanks for getting together today, Brian,


00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.060
and talking about all this stuff.


00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.400
- Yeah, thank you. - Very interesting stuff.


00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.220
I love all the books and the references and the guidance.


00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.220
>> Yeah.


00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.220
>> All right.


00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.220
Catch you later.


00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.220
Bye, everyone.


00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.220
