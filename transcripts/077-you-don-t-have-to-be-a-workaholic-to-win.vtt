00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is episode 77 recorded May 12th, 2018.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I'm Brian Atkin.


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And we have a very special episode and a live audience.


00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
[applause]


00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That's right, we're recording live from PyCon. Thank you everyone for being here.


00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And everyone who couldn't make it, you missed a great party.


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This episode is brought to you by Datadog.


00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They actually, I think they have, do they have a booth out there?


00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Yeah.


00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.840
booth out there. I've been stuck at my booth the whole time which is wonderful but I don't


00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.520
know what's out there. So that's amazing. We'll tell you more about them later. Right


00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.840
now, Brian, what do you got for us?


00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.200
I have a fun article that actually comes from the Java world but it's "Why Senior Devs Write


00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.200
Dumb Code." And it starts out with a quote from Kent Beck which I love, "Is any fool


00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.440
can write code that a computer can understand? Good programmers write code that humans can


00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.600
understand. And just some tips to make sure that you try to keep clean,


00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.560
clean, straightforward, obvious code and follow principles like YAGNI, single


00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.320
responsibility, DRY, etc. And this, I think this is important in the Python world


00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.360
because there are some cool language features that we have that are fun to


00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.720
play with. And I definitely want people to go ahead and try all the cool new


00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.280
language features but make sure that your code still is readable even by


00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.200
people that aren't as Python savvy as you are. So that's just what I've got.


00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.240
It's awesome. Are you telling me that like the shortest code is not the most readable


00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.680
always? Yes. That's hard for me to do also because I really like one-liners


00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.560
that pack in like a whole bunch of stuff. Yeah I do too. So does that cover the


00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.120
solid principles like single responsibility, open-closed principle or


00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.100
Or is it just more general, like write good code?


00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.760
- Well, I think, may write readable code.


00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.600
- Readable code, right.


00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.880
- I don't necessarily adhere to solid being readable.


00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.080
- You know, that's a really good point.


00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.960
So like solid principles, I don't know if you all know,


00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.320
it's single responsibility principle,


00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.200
open close principle,


00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.300
list cost substitution principle, et cetera.


00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.880
And a lot of times that is like super design pattern heavy


00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.840
and you're like, there's so much abstraction here.


00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.700
Like, I know this looks like it came out of a textbook,


00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.920
but it's bad, right?


00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.760
- Yeah.


00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.600
- Yeah, so actually maybe not so much.


00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.560
- Well, and I've seen it in code reviews too.


00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.560
We've had people do maybe a C-ism in Python,


00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.120
and sometimes that's bad, but also sometimes


00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.600
if it's a little bit of code and you can look at it,


00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.520
it's easy, obvious what it's doing,


00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.000
maybe it doesn't need to change to be more Pythonic.


00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.840
It's probably fine.


00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.240
- Yeah, that's true.


00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.320
So, Brian, have you been having a hard time


00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.520
finding your way around here?


00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.080
You get lost?


00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.960
You guys having a bit of a hard time?


00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.220
I feel like I've taken a walk where it's like, OK, we've


00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.760
gone a quarter mile, and there was a door to that place


00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.320
on the other side of the expo hall.


00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.920
Why did I go that way, right?


00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.880
Well, the next thing, if they had used it--


00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.640
I'm sure they haven't-- if they'd used it,


00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.840
there's this thing called GeoAlchemy2.


00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.960
You've heard of SQLAlchemy, right?


00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.040
So there's this thing you can layer upon SQLAlchemy


00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.200
called GeoAlchemy2.


00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.860
And what it does is it provides geospatial queries and


00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.720
operations on top of, say, Postgres.


00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.000
So you can ask questions like, how far is it


00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.640
from here to there?


00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.480
Like, am I within this room?


00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.760
Like, you could easily define all these as polygons, insert


00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.120
them as SQLAlchemy objects, and ask questions like, who is


00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.000
in such and such room if we all say RFID?


00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.680
And that would be easier to navigate, PyCon?


00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.200
If we could throw some A* algorithms to, like, say, find


00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.400
the shortest path through all the open doors and stuff.


00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.440
Yeah, it'd be easier.


00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.600
Anyone out there do any geospatial queries,


00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.240
things like that?


00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.280
Yeah?


00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.640
Yeah, not that query so much, but we do some geospatial work.


00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.600
And so sometimes you need it.


00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.720
Give it an object, find it in the earth.


00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.520
Nice, have you tried geoalchemy?


00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.120
No, I haven't.


00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.200
Actually, I wanted to ask.


00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.240
Is that from the same people who bring people up?


00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.000
I think it's a different group.


00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
There was a thing called geoalchemy.


00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.240
And then you could use that.


00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.640
And this is like a reimagining of the API.


00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.240
So this is like a second edition.


00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.240
So the way it works is basically just like SQLAlchemy,


00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.960
you connect your database, you declare mapping,


00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.840
you declare the class that just arrives from a SQLAlchemy


00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.760
base.


00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.240
It has a name and an ID.


00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.440
But it can also have columns like a geometry,


00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.040
which is a polygon.


00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.800
And then about that, you can ask questions.


00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.440
Like you can go to it and just say session.query.filter,


00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.560
where this thing contains this point or where the area is greater than or less than such


00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.600
and such. And just all sorts of interesting questions. So if you like SQLAlchemy and you


00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.680
want to ask questions about physical stuff, boom, GeoAlchemy 2.


00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.280
>> Nice. >> Yeah.


00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.920
>> Well, since we didn't share each other, we have no cool segue between everything.


00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.400
>> Not too much, but I got some--I can see what you got here for this one.


00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.600
>> Yeah. >> Yeah, so we've been on a rant, haven't


00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.380
A UI rant?


00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.440
- Yes, a little bit of UI in the podcast.


00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.580
(laughter)


00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.540
But one of the things that has come to our attention


00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.620
is Qt is not staying still.


00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.620
So there's, what I'm talking about here


00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.380
is there's another PySide 2,


00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.820
which is going to be called like--


00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.340
- Qt for Python?


00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.740
- Qt for Python.


00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.900
But it's not quite ready yet.


00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.100
But there's actually a lot of Python bindings


00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.140
that I know of.


00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.660
There's PySide 2, there's PyQt 5, there's PyQt 4,


00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.260
there's the original PySide, and there's a couple,


00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.740
and then there's Qt.py.


00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.540
- And this is just for Qt, not WXPython,


00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.380
not all the other stuff, right?


00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.580
- Yeah, just for Qt.


00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.420
- Yeah.


00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:08.780
- There's two projects, Qt.py.convert is a project


00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.040
that converts these interface bindings to an intermediate,


00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.420
which is a shim layer, which is qt.py,


00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.100
which is a minimal, the build is a minimal Python 2


00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.040
and 3 shim around all of the Qt bindings.


00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.040
And just sort of fun to be able to use one,


00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.140
whatever you've got now, and convert it back and forth.


00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.100
- I think it's a great idea.


00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.940
So it's gonna be awesome that there are new,


00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.900
better ways to write Python UIs.


00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.020
But there's all this other code that people have written,


00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.900
PyQt 4, for example.


00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.140
And this thing will let you sort of run a converter across it


00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.740
to adapt from all these different older versions


00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.820
to the new hotness.


00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.100
So it should make it work really well.


00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.940
Yeah, and one of the neat things about this


00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.220
is it uses a conversion that leaves


00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.980
all your comments in place.


00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.500
So it rewrites Python code, but it rewrites it,


00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.100
leaves a bunch of your stuff in there.


00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.020
That's pretty advanced.


00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.020
>> Yeah, so maybe, but do you like a branch or something before you do that?


00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.020
>> Yeah, probably.


00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.020
>> All right, anybody got a comment on Python UIs?


00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:22.700
All right, cool. So I'm really excited for that. I'm excited for Python for QT coming.


00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.140
I think that's going to be good. There's a bunch of other stuff. I think there's--there


00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.420
needs to be more work done there as I've said. All right, so let me tell all the listeners


00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.700
and you guys about our sponsor.


00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.340
So Datadog, who are big supporters of the Python space,


00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.020
they're here at the conference.


00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.220
Obviously, they've been supporting the show


00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.060
for a long time.


00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.900
So check out Datadog.


00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.420
They're like a monitoring solution


00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.580
mostly for your distributed applications.


00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.900
So if you got like microservices and containers


00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.000
and all that, you can trace a request


00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.420
from one part to the next and the next


00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.740
and figure out where things are slow,


00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.100
where you run into errors, all sorts of stuff like that.


00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.460
So get a cool Datadog t-shirt.


00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.340
Go to pythonbytes.fm/datadog.


00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.420
Do the tutorial, get a cute dog shirt.


00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.120
- That's awesome.


00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.700
All right, so, Brian, we live in a pretty laid back city,


00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.340
Portland, it's pretty chill, right?


00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.180
- Love it.


00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.860
- Yeah, I love it too, man.


00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.740
But even in Portland, there is a bit of a sense


00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.440
of people are like working really hard


00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.940
and it's almost like a badge of honor.


00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.940
Like, oh man, how you doing?


00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.180
I'm so busy, you wouldn't believe how busy I am.


00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.260
I know you're busy, but I'm like way more busy.


00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.220
I've got all these projects


00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.540
and I've got this stuff going on and that.


00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.600
There's this great article written that is a reminder


00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.960
that you don't have to be a workaholic to get ahead in tech.


00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.200
So the article's called, "You Don't Have to Be a Workaholic


00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.240
to Win 13 Alternative Ways to Stand Out."


00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.960
And I really, really like this because I feel like


00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.880
there's two things going on that I don't like.


00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.020
One is this, what I kind of opened with,


00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.840
people like busy brag, like it's cool to them


00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.480
to be super busy.


00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.240
And so they just tell you how busy they are


00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.860
and you know, you just one up each other.


00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.320
- Yeah, I ran into this guy that says like,


00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.320
yeah, I've got two podcasts, I wrote a book.


00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:56.820
Yeah.


00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.280
[LAUGHTER]


00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.160
That's not cool, man.


00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.840
That's not cool.


00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.280
And the other one is actual tech companies or other companies


00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.680
that are like, you know what?


00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.800
We're going to put just a fake deadline here, six weeks out,


00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.000
and make everybody work overtime so we can hit it.


00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.480
And they're just like, well, what happens if we don't hit


00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.240
it?


00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.760
Well, then my manager will be upset.


00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.080
That's not a real deadline, right?


00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.800
Those are not actual deadlines.


00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.960
And so there's just a bunch of great ideas in here.


00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.960
So let me run by you and see what you think.


00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.240
Oh, by the way, yeah, let me just run through the tips.


00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.080
Hold on.


00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.080
This thing like popped up, Anthony.


00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.760
All right, so here's the tips.


00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.800
The first one is like you can be a workaholic


00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.860
or you can be creative.


00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.560
And if you really try to think differently about solutions,


00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.400
if you're the person that says,


00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.640
yeah, we could work all night


00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.440
and we could build this thing this way,


00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.760
well, did you know you can pip install a thing


00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.580
that did this, right?


00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.960
If you just like think outside of the box


00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.040
and try to solve the solution,


00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.520
creativity could be more value than working hard.


00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.360
Yeah? - Yeah.


00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.960
- Stubbornness.


00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.060
Stubbornness is not generally considered a good thing,


00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.720
but in programming, I've had lots of people go,


00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.240
"Michael, you're so good with computers,


00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.880
"you're such a good programmer, how'd you learn this?"


00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.520
It's like, I tried this, it was hard, it didn't work.


00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.300
I'm just like, well, I tried it for three hours,


00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.440
and then it did work, right?


00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.960
I tried everything I could think of until it worked,


00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.720
and it just, I wasn't gonna quit.


00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.440
And I think that's one of the things they're talking about.


00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.560
You have that experience?


00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.400
- So that's a way to work less?


00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.520
- No, that's not a way to work less.


00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.320
But what they're saying is if you're the person


00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.880
that can actually solve the problem


00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.340
'cause you don't give up on it,


00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.240
rather than just like, ah, we can't do this thing,


00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.080
we gotta do something else.


00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.920
- Okay.


00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.740
- You know, that kind of thing.


00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.360
They're all like a pretty interesting little takes.


00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.880
Curiosity.


00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.720
- Yeah.


00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.680
- Right, like I'm willing to be the person


00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.080
that learns Kubernetes and actually now we can all go home


00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.280
'cause our deployments don't break


00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.960
and I don't even have a pager, it's amazing.


00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.920
Right, that's cool.


00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.360
Kindness, I really like the kindness one.


00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.920
Like if everyone is a jerk, and you're the person that's nice


00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.720
and helps everyone, right?


00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.640
Like all of a sudden, you become the person, the officer,


00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.140
the company.


00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.800
And they're like, yeah.


00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.760
Go talk to Jeff, man.


00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.200
He will help you, and he won't insult you at the same time.


00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.960
Planning.


00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.360
Planning is good.


00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.120
Improvisation.


00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.400
Like sort of the opposite of planning.


00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.280
Like, well, things aren't going according to plan.


00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.880
Let's fix it.


00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.080
Enthusiasm.


00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.160
Kind of like kindness.


00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.680
Communication.


00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.480
That's good.


00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.160
Presence.


00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.280
I really like that one.


00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.080
Yes.


00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.320
Right?


00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.400
Like so many people are like, yeah, that's a great idea.


00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.840
Yeah, I'm gonna go work on my thing, right?


00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.840
But just like take the time to like be in the moment.


00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.840
- That's actually hard.


00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.800
- It's hard, I'm making fun of it, but it's hard.


00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.160
- And especially in a work environment,


00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.200
you're like in the middle of something,


00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.320
somebody comes over.


00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.520
If you're gonna be interrupted anyway,


00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.760
then really be interrupted and pay attention.


00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.760
- Yeah, exactly.


00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.920
Yeah, yeah, for sure.


00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.880
So I'll keep going, just a little bit more collaboration,


00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.400
right, open source, like we're all kind of in that space.


00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.960
Anyway, willingness, I honestly forget what that is about.


00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.560
But I remember it was really good.


00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.480
Patience also.


00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.520
And then finally, institutional knowledge.


00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.320
Like--


00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.320
Where to lock people up.


00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.840
Yeah, where the bodies are buried.


00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.680
No, like why do we have that old server over there?


00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.360
And can anybody work with it?


00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.400
Yeah, actually, I know where the source code is,


00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.880
and I could fix that for you, right?


00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.600
I don't want to.


00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.960
It's PHP, but I could fix it if I had to.


00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.000
Anyway, so do these resonate with you guys?


00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.840
- Yeah.


00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.500
- You think of Stephanie, I'm forgetting her last name.


00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.340
- Herbert.


00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.420
- Yeah, she talked about,


00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.380
I mean your conversation over there was about mentoring,


00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.820
but she talked about her worker approach


00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.740
and how she only works like four hours a day.


00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.900
She owns her own data compression and consultancy.


00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.100
But this also makes me think of a post I've seen


00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.780
from somebody who works with a Starbucks'


00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.180
web application group today.


00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.900
Talked about how they pretty much almost burned out


00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:52.900
industry and they just, the AI institutes some of these principles to just make things


00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.900
obviously probably not only more productive at work, just more sustainable for you long


00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.900
term on a personal basis.


00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.900
Yeah, that's great.


00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.900
Yeah, absolutely.


00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.900
All right.


00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.900
So are we going back to World War I?


00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.900
No, we're actually going back to QT.


00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.900
Oh, okay.


00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.900
So pretty much the trenches.


00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.380
Yeah, so actually, we just related to that.


00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.100
When I was researching for the QTPy convert,


00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.580
I was curious as to how they did the conversion


00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.420
while leaving the code comments in place.


00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.660
So I followed the rabbit hole, and there's


00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.340
a project called Red Baron, which


00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.660
is I hadn't heard of before.


00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:38.460
But it calls itself a FST, which is a full syntax tree.


00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.940
So it's a lossless abstract syntax tree thing,


00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.220
which you can do queries and modifications.


00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:51.220
And I think it's, they've got a few uses that they list


00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.520
of possibly like renaming a variable in a source file


00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.060
and making sure that it doesn't clash with anything


00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.140
that's not a variable, like not clashing with things


00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.340
in strings and other bits.


00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.240
A few handful of like splitting up files.


00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.200
There's other, I think this is sort of maybe a tool


00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.940
to build other tools with.


00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:17.760
I can't imagine, I personally wouldn't try to write


00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.200
a script of doing this, but if I built it into an ID


00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200
or something like that.


00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.360
- Yeah, this sounds like this is the foundation


00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.480
of a refactoring tool.


00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.320
- Yeah.


00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.440
- Pretty much, that's awesome.


00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.720
- But I've done hundreds of tests.


00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.240
There's no off the shelf thing that's gonna do that,


00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.280
but maybe something like this.


00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.000
- Yeah, that's really, really awesome.


00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.320
But it's a fun project.


00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.400
- Michael, you joke about the conversion of two to three,


00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.080
but that's exactly what two to three, the tool does.


00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.400
- Yeah, no, yeah.


00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.120
- So everyone here knows AST module, I hope,


00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.360
it's really cool.


00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.360
And then I guess they call it a full syntax tree,


00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.360
but it's often more broadly referred to as a CST,


00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.920
or concrete syntax tree.


00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.760
- Okay, nice.


00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.640
- And so that's what two to three is based on.


00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.040
It's also what the new black code formatting tool


00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.040
>> Yes. >> It's based on, right?


00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.040
It has to maintain comments and all these things that otherwise


00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.040
go away in the ASD. >> Right. That's awesome.


00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.040
Yeah, thanks. Black is awesome. We covered it before.


00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.040
You got to like the color. All right.


00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.040
So I want to close out the official items with something


00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.040
pretty cool here. So our booth is right next to the


00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.040
B-ware guys. And the B-ware guys are trying to


00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.040
fill another major hole that I see in the Python space, which


00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.720
in the Python space, which is really around packaging and especially mobile, right? Like


00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:41.720
they're trying to build native apps in Python. And I've been a little bit of a -- I've criticized


00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.040
them a little bit previously saying, "You guys, there's like not really many demos and


00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.120
not a lot of screenshots. You got to like show me where this stuff is if you expect


00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.400
people to use it," right? Well, so one of the announcements this week is that Project


00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:58.080
Beware just launched an app in the Apple App Store. Like a straight up approved by Apple,


00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.160
install it on your phone and it does stuff.


00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.120
It's not super advanced, it's basically like,


00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.820
gives you currency conversions and tip calculations,


00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.680
like how much do I need to tip in like RMB,


00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.600
you know, it's things like that,


00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.120
but it's really cool that there's an example


00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.000
of a BeWear app in the App Store.


00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.920
- Yeah.


00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.760
- Yeah.


00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.680
- Is that one from the app store?


00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.720
- I'm sure that it is, I haven't looked at the source code,


00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.080
but yeah, I'm sure that they've got it up there.


00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.800
So the link I have, I think, either goes to an article


00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.680
straight to the App Store and it's pretty cool.


00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.920
So it uses Briefcase and Toga and Briefcase is a tool for converting a Python project


00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.820
into a standalone native app on Mac, Windows, Linux, iPad, iPhone, Android, Apple TV and


00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.820
tvOS.


00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.080
Actually, are those different?


00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.800
Anyway, yeah, Apple TV and tvOS, awesome.


00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.640
So it's pretty cool.


00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.640
So it's like a first step.


00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.960
I was talking to Keith Russell McGee about it and he's pretty excited but it's just the


00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.840
the first step. But if you guys are looking to contribute to open source, they're really


00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:08.000
big at accepting new folks. They're a really great project for that.


00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And you get a token.


00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And you get a cool token, like a token to say I contributed to the BWORK project.


00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.240
Yeah, I was actually talking with Ken Russell.


00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.240
Russell.


00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:24.480
Yeah. And he was, one of the things that I, one of the parts of their system is Cricut,


00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.240
which is a testing GUI.


00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.320
And it doesn't handle pytest, but that's


00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.660
one of the things they'd like to have somebody work on


00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.520
is to try to convert--


00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.280
Oh, are you going to add pytest to Cricut?


00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.240
I'll look into it.


00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.080
But I'm bringing this up now to recruit anybody else that


00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.280
wants to help out with that.


00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.680
Because I would definitely try it out more


00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.040
if it already had a pytest link.


00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.080
Yeah, that's awesome.


00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.160
Yeah, you gave your talk on visual testing with--


00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.000
- Yeah.


00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.500
- PyCharm, which is awesome, and it's gonna be on


00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.260
what's up, I'm gonna mention in a second.


00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.100
But that's sort of another analogous thing, right?


00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.340
Like a GUI for running your tests and your project.


00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.460
- Yeah, so we use PyCharm for the test runner part,


00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.340
but this would be just a stand-alone test runner


00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.340
without an IDE attached to it.


00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.060
- Yeah, exactly, no editing, just the running.


00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:12.900
- Yeah.


00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.900
- Right, it's easier to fix the test


00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.220
if you don't have to edit it.


00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.060
(laughing)


00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.300
All right, well, I think that's it for all of our items


00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.340
that we have for you guys this week.


00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.900
I have a few extra things I wanna throw out.


00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.120
Actually, this one more to the listeners.


00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.420
So first of all, all the videos, except for things like this,


00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.500
are recorded and put online.


00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.020
So already the videos from PyCon 2018 are live,


00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.700
and people can check them out, right?


00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.540
There's some.


00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.900
Yeah, not all of them, but they're coming in.


00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.460
There's a day or two latency there.


00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.060
That's pretty good, though, for video.


00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:47.260
So just go to youtube.com/pycon2018.


00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.880
The other one is not so good.


00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.860
Apparently there was some package that caused some trouble.


00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.100
Like previously, remember we talked about there being bad


00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.980
packages getting into the app store,


00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.860
not app store, the pip, pivo.


00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.700
- Yeah.


00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.520
- PyPI.


00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.900
So there's some Reddit post that says,


00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.300
"Hey guys, you should be a little bit careful


00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.660
"with the ssh-decorator package."


00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.020
And it says, "Don't install it or use it from pip.


00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.220
"It has a backdoor to steal all your SSH credentials."


00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.060
- Oh.


00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.460
- And if that's true, you should not have this running


00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.680
anymore and you should uninstall it.


00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:26.000
I don't know, but the people say the compromise package has been taken out.


00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.920
They reached out to the developers and initially there was no response, but apparently it's


00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.160
gone now.


00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.700
So you can't update it, but if you already have it, you should not have it anymore.


00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.200
So just like a sort of PSA, public service announcement, don't use that.


00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200
>> Yeah.


00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200
>> Yeah.


00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.200
So anything else you want to add, Brian?


00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.200
>> No, I'm just having a great time at PyCon.


00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.000
>> Yeah, PyCon is awesome.


00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.920
I call this my geek holiday.


00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.920
I try to refrain telling my wife that because she's like, "You just got back from geek


00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.920
holiday."


00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.920
I'm like, "No, I'm really actually tired.


00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.920
I need to rest."


00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.920
"No, you need to take the kids and do this and do that."


00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.920
It's all right.


00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.480
But yeah, I really love coming here and I really look forward to meeting everybody and


00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.200
having these experiences.


00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.200
It's exhausting.


00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200
It's exhausting in an amazing way.


00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.920
You've got to talk with nerd stuff all day long and then go out and have dinner and drinks


00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.920
with nerds all day long.


00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920
I know.


00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.920
I had to have cocktails yesterday.


00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.920
It was really hard.


00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.180
(laughter)


00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.460
Alright, so how about everyone in the audience,


00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.000
you guys wanna just close it out,


00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.940
say goodbye from PyCon?


00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.820
- Goodbye from PyCon!


00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.860
- Thank you everyone for listening,


00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.500
