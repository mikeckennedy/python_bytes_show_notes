00:00:00 <v Brian Okken>Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05 <v Brian Okken>This is episode 457, and it's being recorded on November 11th, 2025.

00:00:11 <v Brian Okken>And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:12 <v Michael Kennedy>And I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:14 <v Brian Okken>Wow, nowhere. Oh, it's 11-11. It's corduroy day. I totally forgot to wear corduroy today.

00:00:20 <v Michael Kennedy>I love it. Is that because the vertical stripes?

00:00:22 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, yeah.

00:00:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Vertical grooves.

00:00:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, yeah. I love it. I have no corduroy on either. We missed the opportunity.

00:00:28 <v Brian Okken>some stripes on your, it's not corduroy, but your sweater.

00:00:32 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, almost a sweater, almost pulled it off.

00:00:34 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, we'd like to thank everybody that supports us through going to

00:00:40 <v Brian Okken>doing Talk Python training or the pytest course, <v Brian Okken>Patreon supporters or people that have bought our books.

00:00:47 <v Brian Okken>We really, really appreciate all of the support and it keeps us going.

00:00:51 <v Brian Okken>Also love to hear from people on Bluesky, on Mastodon and through email.

00:00:57 <v Brian Okken>So you can go to the contact us on pythonbytes.fm.

00:01:02 <v Brian Okken>And there's the links to all the Bluesky Mastermind, <v Brian Okken>all those things to get all of us.

00:01:07 <v Brian Okken>We actually have a couple items today from listeners.

00:01:10 <v Brian Okken>So feel free to send us things.

00:01:13 <v Brian Okken>If you'd like to join the show live, <v Brian Okken>and even if it's on a weird time like this week,

00:01:19 <v Brian Okken>you can find out when it's going to happen next <v Brian Okken>by going to pythonbytes.fm/live.

00:01:24 <v Brian Okken>And, you know, jump on and talk with us while we're recording.

00:01:28 <v Brian Okken>It's fun.

00:01:29 <v Brian Okken>Also, you don't need to take notes because we're going to send you all the links.

00:01:34 <v Brian Okken>Well, they're in the show notes, but we'll also send them directly to your inbox if you

00:01:38 <v Brian Okken>sign up to be a friend of the show and go to pythonbytes.fm and sign up for the newsletter.

00:01:45 <v Brian Okken>I think that's all of the stuff.

00:01:47 <v Brian Okken>So let's jump into the first item, Michael.

00:01:50 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's talk about it now.

00:01:52 <v Michael Kennedy>I want to talk about something called HTTP tap at HTTP tap.dev. Now this one, it's a little bit

00:02:01 <v Michael Kennedy>like HTTP pi, HTTP pi, I don't know how you really pronounce that correctly, which is my go to

00:02:08 <v Michael Kennedy>anytime I need to test something on the terminal or that sort of thing. HTTP pi is because, you know,

00:02:15 <v Michael Kennedy>it's like curl or whatever, but it gives you lots more stats, gives you more information. And this,

00:02:20 <v Michael Kennedy>This is a little bit like that.

00:02:21 <v Michael Kennedy>If you wanted to go into, say, your Chrome DevTools or something

00:02:25 <v Michael Kennedy>and say, "Hey, I'm requesting this page or this URL <v Michael Kennedy>or this API endpoint.

00:02:30 <v Michael Kennedy>It's a little bit slow.

00:02:31 <v Michael Kennedy>It's a little bit funky.

00:02:32 <v Michael Kennedy>What's going on?

00:02:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Where's the problem?" <v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah. - If it's getting hung up,

00:02:35 <v Michael Kennedy>is it connecting to the server <v Michael Kennedy>or is it the backend app server, like Grinny

00:02:41 <v Michael Kennedy>and whoever is not responding?

00:02:42 <v Michael Kennedy>So that's what this is all about.

00:02:45 <v Michael Kennedy>And it's built, I believe it's built with rich or textual.

00:02:48 <v Michael Kennedy>I can't remember how far down the Will McGugan train it goes,

00:02:52 <v Michael Kennedy>but it definitely is built on some of those.

00:02:54 <v Michael Kennedy>Built with Python, <v Michael Kennedy>although that's not necessarily that important, right?

00:02:58 <v Michael Kennedy>It's just I guess it's easier to make improvements to,

00:03:00 <v Michael Kennedy>but it's more just a tool that anyone doing web stuff

00:03:03 <v Michael Kennedy>with Python might be interested in.

00:03:06 <v Michael Kennedy>And I pulled up a little example of just asking Talk Python,

00:03:10 <v Michael Kennedy>acptptap, then talkpython.fm, <v Michael Kennedy>and it says, here's the analysis.

00:03:13 <v Michael Kennedy>And apparently there's only one step, <v Michael Kennedy>maybe if there were redirects or something,

00:03:16 <v Michael Kennedy>It would show multi-stage flows, but there's no redirects, so there's not.

00:03:22 <v Michael Kennedy>It shows you the IP address, the TLS version, the cipher,

00:03:25 <v Michael Kennedy>when the certificate expires, the status, the size, the server.

00:03:30 <v Michael Kennedy>It gets all of that stuff right, which is pretty cool.

00:03:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Then it has this waterfall-tiered sort of diagram.

00:03:36 <v Michael Kennedy>It says the request timeline.

00:03:38 <v Michael Kennedy>It took 29 milliseconds for DNS to figure out where the heck that was.

00:03:42 <v Michael Kennedy>I've been on vacation. I haven't been going to the website.

00:03:45 <v Michael Kennedy>So I had to go get it from the internet.

00:03:47 <v Michael Kennedy>And then it took 80 milliseconds to connect to the server.

00:03:50 <v Michael Kennedy>By the way, it's about 80 milliseconds ping time.

00:03:53 <v Michael Kennedy>So you got to keep that in mind when all these numbers, right?

00:03:55 <v Michael Kennedy>Like that's East Coast, West Coast, US, 2,500 miles.

00:03:59 <v Michael Kennedy>So connect 80 milliseconds.

00:04:02 <v Michael Kennedy>TLS took 130 milliseconds.

00:04:05 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you ever see your browser doing like keep alive type of stuff,

00:04:09 <v Michael Kennedy>that's a big savings right there.

00:04:10 <v Michael Kennedy>That's almost 200 milliseconds savings <v Michael Kennedy>if it doesn't have to keep doing that over and over, right?

00:04:15 <v Michael Kennedy>So that's pretty nice.

00:04:15 <v Michael Kennedy>And then you can see it's actually sending the request and waiting for the response.

00:04:21 <v Michael Kennedy>So it goes out, comes back, takes 170 milliseconds.

00:04:25 <v Michael Kennedy>Again, ping time in there as well.

00:04:27 <v Michael Kennedy>And then the transfer is a whopping 4.3 milliseconds.

00:04:31 <v Michael Kennedy>So this is pretty cool.

00:04:32 <v Michael Kennedy>A really quick view of just seeing what's going on, right, Brian?

00:04:34 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, actually, I love that.

00:04:37 <v Brian Okken>Very useful, especially if you've got some lag issues or some part of your website that's a little slow.

00:04:44 <v Brian Okken>you can look at what's going on.

00:04:46 <v Brian Okken>Is it DNS?

00:04:48 <v Brian Okken>Is it the transfer?

00:04:50 <v Brian Okken>Where's this delay coming from?

00:04:51 <v Brian Okken>I mean, it's not super fine-grained, <v Brian Okken>but this is pretty good.

00:04:54 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, well, there's just, yeah, for sure.

00:04:56 <v Michael Kennedy>And there's a lot of stuff involved, right?

00:04:57 <v Michael Kennedy>There's, like you said, <v Michael Kennedy>the DNS might be taking forever,

00:05:00 <v Michael Kennedy>which could be part of the problem, <v Michael Kennedy>or who knows, right?

00:05:02 <v Michael Kennedy>There's just a lot of things.

00:05:04 <v Michael Kennedy>So really neat to see this little UI built in Python.

00:05:09 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, and I guess we have to say it.

00:05:12 <v Brian Okken>It's always DNS.

00:05:13 <v Brian Okken>It's always DNS.

00:05:14 <v Brian Okken>I mean, that's...

00:05:16 <v Brian Okken>It's not always DNS, but yeah.

00:05:18 <v Brian Okken>Anyway.

00:05:19 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, but often.

00:05:20 <v Brian Okken>Often.

00:05:21 <v Brian Okken>No, I think this is great.

00:05:23 <v Brian Okken>This is cool.

00:05:24 <v Brian Okken>I've got actually some side projects <v Brian Okken>that I've got some weird speed issues,

00:05:30 <v Brian Okken>and I don't know why.

00:05:31 <v Brian Okken>And even just looking at some of this stuff, <v Brian Okken>help out to figure out where to start debugging.

00:05:36 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, you can get some of these types of things <v Michael Kennedy>in the dev tools and browsers,

00:05:41 <v Michael Kennedy>but this is really nice.

00:05:42 <v Michael Kennedy>It's visual, it's colorful, it's graphical.

00:05:44 <v Brian Okken>I love it.

00:05:44 <v Brian Okken>I like it.

00:05:44 <v Brian Okken>And it's command line.

00:05:46 <v Brian Okken>Yay, we love command line.

00:05:47 <v Brian Okken>Yay.

00:05:48 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:05:50 <v Brian Okken>I'm not usually, I have to admit, I click on listicles all the time.

00:05:55 <v Brian Okken>But we don't cover very many listicles on the show, but I'm going to cover one today.

00:06:01 <v Brian Okken>I actually, oh, my aspect ratio is off.

00:06:04 <v Brian Okken>There we go.

00:06:05 <v Brian Okken>Here we go.

00:06:07 <v Brian Okken>This is from PyCharm.

00:06:08 <v Brian Okken>It's actually from Evgenia Verbena.

00:06:12 <v Brian Okken>That's a cool name.

00:06:13 <v Brian Okken>10 smart performance hacks for faster Python code.

00:06:19 <v Brian Okken>And there's some that, well, actually, I think stuff like this is really good to talk to people about

00:06:26 <v Brian Okken>because we don't really think about performance too much.

00:06:28 <v Brian Okken>I mean, when you're starting Python, you don't think about it too much.

00:06:32 <v Brian Okken>It's hopefully, you know, hopefully you don't.

00:06:34 <v Brian Okken>There's, we don't want people to prematurely optimize.

00:06:37 <v Brian Okken>But there's just some habits that maybe are decent to get into that avoid problems later on.

00:06:44 <v Brian Okken>And so that's one of the reasons why I like going through this.

00:06:48 <v Brian Okken>Oh, nice menu on the right side, also with all the hacks on the right.

00:06:53 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, the first one, not too surprising if you've done through any leak code stuff or whatever,

00:07:00 <v Brian Okken>is leverage set for membership testing.

00:07:04 <v Brian Okken>So if you've got a big list, you can throw the list into a set,

00:07:08 <v Brian Okken>and then you can find out easily if something's in the list by putting it in a set.

00:07:14 <v Brian Okken>And oddly, that speeds things up quite a bit, like drastically.

00:07:20 <v Brian Okken>List lookup versus set lookup is super fast.

00:07:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Same predictionaries, too.

00:07:26 <v Michael Kennedy>If you're looking up by some kind of key, either one, it's ridiculous.

00:07:30 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:07:32 <v Brian Okken>Like I said, some not too surprising.

00:07:34 <v Brian Okken>Slots are great if you're going to use classes or data classes even.

00:07:39 <v Brian Okken>If it's not going to grow over time, you can define slots and stuff.

00:07:44 <v Brian Okken>And then the lookup for each element within a data class is a lot faster with slots.

00:07:52 <v Brian Okken>I want to jump around because there were some that I didn't really realize

00:07:56 <v Brian Okken>or I just didn't think about before.

00:07:59 <v Brian Okken>And one of them is use math functions instead of operators.

00:08:01 <v Brian Okken>and I guess I wouldn't <v Brian Okken>some of these are weird

00:08:06 <v Brian Okken>so math.square <v Brian Okken>sqrt for square root <v Brian Okken>is faster and more accurate

00:08:12 <v Brian Okken>than raising a number to the power of <v Brian Okken>0.5 using

00:08:16 <v Brian Okken>exponentation operator <v Brian Okken>I wouldn't do that anyway because that's weird

00:08:20 <v Brian Okken>it just looks weird <v Brian Okken>I don't know, bad code style

00:08:24 <v Brian Okken>but there's a whole bunch of others <v Brian Okken>similarly the sine function exponent

00:08:28 <v Brian Okken>log, those are really fast operators <v Brian Okken>in math so go ahead and utilize math and uh so that's a good pointer pre-allocate memory

00:08:36 <v Brian Okken>with known sizes now this is some like an old trick that i think that i didn't really think

00:08:41 <v Brian Okken>that it was a huge difference and it looks like one of the things that's it's cool in this article

00:08:45 <v Brian Okken>it does the pre-allocated time versus or the uh before and after times so there's a bit of

00:08:51 <v Brian Okken>you know uh 0.01 second speed up um but so the trick is just to uh i guess have an array with

00:08:59 <v Brian Okken>If you're going to fill an array anyway, <v Brian Okken>may as well just fill it with some zeros or something initially.

00:09:05 <v Brian Okken>And then it seems like a waste of time to fill it with zeros

00:09:09 <v Brian Okken>because you're going to fill everything up.

00:09:11 <v Brian Okken>But it isn't because it's the allocation that takes a little bit longer

00:09:14 <v Brian Okken>than the filling it with zeros.

00:09:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and Brian, it's worth thinking through how that goes a little bit

00:09:20 <v Michael Kennedy>because if you just go append, append, append, <v Michael Kennedy>and this is something I don't do and it's inspiring me to consider,

00:09:25 <v Michael Kennedy>well, maybe I should.

00:09:26 <v Michael Kennedy>But the array doesn't know if you're going to put a million items in there.

00:09:30 <v Michael Kennedy>Every time you do like a array.append or list.append, it doesn't go, guess what?

00:09:35 <v Michael Kennedy>We're going to add a million, right?

00:09:35 <v Michael Kennedy>It's like, well, what about 16?

00:09:37 <v Michael Kennedy>What about 32 of them?

00:09:39 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, now we need more.

00:09:40 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay, what about 64 of them?

00:09:41 <v Michael Kennedy>You know, it just, it has to keep reallocating and copying as you build this up.

00:09:45 <v Michael Kennedy>So, yeah.

00:09:46 <v Brian Okken>And I don't remember how, I mean, it's a little smarter than that.

00:09:49 <v Brian Okken>So I think it like does, like doubles it in size or takes a chunk.

00:09:53 <v Brian Okken>I can't remember what it does.

00:09:54 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it's not allocating every one, right?

00:09:56 <v Michael Kennedy>It's got an awkward.

00:09:56 <v Michael Kennedy>Right.

00:09:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Or heuristic.

00:09:57 <v Brian Okken>But if you already know how big it's going to be, <v Brian Okken>you can just tell it to do it once, which is cool.

00:10:03 <v Brian Okken>But I don't really think about that too much.

00:10:06 <v Brian Okken>A couple of the ones down below I really wanted to cover.

00:10:09 <v Brian Okken>This was avoid exception handling and hot loops.

00:10:13 <v Brian Okken>And I am guilty of this too, <v Brian Okken>because I try to have my exception handling

00:10:17 <v Brian Okken>as close to the place where it can go wrong as possible.

00:10:21 <v Brian Okken>Just as it's a visual thing <v Brian Okken>and a code readability thing to have this tight.

00:10:26 <v Brian Okken>have the try right around it.

00:10:28 <v Brian Okken>Like the example has a zero division error, <v Brian Okken>has the try and accept right there.

00:10:34 <v Brian Okken>However, that might slow down a little bit.

00:10:38 <v Brian Okken>And it did, in this case, <v Brian Okken>was the try and accept on this one.

00:10:42 <v Brian Okken>It's just not there.

00:10:43 <v Michael Kennedy>I think the top one versus the bottom one.

00:10:44 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, but there's no try and accept at the top.

00:10:46 <v Michael Kennedy>That's the baseline.

00:10:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, okay.

00:10:48 <v Michael Kennedy>The conditional check versus.

00:10:51 <v Michael Kennedy>It's like checking for the condition <v Michael Kennedy>that would cause the exception to avoid the exception.

00:10:55 <v Brian Okken>Oh, OK.

00:10:57 <v Brian Okken>I guess I would just put the try and accept at the top <v Brian Okken>or around the larger one as a better comparison.

00:11:03 <v Brian Okken>Anyway.

00:11:04 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I agree.

00:11:05 <v Brian Okken>But this is a big one.

00:11:06 <v Brian Okken>But that's a big one.

00:11:08 <v Brian Okken>Then we get into some really, except there's exception handling,

00:11:13 <v Brian Okken>using iter tools for combinatorial operations.

00:11:16 <v Brian Okken>And this is huge.

00:11:18 <v Brian Okken>If you're working with chunks of lists or chunks of stuff,

00:11:23 <v Brian Okken>using iter tools and knowing what's in there, <v Brian Okken>it speeds up a huge amount.

00:11:29 <v Brian Okken>So using iter tools versus loops for, <v Brian Okken>I forget what the example is here,

00:11:34 <v Brian Okken>but the speed up is using product <v Brian Okken>and the speed up is massive from, you know,

00:11:40 <v Brian Okken>like what, 440 times bigger or something?

00:11:44 <v Brian Okken>Or 4 divided by, oh, 5 divided by 20.

00:11:47 <v Brian Okken>That's 4.

00:11:47 <v Brian Okken>So it's 4 times speed up.

00:11:49 <v Brian Okken>Math is hard.

00:11:51 <v Brian Okken>BISect is also a great thing to look at.

00:11:54 <v Brian Okken>And yeah, anyway, just some cool, wow, that's a massive speedup, 100 times speedup for using

00:12:01 <v Brian Okken>BISect in the right places.

00:12:03 <v Brian Okken>So finding out places where you can use BISect or iter tools and just knowing that those

00:12:08 <v Brian Okken>are there to look them up, those are good speedups.

00:12:10 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, occasionally it's good to think about how fast is my code going?

00:12:14 <v Michael Kennedy>You know, I think we could summarize up that article by basically saying, know the standard

00:12:21 <v Michael Kennedy>know your data structures, mostly.

00:12:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:12:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Use DICT, use Zitter Tools, et cetera.

00:12:27 <v Brian Okken>And the standard library is still pretty big.

00:12:30 <v Brian Okken>I would probably limit that to the standard library <v Brian Okken>that manipulates data structures.

00:12:35 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it kind of intersects with data structures.

00:12:37 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I guess that's kind of what I was getting at.

00:12:39 <v Michael Kennedy>And by the way, this was written by Dito Grigorov <v Michael Kennedy>and posted by Uvigena.

00:12:44 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, okay.

00:12:45 <v Michael Kennedy>Just want to make sure Dito gets a little credit for writing it.

00:12:48 <v Brian Okken>Thanks for that clarification.

00:12:50 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, no worries.

00:12:51 <v Michael Kennedy>- It's tricky, I think it's 'cause the way <v Michael Kennedy>the JetBrains CMS works.

00:12:55 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, so cool, cool.

00:12:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, maybe we should, Brian, <v Michael Kennedy>maybe we should talk to him about it.

00:13:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Put him up on a little video call, you know what I mean?

00:13:03 <v Michael Kennedy>What do you think?

00:13:03 <v Michael Kennedy>Do a little WebRTC?

00:13:05 <v Michael Kennedy>- I've kind of forgot about RTC.

00:13:07 <v Michael Kennedy>- I know, but you and I are sitting here, <v Michael Kennedy>people don't necessarily know how we're doing this.

00:13:12 <v Michael Kennedy>It's magic, we basically, you and I, we speak through magic,

00:13:15 <v Michael Kennedy>but some of that magic is WebRTC <v Michael Kennedy>because all of this is recording, streaming, et cetera,

00:13:23 <v Michael Kennedy>video and voice, multiple channels, multiple screens,

00:13:26 <v Michael Kennedy>and so on over WebRTC in the browser, which is ridiculous.

00:13:30 <v Michael Kennedy>It's just ridiculous that this works.

00:13:33 <v Michael Kennedy>So I want to talk about a library from Freddie Bolton,

00:13:36 <v Michael Kennedy>who is behind the Gradio project, Gradio, Gradio, <v Michael Kennedy>Gradio project, and I had him on Talk Python

00:13:43 <v Michael Kennedy>a couple of years ago, and this is called FastRTC.

00:13:46 <v Michael Kennedy>So kind of like, hey, I'm a fan of integrating with FastAPI,

00:13:50 <v Michael Kennedy>and I want to do WebRTC.

00:13:52 <v Michael Kennedy>It's kind of ridiculous how simple some of these things are.

00:13:55 <v Michael Kennedy>So it's pretty popular.

00:13:56 <v Michael Kennedy>It's got 4,000 GitHub stars, 400 forks.

00:13:59 <v Michael Kennedy>It's been around for a while.

00:14:01 <v Michael Kennedy>Freddie pointed this out to me a decent while ago, <v Michael Kennedy>and I finally ain't getting around to talking about it.

00:14:05 <v Michael Kennedy>But it's quite neat.

00:14:07 <v Michael Kennedy>There's a little video you can watch about how to do it,

00:14:08 <v Michael Kennedy>but it's got some examples for you.

00:14:10 <v Michael Kennedy>Like if you want to do an Echo Audio, <v Michael Kennedy>which is kind of a sadistic example, you know what I mean?

00:14:17 <v Michael Kennedy>Because that's usually the worst thing about a video meeting,

00:14:20 <v Michael Kennedy>is the echo.

00:14:21 <v Michael Kennedy>But if you want to listen to yourself echo back <v Michael Kennedy>just to prove that it's going round and round,

00:14:26 <v Michael Kennedy>then how many lines is that?

00:14:28 <v Michael Kennedy>I mean, there's a huge comma in there, <v Michael Kennedy>but if you take out the comma

00:14:33 <v Michael Kennedy>and you format it a little bit wider, <v Michael Kennedy>it's probably five lines of code to set up a server,

00:14:38 <v Michael Kennedy>connect to it, and echo back.

00:14:39 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, that's insane.

00:14:41 <v Michael Kennedy>Insane.

00:14:42 <v Michael Kennedy>And there's also ways to set up LLM voice chat if you care about that.

00:14:46 <v Michael Kennedy>You know, that's obviously the thing du jour is I want to talk to my LLM.

00:14:52 <v Michael Kennedy>But, you know, you could do that pretty easily, pretty quickly here.

00:14:55 <v Michael Kennedy>But also just stream your webcam back or object detection.

00:14:59 <v Michael Kennedy>It's just like a handful of lines of code.

00:15:00 <v Michael Kennedy>It's insane.

00:15:01 <v Michael Kennedy>But this stuff seems so complicated, doesn't it, Brian?

00:15:04 <v Michael Kennedy>It's cool.

00:15:05 <v Michael Kennedy>It's cool.

00:15:05 <v Brian Okken>You're wrapping stuff up in a library.

00:15:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:15:08 <v Michael Kennedy>So it comes with automatic voice detection, turn-taking built-in, which is interesting.

00:15:14 <v Michael Kennedy>It's got a UI to launch it in built-in Gradio UI, if you want to do that.

00:15:20 <v Michael Kennedy>I believe that's probably JavaScript.

00:15:22 <v Michael Kennedy>Automatic Web RTC support.

00:15:25 <v Michael Kennedy>So mount it onto a FastAPI app and get a Web RTC endpoint for your own front end.

00:15:31 <v Michael Kennedy>So you can kind of go Gradio or you can go this way.

00:15:33 <v Michael Kennedy>It's got WebSocket support.

00:15:35 <v Michael Kennedy>Listen to this.

00:15:36 <v Michael Kennedy>Automatic telephone support.

00:15:37 <v Michael Kennedy>use FastPhone on the string and get your own temporary phone number.

00:15:42 <v Brian Okken>Actually, that's pretty cool.

00:15:44 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:15:45 <v Michael Kennedy>So, yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on here.

00:15:48 <v Michael Kennedy>It says you can easily be mounted on your own FastAPI app

00:15:50 <v Michael Kennedy>and customize it entirely, <v Michael Kennedy>extend it to fit within your production app,

00:15:55 <v Michael Kennedy>I guess, assuming that's a FastAPI app.

00:15:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Although you could certainly squeeze it in using, like,

00:16:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Nginx routes to make it look like one app, <v Michael Kennedy>but it's not exactly the same back end and so on.

00:16:05 <v Michael Kennedy>So there's examples for that.

00:16:06 <v Michael Kennedy>Wow.

00:16:06 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, so I thought it was pretty cool.

00:16:09 <v Brian Okken>That's pretty neat.

00:16:10 <v Brian Okken>I interviewed somebody in like three years ago, 2012, about WebRTC.

00:16:15 <v Brian Okken>They wrote a book on it.

00:16:17 <v Brian Okken>Nice.

00:16:19 <v Brian Okken>I thought, like, I don't think I'd ever use that.

00:16:21 <v Brian Okken>But of course I use tools that use WebRTC all the time.

00:16:24 <v Brian Okken>So like you said, we're using it for.

00:16:26 <v Brian Okken>We're using it right now.

00:16:27 <v Brian Okken>We're using it right now.

00:16:29 <v Michael Kennedy>And yeah, it's one of those things where it's like, <v Michael Kennedy>I don't think I'll ever build one of those.

00:16:33 <v Michael Kennedy>And then you're like, oh, but what if I could do it for this project

00:16:36 <v Michael Kennedy>or something comes up or, you know, just knowing about it as a...

00:16:39 <v Michael Kennedy>I think it's...

00:16:40 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, and right now, like you said, with things like hooking up LLMs to, you know, some vibe coding.

00:16:48 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, exactly.

00:16:49 <v Brian Okken>I mean, no comment.

00:16:51 <v Brian Okken>No comment.

00:16:54 <v Brian Okken>Okay, so this is a listener suggestion, actually.

00:16:57 <v Brian Okken>Comes to us as a request from Nicholas Kersner.

00:17:01 <v Brian Okken>He said, hey, I'm using PipDepTree a lot lately.

00:17:06 <v Brian Okken>And it's pretty cool if you covered that.

00:17:07 <v Brian Okken>And I'm like, yeah, we covered it.

00:17:09 <v Brian Okken>But I looked it up.

00:17:11 <v Brian Okken>It was, I should have had the episode up.

00:17:13 <v Brian Okken>But we covered it in episode 17.

00:17:17 <v Brian Okken>That was what?

00:17:20 <v Brian Okken>2017.

00:17:21 <v Brian Okken>So yeah, it was a minute ago that we've covered it.

00:17:23 <v Brian Okken>So it's totally fine to cover it again <v Brian Okken>because there's been changes.

00:17:27 <v Brian Okken>So I did want to talk about both pip Deptree, <v Brian Okken>but also I have been, I used pip Deptree for a long time,

00:17:34 <v Brian Okken>But now usually I use uv pip tree.

00:17:36 <v Brian Okken>And so I just decided to write an article on it just to, <v Brian Okken>because I wanted to show some code examples.

00:17:42 <v Brian Okken>One of the cool things I did not know that pip dep tree did.

00:17:46 <v Brian Okken>One of the things that I would always do is I'd have a project install pip dep tree.

00:17:51 <v Brian Okken>And what it does is when you run it, <v Brian Okken>it looks at all the stuff you have installed and then shows, shows them.

00:17:56 <v Brian Okken>It's kind of like pip list, but it shows all the, <v Brian Okken>it's like a tree structure and it shows them we're like in a tree structure with

00:18:04 <v Brian Okken>versions that are installed and it kind of it's extra information like the uh like if i'm using

00:18:10 <v Brian Okken>it from pyproject.toml i have an example of the cards project why it chose the particular version

00:18:16 <v Brian Okken>that's installed um so it's pretty handy but the i would always install it in the project and it

00:18:23 <v Brian Okken>would also tell me that pip dep tree is installed but the uh the trick is to install it somewhere

00:18:29 <v Brian Okken>globally like either uh using uh uvx pip dep tree or uv tool install pip dep tree and then you've

00:18:36 <v Brian Okken>got it just available to you always and and then you can use python auto and it the python auto flag

00:18:44 <v Brian Okken>will tell you um it will look in the current environment that you're in so um so then you can

00:18:49 <v Brian Okken>have it in global uh and then yeah and just look at whatever project you're in which is cool i didn't

00:18:56 <v Brian Okken>know it could do the auto thing too so i'm glad i looked that up the um but what i'm using usually

00:19:03 <v Brian Okken>is uv pip tree because it's already installed with uv and i have uv everywhere now by default i wanted

00:19:08 <v Brian Okken>to go through a couple flags that i um actually i just learned about this i i when i was i was

00:19:13 <v Brian Okken>comparing this beauty if you do uv pip tree it'll show you a tree structure but it only shows you

00:19:18 <v Brian Okken>the versions that are installed and it does do like for instance i'm showing cards and rich is showing

00:19:24 <v Brian Okken>up and it looks like it's in a couple places. Package tree already displayed. Oh yeah,

00:19:30 <v Brian Okken>because the cards project depends on rich, but it also depends on typer, which also depends on rich.

00:19:37 <v Brian Okken>So rich is duplicated and there's a little note that says that. There's a flag where you can turn

00:19:41 <v Brian Okken>it off, but I kind of like seeing the duplication. It's just to see who all is using something.

00:19:47 <v Brian Okken>Now, to get a similar look as pip dep tree, you can add show version specifiers and then it shows

00:19:55 <v Brian Okken>that it used to figure out what to install.

00:19:58 <v Brian Okken>But the new flag that I just learned about, <v Brian Okken>which I'm super excited about,

00:20:02 <v Brian Okken>is --outdated.

00:20:04 <v Brian Okken>And this tells you, <v Brian Okken>it tells you, <v Brian Okken>it throws the latest up.

00:20:08 <v Brian Okken>It looks at all the things you got installed <v Brian Okken>and tells you if there's newer ones.

00:20:11 <v Brian Okken>So you can go into your project <v Brian Okken>and you can run UVPIP tree outdated

00:20:15 <v Brian Okken>and it'll tell you which ones you should maybe update.

00:20:18 <v Brian Okken>So it's pretty fun, both of those.

00:20:21 <v Michael Kennedy>So I like both tools.

00:20:22 <v Michael Kennedy>That's nice.

00:20:23 <v Michael Kennedy>I do as well.

00:20:24 <v Michael Kennedy>I've used pip dep tree for a long time.

00:20:26 <v Michael Kennedy>It's nice to just go, why is this here?

00:20:28 <v Michael Kennedy>Why is click installed?

00:20:31 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't remember installing click.

00:20:32 <v Michael Kennedy>It's fine, but I just don't remember installing it.

00:20:35 <v Michael Kennedy>But oh, it's Icy because I installed Typer, <v Michael Kennedy>and I forgot that Typer is a wrapper on click.

00:20:39 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, and one of the things, for instance, <v Brian Okken>I'm thinking about update like a hypothetical scenario.

00:20:46 <v Brian Okken>I've got Rich, or I've got on my cards application, <v Brian Okken>I'm using rich, but maybe I'll try to tighten the dependencies by not using rich.

00:20:56 <v Brian Okken>But if I'm using typer, it's going to come in anyway.

00:20:59 <v Brian Okken>So I like to see the duplication because I'm not going to save anything if I don't depend on rich directly.

00:21:05 <v Brian Okken>It's already there because of typer.

00:21:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Yes, exactly.

00:21:08 <v Michael Kennedy>You're like, can I just get rid of this thing?

00:21:10 <v Michael Kennedy>You're like, nope.

00:21:11 <v Michael Kennedy>No.

00:21:11 <v Brian Okken>Not easily.

00:21:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Not directly anyway.

00:21:14 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:21:14 <v Brian Okken>But if I got rid of typer also somehow and then I could get rid of rich.

00:21:19 <v Brian Okken>And maybe I'll redo the TinyDB too.

00:21:21 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:21:22 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, tighten it up.

00:21:24 <v Brian Okken>All right.

00:21:25 <v Brian Okken>Those are, that's my items to talk about.

00:21:28 <v Brian Okken>Oh, I do have links to both PipTrapTree and uv treeRich.

00:21:33 <v Brian Okken>UV PipTreeRich also.

00:21:36 <v Brian Okken>Those are all different words.

00:21:37 <v Michael Kennedy>Nice.

00:21:38 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:21:38 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, just keep going.

00:21:39 <v Michael Kennedy>You're the only one with extras today.

00:21:41 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:21:41 <v Brian Okken>I got a couple extras.

00:21:43 <v Brian Okken>I've got one of the benefits of working at the office, <v Brian Okken>like the back to office thing is I was walking by one of my colleagues and he's got a bunch of

00:21:51 <v Brian Okken>colors up on his screen. And I'm like, what are those colors? And,  and I use,  use

00:21:58 <v Brian Okken>VS Code at work and the,  and I've often got different projects up the same thing he's using.

00:22:04 <v Brian Okken>And I started using this just like last week, a thing called peacock. and what it does is it

00:22:10 <v Brian Okken>shows different colors around the outside of your,  terminal and it only it's, or outside of your

00:22:16 <v Brian Okken>VS Code window, but the colors are picked and stored in the project or like the workspace.

00:22:23 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, the workspace.

00:22:25 <v Brian Okken>So that if you've got different projects open, they all have different colors.

00:22:29 <v Brian Okken>So when you're like, I want to go back to that window, you just have to remember which

00:22:33 <v Brian Okken>color goes to which project.

00:22:34 <v Brian Okken>And that's kind of up to you.

00:22:36 <v Brian Okken>But Brian, I'm often still this.

00:22:39 <v Brian Okken>I in even if you one of the cool things is I'm like, well, I chose green and it's a little

00:22:45 <v Brian Okken>too bright for me.

00:22:46 <v Brian Okken>I kind of wanted a darker green.

00:22:48 <v Brian Okken>It has built-in buttons to just go a little darker, <v Brian Okken>a little darker, a little darker, or a little lighter.

00:22:54 <v Brian Okken>You can do custom, like pick your own color, <v Brian Okken>but you can also say, this is close,

00:22:59 <v Brian Okken>but I'd like it a little darker.

00:23:00 <v Michael Kennedy>And I'm loving that.

00:23:02 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and it's not incredibly popular, <v Michael Kennedy>but it looks like it's from John Papa,

00:23:05 <v Michael Kennedy>who's been around in the tech space for a long time.

00:23:07 <v Michael Kennedy>So it seems trustworthy.

00:23:09 <v Brian Okken>Where do you see the popularity?

00:23:10 <v Brian Okken>Is it in here?

00:23:11 <v Brian Okken>It's the downloads.

00:23:13 <v Brian Okken>Oh, I take it back.

00:23:14 <v Michael Kennedy>I thought it was, it may have more than I initially, <v Michael Kennedy>said it has three point basically four million downloads okay so actually there's a few downloads

00:23:21 <v Michael Kennedy>people like this idea oh i was looking at the um the open vsx marketplace which is like a similar

00:23:28 <v Brian Okken>but not the same uh the other update so one of the things i mentioned last week is that i'm writing

00:23:33 <v Brian Okken>a book again and um i just updated uh this last night i think last night there's um a chapter

00:23:41 <v Brian Okken>another chapter written so i gotta clean this up both versions are here but i did essential

00:23:46 <v Brian Okken>for successful software projects.

00:23:48 <v Brian Okken>I got that one up <v Brian Okken>and I completely rewrote the introduction

00:23:52 <v Brian Okken>and I should stop doing that.

00:23:54 <v Brian Okken>An editor a long time ago told me, <v Brian Okken>do a quick introduction

00:23:58 <v Brian Okken>and then leave it alone <v Brian Okken>until you finish the book

00:24:00 <v Brian Okken>and then you can update it <v Brian Okken>to be what the book actually is.

00:24:03 <v Brian Okken>And so I got to do that.

00:24:04 <v Michael Kennedy>A hundred percent.

00:24:05 <v Michael Kennedy>I think that's a great idea <v Michael Kennedy>about the introduction.

00:24:08 <v Michael Kennedy>I do it with my courses.

00:24:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Sometimes I'll record the whole course <v Michael Kennedy>and then I'll record the introduction

00:24:12 <v Michael Kennedy>because I'm like, <v Michael Kennedy>I want to be able to say,

00:24:13 <v Michael Kennedy>and we're going to cover this <v Michael Kennedy>in this section

00:24:15 <v Michael Kennedy>and then actually have that match.

00:24:17 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, but my brain won't let me go on <v Brian Okken>if I don't write an introduction to start with.

00:24:22 <v Brian Okken>It's like, but I haven't done an introduction, man.

00:24:25 <v Brian Okken>And the essential components chapter, <v Brian Okken>this was tough, man,

00:24:29 <v Brian Okken>because there's like, <v Brian Okken>I needed it to be tight

00:24:31 <v Brian Okken>or I wanted it to be a tight chapter, <v Brian Okken>but I rewrote it like five times

00:24:36 <v Brian Okken>because I had so many stories and stuff <v Brian Okken>I wanted to throw in

00:24:38 <v Brian Okken>and I decided to take the stories out <v Brian Okken>and leave those stories as blog posts later.

00:24:43 <v Brian Okken>But, oh, I guess the third extra, <v Brian Okken>I don't have anything to show for this, but when I'm writing and I've got all this great stuff that I want to save, but I know it shouldn't be in this chapter or it shouldn't be in this blog post.

00:24:54 <v Brian Okken>I've decided for my editor, I've got a file called cut bucket, like CUT bucket.

00:25:00 <v Brian Okken>And I just put a divider line, put another title and paste the stuff I want to save there.

00:25:06 <v Brian Okken>And then I don't.

00:25:07 <v Brian Okken>And then my brain, it's a brain trick is I haven't thrown it away.

00:25:10 <v Brian Okken>It's there.

00:25:11 <v Brian Okken>You don't have to remember it and move on with writing.

00:25:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:25:15 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, awesome.

00:25:16 <v Michael Kennedy>What's your editor that you're writing in?

00:25:18 <v Brian Okken>Like, do you have a markdown?

00:25:19 <v Michael Kennedy>What is the story?

00:25:20 <v Brian Okken>Oh, yeah, it's markdown in VS Code.

00:25:23 <v Brian Okken>And so the pytest book had tons of code snippets and everything.

00:25:27 <v Brian Okken>I think this is going to be a code snippet-free book.

00:25:31 <v Brian Okken>So that I can, the goal is to do an audio version later.

00:25:35 <v Brian Okken>And, you know, I might have some code snippets, but probably not.

00:25:39 <v Brian Okken>Actually, it's one of the things of reading the Tester of Development book

00:25:43 <v Brian Okken>from the old, the OG one from Kent Beck.

00:25:47 <v Brian Okken>It's all in Java, I think.

00:25:50 <v Brian Okken>And it's like too much.

00:25:51 <v Brian Okken>You're lucky it's not Smalltalk.

00:25:52 <v Brian Okken>Well, right.

00:25:54 <v Brian Okken>Maybe it is Smalltalk.

00:25:55 <v Brian Okken>I don't know.

00:25:55 <v Brian Okken>I think it's, I don't remember.

00:25:57 <v Brian Okken>But I just sort of scammed by the code snippets <v Brian Okken>because I'm like, I don't care.

00:26:03 <v Brian Okken>I'm just like here for the concepts.

00:26:05 <v Brian Okken>So I'm trying to keep this book, <v Brian Okken>the concepts and not the code

00:26:08 <v Brian Okken>because the code is different for everybody, man.

00:26:11 <v Michael Kennedy>Absolutely.

00:26:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway.

00:26:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Love it.

00:26:13 <v Michael Kennedy>That's all I got.

00:26:14 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:26:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, let's tell a joke then and close it out.

00:26:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:26:19 <v Michael Kennedy>I've done a few AI ones.

00:26:20 <v Michael Kennedy>It's not an AI joke, folks.

00:26:22 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you're tired of the AI jokes, well, then don't worry.

00:26:25 <v Michael Kennedy>This isn't a AI.

00:26:25 <v Michael Kennedy>This one is a joke about the future of Python and people being stuck in their ways or having

00:26:32 <v Michael Kennedy>assumptions about Python not being as fast as it could be or having limitations that it

00:26:37 <v Michael Kennedy>doesn't have anymore, theoretically, or semi-theoretically, whatever.

00:26:41 <v Michael Kennedy>And it's a woman in a walker, probably 70 or so, with the granddaughter helping her back to sit down or something.

00:26:53 <v Michael Kennedy>So I think I named, what did I name the project, the joke here?

00:26:58 <v Michael Kennedy>I think I called it, okay, Grandma, it's the joke.

00:27:01 <v Michael Kennedy>So, honey, do you know that the gil prevents multiple Python threads from executing parallel?

00:27:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Sure, Grandma, let's get you back to bed.

00:27:13 <v Michael Kennedy>a bit of a testament to python 314 and python t and free thread python and all that that'd be

00:27:19 <v Brian Okken>that's funny i can just like fast forward i can imagine like me 10 years from now telling the kids

00:27:24 <v Brian Okken>you know was that when i was a kid we had a GIL we had a one thread at a time

00:27:30 <v Michael Kennedy>your little whippersnappers don't know how good you got it my python used to just run

00:27:35 <v Michael Kennedy>interpreted and it was so slow we would debate whether it was fast enough

00:27:41 <v Michael Kennedy>uh yeah anyway that's what i got for a joke for us i like it

00:27:46 <v Brian Okken>yeah all right it worked for me i liked it so nice all right well uh thanks everybody for joining

00:27:54 <v Brian Okken>and listening and we love you all and um we'll talk to you next week yeah thanks brian thanks
