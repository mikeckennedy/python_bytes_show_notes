00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
- Hello and welcome to Python Bytes


00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.060
where we deliver news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.280
This is episode 309, recorded November 8th, election day.


00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.360
I am Brian Okken.


00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.600
- And I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.520
- Okay, now let's look at your thing.


00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.080
- So first of all, we designed the Python Bytes website


00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.160
to make it like responsive.


00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.800
So even like the table gets like super cool


00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.640
when you just scroll up.


00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.680
But that's not what I wanna talk about.


00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.000
That's not why I brought it up.


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.840
I mean, I always get these emails.


00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.700
I know you haven't logged into our site in five years,


00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.700
but we've redesigned it.


00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.340
Let's tell you about like, no, I don't care.


00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.900
The reason I'm on this page, what is the date today?


00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.860
November what?


00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.460
- It's the eighth.


00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.300
- It's the eighth.


00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.940
Yesterday was Python Bytes birthday.


00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.420
Six years old now.


00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.260
- Oh my gosh.


00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.940
Can't believe it's been six years.


00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.560
- Yeah, six years.


00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.800
The intro to the show in pip nine is out.


00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.500
What are we on like pip 30?


00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.900
I don't know, I haven't paid attention.


00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.780
- Well, they went from--


00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.400
- It's past 20 for sure.


00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.940
- They went from a SemVer to CalVer.


00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.340
So you can't, it's hard to count.


00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.460
- Still been a long time.


00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.740
>> Yeah. >> Absolutely. All right.


00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.280
Well, anyway, happy birthday to us.


00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.100
Let's jump in.


00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.900
>> Yay, we should write cake.


00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.140
>> I know, cake.


00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.500
We have to use cake emoji somewhere today, I suppose.


00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.380
All right. So I want to tell you about something that really touches on


00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.300
the cybersecurity pen testing, red team, blue team, hacker side.


00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.820
I don't know if people are aware,


00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.980
but Python is used a lot for the pen testing security side of the world.


00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.020
We've had some guests on the show here before that talked about their work, right?


00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.340
We're like, "We don't understand this.


00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460
You got to come share this with people yourself."


00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.300
It's awesome, but we're not worthy.


00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.060
But there's a really interesting set of research,


00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.700
and this research came from Sofiane Yadmani,


00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.700
and Robin Thay, and Olga Gagliataska.


00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.020
Sorry if I butchered everyone's name there.


00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.660
But the title of the official academic articles is out of Norway, I think.


00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.940
how security professionals are being attacked,


00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.820
a study of malicious CVE proof of concept exploits in GitHub.


00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.180
Have you run across this?


00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.060
>> No. Interesting.


00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.300
>> It sounds like it doesn't totally


00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.780
apply as maybe a Python programmer thing,


00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.740
but here's the deal.


00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.340
In order to win these CVEs,


00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.040
these vulnerabilities come out and get announced,


00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.380
a lot of times people are like, "Oh my gosh,


00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.860
there's some problem," but what does it manifest like?


00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.700
If I'm going to write some code to explore it,


00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.640
understand it to do all the various things,


00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.680
how do I get started, right?


00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.420
A lot of these are super complicated.


00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.400
And so what people will do is they'll post


00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.280
a simple proof of concept, like imagine


00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.280
you've got a sandboxed web browser


00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.780
and it shouldn't be able to access,


00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.860
like for example, your processes


00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.360
and other parts of your file system.


00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.940
So if I went to a webpage, I could make it pop up,


00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.660
I don't know, notepad with the text,


00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.280
na na na na na, we got you.


00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.120
You know, something silly like that.


00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.840
You're like, oh my God, it opened notepad.


00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.520
Well, these people did some research


00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.520
and they found 47,000 posted proofs of concept.


00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.200
And let's see, somewhere, it's in the article,


00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.800
they talk about the actual language breakdown.


00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.640
Here you go.


00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.720
So when they said, what languages are these written in?


00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.720
HTML, 300, Ruby, 300, Go, 400, C++, 1,000, Python, 8,000.


00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.320
So that's a lot, right?


00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.440
So Python is by a factor of eight, the most common language that they are able to determine


00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.440
the language of the exploit.


00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.120
So it's something that really kind of applies to us.


00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.480
And of the, how many were there?


00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.680
There was like 47,000 of them.


00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.600
And out of those, 4,800 or 10% were malicious, which sounds like, so what?


00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.600
It's a proof of concept of a malicious thing.


00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.440
No, it's like a meta malicious.


00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.440
So here's the deal.


00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.040
we will show you how you can break into Active Directory on this new exploit.


00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.040
What it really does is installs ransomware on your computer.


00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.040
So if you as a person are like,


00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.540
I want to try this out and see if our system is vulnerable,


00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.240
like instead of it doing what it said it would do,


00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.240
it just takes over your computer.


00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.240
And there's various ways in which it does it.


00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.740
It might contact like a known malicious.


00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.040
No, I know.


00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.040
There are some lulls in there to be sure, but


00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.360
But the idea is there's some,


00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.780
it'll take your SSH keys and upload them to some malicious pastebin type place,


00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.220
or it will install crypto miners,


00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.020
or it'll install ransomware,


00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.060
encryption types of things.


00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.360
A few of them say,


00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.580
you shouldn't have just run code off the Internet.


00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.860
What are you doing? It'll like rickroll you.


00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.700
But the majority of them take over for real.


00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.060
Isn't that nuts?


00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.580
>> Yeah.


00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.300
>> Yeah.


00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.900
>> Recurls are hilarious though, just saying.


00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.660
>> They are. Even in the paper,


00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.460
there's actually some Python proof of code.


00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.820
Here let me show you down here,


00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:00.180
pull this up. I don't know how to link to a code listing inside of a PDF,


00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.340
so I'm just going to cruise. Here we go.


00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.140
For example, over here.


00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.180
Here it says, this is an example of one of


00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.180
these proof of concepts that shows you how things might work.


00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.460
What is it going to do?


00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.600
It's going to go and say it's going to sleep for a second,


00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.380
get your host name, create a user thing,


00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.660
da-da-da-da-da, and then oddly,


00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.740
instead of saying the URL is a thing,


00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.780
the URL is a base 64 decoded,


00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.760
encoded bunch of garbage.


00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.060
What is this? This is


00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.540
the malicious website that they're going to send your information to.


00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.520
But when you look at it, it doesn't look like here's the virus.


00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.620
It's like, "Oh, they're just decoding this text.


00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.300
I see." No, no, no, no.


00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.020
This is the virus right there.


00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.860
There's way more complicated examples,


00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.740
but you know, pretty nuts anyway.


00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.580
What's the format?


00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.660
If you were serious, they should really run black on this.


00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.140
I know they totally, they totally should.


00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.780
You deserve what you get if you run that now.


00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.740
This is a pretty interesting thing.


00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.380
And if you're in the security space, you know, if there's a 10% chance of just


00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.340
checking out one of these proof of concepts that you'll get owned, you know,


00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.460
just be aware of it.


00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.300
You consider the audience of the people creating these.


00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.660
So I guess, you know, a bunch of hackers are like, Hey, I made this code.


00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.340
You should try it.


00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.360
But no, but actually we should have like a search thing or something like that.


00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.120
'Cause that base 64 decode thing is a classic,


00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.040
just don't touch it sort of thing.


00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.960
Especially if it's going into a URL or something.


00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.400
This is, it's not good.


00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.840
- Yeah, they did come up with a way


00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.680
to automatically test for things.


00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.840
They said, look, if it's contacting a well-known,


00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.320
malicious command and control type IP address,


00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.880
which there's a listing, a database of these types of things.


00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.520
It's like, you know what, that's a problem.


00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.520
And here's a proof of concept


00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.160
that should have nothing to do with the internet,


00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.400
and it's uploading data.


00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.940
that doesn't seem like it should, right?


00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.100
Or it's downloading this data from somewhere else.


00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.940
Yeah.


00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.760
- Yeah.


00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.360
- Yeah, I like that Kim has got the,


00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.920
he's got the glass half full.


00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.740
A base 64 encoded URL is surely completely safe


00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.940
and nothing to worry about.


00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.020
And Marco is concerned about the SSH keys.


00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.860
Kind of got me.


00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.680
- Yeah.


00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.660
- And thanks for the happy birthday wishes


00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.340
out in the audience as well from everyone.


00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.060
- Yeah, yeah, thanks people.


00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.100
- All right, Brian, that's all I got.


00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.340
But there's a really cool paper.


00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.700
There's some proof of concepts in there.


00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.780
There's a couple of write-ups on it.


00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.620
It's worth checking out.


00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.520
- Okay, cool.


00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.400
Well, I actually want to talk about something


00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.100
completely sort of different.


00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.100
So if you've, let's just, I'll go to us for a second.


00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.800
If normally I get a lot of my news from people on Twitter,


00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.520
but Twitter kind of is in the news lately


00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.960
'cause things are kind of going weird with Twitter.


00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.840
So what are people doing?


00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.160
Well, a lot of people, a lot of people actually


00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.000
are checking out Mastodon.


00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.900
So I'm calling this the great Mastodon experiment


00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.140
because tons of us, Python people,


00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.380
and actually tons of tech people


00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.780
and tons of other people also


00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.400
are trying out this Mastodon thing.


00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.720
And in the back of our mind, it was,


00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.540
well, like, yeah, Mastodon seems kind of interesting.


00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.260
It's like a sort of maybe alternative to Twitter,


00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.780
but not many people there.


00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.060
Now there's a lot of people there, like tons of people.


00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.280
I don't know what the numbers are


00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.940
compared to Twitter, of course, but anyway.


00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.460
So I am part of this.


00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.380
I'm part of the people that have switched.


00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.220
But if you like here, we're showing the Mastodon,


00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.980
like join mastodon.org site.


00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.580
And the first thing you wanna do,


00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.680
okay, I wanna try this.


00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.720
So I have to, okay, I have to create an account.


00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.700
So the first thing you're hit is,


00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.640
well, which server do you wanna use?


00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.140
I was stuck here for a while and I'm like,


00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.100
I don't know what to do.


00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.300
So I went ahead and I used Twitter and I asked,


00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.660
and Will was there from,


00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.500
Will said he's on mastodon.social.


00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.980
Will McGugan and I just asked,


00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.820
I'm still stuck on the chooses server.


00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.020
What are people using?


00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.540
And I got one reply right away saying,


00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.700
well, fostered on.org has Anthony Shaw


00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.180
and a bunch of other people.


00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.380
I'm like good enough for me.


00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.940
So I went ahead and picked it.


00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.660
So I am now on fostered on also.


00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.860
And then I'm just trying stuff.


00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.940
I'm like, just trying it out, playing it,


00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.100
playing with it, following some people, commenting, whatever.


00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.180
And so far I kind of like it.


00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.500
It's nice.


00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.920
Now, now that I've kind of like, I got the basics down,


00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.440
now I'm ready to learn some more.


00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.820
And so I put together,


00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.180
went through and found some tutorials.


00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.260
So if anybody else wants to try this also,


00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
I found some kind of fun tutorials.


00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.100
There's one that's called


00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.260
the Increasingly Less Brief Guide to Mastodon.


00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.860
It's big, but it's, so it, that's nice though.


00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.200
It starts out with like, with like short answers,


00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.980
like, you know, what is it?


00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.100
How is it like Twitter?


00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.520
How is it not like Twitter, stuff like that.


00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.160
And one of the things, comparisons that confused me a bit


00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.960
was how is it like email?


00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.640
But I didn't get the analogy at first, but I kind of do now.


00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.720
So the idea is you have to pick a server,


00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.400
but you can still follow people on other servers.


00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.120
Just like if you have a Gmail account,


00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.780
you can still email people that are not in Gmail, works.


00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.000
So there's that, there's everything I know about Mastodon.


00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.840
- Sorry, but it reminds me a little bit of like BBSs.


00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.840
Remember, like you go to BBS and write email,


00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.680
and then they would like sync at night


00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.960
and then you might get email from some other BBS.


00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.120
- Well, yeah, that's something I also noticed


00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.760
that at first I was a little annoyed


00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.120
because like it's not as zippy sometimes.


00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.880
Like it's growing a lot.


00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.680
So a lot of these servers are like adding capacity.


00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.520
And so occasionally, like the other day,


00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.680
the Fostadon server was down for a couple hours


00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.160
and I'm like, oh my God, actually I'll be fine


00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.520
if I don't use a social media app for two hours, just chill.


00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.760
And so, yeah, it's interesting.


00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.080
There's a lot of stuff I've learned so far.


00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.720
Like, it's not filtering what I'm seeing.


00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.880
I actually just see everything that people write


00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.760
that I'm following.


00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.520
Actually, isn't that what I wanted?


00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.240
So I'm pretty okay with it.


00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.800
So I put together, I'll go through a couple of these.


00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.800
There's everything I know.


00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.120
It's targeted towards data science people,


00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.520
but there's a lot of great info there.


00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.280
There's, and then Simon Willison, he's trying this out too,


00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.800
said is Mastodon is just blogs.


00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.560
So I was confused by that,


00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.440
but he describes how it's like,


00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.920
it uses this active pub feature


00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.680
and it's into a little details,


00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.120
but I think he knows what he's talking about


00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.620
because he wrote his own,


00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.840
he's on his own server.


00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.100
So you can have your own,


00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.240
you can have your own Mastodon server.


00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.980
But some of the people trying it out at the same time,


00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.920
we've got some big names, Lucas Lange,


00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.280
he's trying it out.


00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.280
He linked to a couple of things like that he's learning about,


00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.240
it's really supposed to repost in multiple places, things like that.


00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.280
I've got Brett Cannon figuring it out.


00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.560
A lot of us over here having a little bit of fun with Mastodon.


00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.360
>> That's fantastic. Yeah. So fosstodon.org


00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.560
is the free and open-source software Mastodon 1, right?


00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.480
>> Yeah. But a lot of people are on.


00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.640
A lot of people are on Mastodon.social.


00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.200
Here's a cool article.


00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:04.980
Oh yeah, clients wise, there's a whole bunch of iPhone clients too, but you can use it on the web or anything.


00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:11.380
Lucas is on, or Lokesh, I'm sorry, is on Mastodon Social also.


00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.240
Brett's on Fosstodon, but there's a whole bunch of others as well.


00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.040
Yeah, you have to apply to get in there.


00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.240
So I applied, but I have not been let in yet, so hopefully they will find me worthy and I can join you.


00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.040
Okay.


00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.040
We'll see.


00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.440
>> I know some of them are,


00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.980
since these are private things,


00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.120
there's got people running their own servers.


00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.840
There's funding models on each of them.


00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.460
Like Fossadon, for instance,


00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.440
said they want to make sure that they always have


00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.360
six months of running time or something like that.


00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.120
That's cool enough for me. Anyway.


00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.400
>> Yeah. I'd be happy to pay a dollar or two a month just to have


00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.800
no ads and have a well-curated, somewhat not terrible space.


00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.200
So yeah, I wasn't really getting to get into the politics of it, but the whole $8 a month


00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.040
thing, actually, if I could have got rid of ads and actually got some other cool features,


00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.560
I probably would have paid it anyway.


00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.040
I just don't want to pay it now.


00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.880
I'd be like two months ago, I probably would have been up for it, but I don't want to do


00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.880
that right now.


00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.880
Yeah, I don't know.


00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.640
I have no intention of leaving Twitter at the moment.


00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.800
There's still like a really valuable community for the podcast listeners and stuff.


00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.800
But I do think it's also super interesting to reach out to these other spaces.


00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.120
is one it's it's kind of interesting in that it's there's a bunch of little islands and the thing


00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.400
that's cool about Twitter is you go to the the continent and then you find your space within


00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.120
that and it's like here you got it what is the like the place I go to I'm telling you this is


00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.080
like bbs's like what what bbs has the place where there's kind of cool conversations and good games


00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.280
I can play and you dial that one up or we could just go back to like you know planet python


00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.560
and rss feeds for everybody yeah yeah nothing wrong with rss cool well thanks for bringing


00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.160
I have some more thoughts on this as well later, but for now.


00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.440
For now, maybe we could talk about our sponsor.


00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.280
What do you think?


00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.560
- We should talk about our sponsor


00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.920
because it's cool that we have one,


00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.440
but also it's Microsoft.


00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.880
So this episode of Python Bytes is brought to you


00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.640
by Microsoft for Startups.


00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.840
But starting a business is hard.


00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.920
Most startups go out of business within the first year,


00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.080
which is totally lame.


00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.360
So Microsoft for Startups set out to understand


00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.580
what startups need to be successful


00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.200
and created a digital platform


00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.440
to help you overcome those challenges.


00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.780
And they came up with Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub.


00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.520
The Founders Hub provides all founders at any stage


00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.600
with free resources to help solve startup challenges.


00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.980
The platform provides technology benefits,


00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.760
access to expert guidance and skilled resources,


00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.720
mentorship and network connections, and so much more.


00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.320
Unlike others in the industry,


00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.160
Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub


00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.320
doesn't require startups to be investor backed


00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.880
or third party validated to participate.


00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.600
Founders Hub is truly open to all.


00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.760
You can speed up development with free access


00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.700
to GitHub and Microsoft Cloud.


00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:05.140
And there's other partners that they partners with


00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.600
such as OpenAI, you can get discounts through there.


00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.720
So you'll have access to those extra resources,


00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.600
but you also get access to their mentorship network,


00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.480
which includes hundreds of mentors


00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.080
across a range of disciplines.


00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.240
Need advice on marketing, fundraising,


00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.640
Idea validation, maybe?


00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.680
Tons of topics that you might need help on,


00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.160
including management and coaching,


00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.220
and you'll be able to book a one-to-one meeting,


00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.780
one-on-one meeting with mentors,


00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.360
many of whom were former founders themselves.


00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.480
It's no longer about who you know.


00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.100
Get critical support you need


00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.720
from Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub.


00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.920
Make your idea a reality today.


00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.440
To join the program, visit pythonbytes.fm/foundershub2022,

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.820
And I know you can find this on your own by Googling,


00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.440
but using that link in the show notes will help them


00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.780
know that you found it through this podcast.


00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:54.620
Thanks.


00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.440
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.280
Thank you, Microsoft.


00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.320
- Oh, you're on mute.


00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.220
- I am.


00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.240
Thank you, Microsoft.


00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.240
And yeah, let's move on.


00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.520
A couple of these things are about continued journeys.


00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.080
Sometimes we're on a journey, you know?


00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.920
- Yeah.


00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.920
- And switch it over.


00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.360
Siri over on Twitter, not mastered on yet,


00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.160
sent me, sent us a message and said,


00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.200
"Hey, nice episode."


00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.680
You know, remember I was on this,


00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.120
I talked about like Panix, SSH,


00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.720
thing called prompt and some of the other ways I was trying to like,


00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.320
well, how do I just take my iPad and no keyboards and no extra stuff and just


00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.520
have a little Devopsy coding environment.


00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.560
Theory says, you should check out Gitpod.


00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.640
Have you heard of Gitpod?


00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.280
>> No.


00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.120
>> No. Pod as in pods from Kubernetes.


00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.760
But here, he says,


00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.040
basically I'll just pull up and show you what it is.


00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.980
So if you go over here, the idea is, it says,


00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.340
"Always ready to code."


00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.400
Like, that sounds cool, right?


00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.980
And I love, look at this little graphic, right?


00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.980
Okay, you're like, your chair is an enter button.


00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.900
I love it.


00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.580
- Oh, I didn't notice that right at first.


00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.400
That's cool.


00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.220
- Yeah, and by the way, they just, this happened,


00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.100
I think, since this got sent over,


00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.820
they just raved a $25 million Series A round.


00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.980
So there's a good, you know,


00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.140
there's a lot of effort behind this, right?


00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.880
Gitpod is, I believe there's an open source version,


00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.380
and then like a hosted version as well.


00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.260
So the idea is, what you can do is I can go


00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.100
and it'll create a Kubernetes Docker type image


00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.380
that I can configure.


00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.540
So basically a Linux machine that's isolated for me,


00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.460
which is nice.


00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.980
And then I can log into it one of two ways.


00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.780
I can log into it in the browser,


00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.660
and just like if you go to github.dev,


00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.020
which is what I suggested before,


00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.820
in the browser this connects to your own environment,


00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.540
which the thing that's cool about this


00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.300
is it's that environment you have a root access


00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.540
to do whatever you want to it.


00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.040
So if you got a pip install something that's weird


00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:51.980
or whatever, like you're not like,


00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.740
oh, well, sorry, you can't install this dependency,


00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.580
too bad, right?


00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.400
It's just, it's yours.


00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.340
You do whatever you want with it.


00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.220
That's in the browser.


00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.640
So on your iPad browser, for example,


00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.260
or if you happen to be on the desktop


00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.960
and what you want is just like a,


00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.220
I'm on an arm machine and I want an x86 machine,


00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.700
or I want a Linux machine that's like production


00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.980
and that is not just my Mac or my Windows machine.


00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.500
You can actually connect to it with a full on VS Code


00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.500
or even PyCharm, you can plug directly into it


00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.800
and remotely edit locally on PyCharm locally,


00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.580
but then like debug and run your environment there.


00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.420
- Wow, that's really cool.


00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.800
- Yeah, it also works for IntelliJ, the Go,


00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.660
basically all the VS Code and all the JetBrains IDEs,


00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.540
which is like a huge long list, and Vim, and also Vimit.


00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.540
- Wow.


00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.820
- Anyway, this is really cool.


00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.740
And there's one of the recommendations


00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.060
or like the reasons for it, it says,


00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.900
look, you can do multi-track development.


00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.900
So if I'm doing like, I'm working on a feature branch


00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.820
and I'm working on main dev and I'm trying to do a bug fix,


00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.180
instead of staging or stashing and then checking out


00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.660
and then try that and then check over the other thing,


00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.260
unstack, like juggling one working environment,


00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.460
you can have multiples of these Git pods,


00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.820
one for each part of your project even.


00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.820
Bring it closer to your Linux and Docker runtime.


00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.740
You can even do like paired programming on it,


00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.060
which is kind of interesting.


00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.700
And here they got an example of it running on an iPad.


00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.020
And apparently you can install


00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.900
like a bunch of different extensions and stuff


00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.700
and like configure up your thing.


00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.500
So there's an open source version,


00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.000
which is free from big tech influence.


00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.620
But there's also, you can get their version on the cloud


00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.580
or you can self host it or whatever, right?


00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.500
And so there is a paid component to this.


00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.860
Like this, you know, they got $25 million, right?


00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.420
It's not just like to set on fire, although maybe.


00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.420
There's a free version,


00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.300
which gives you 50 hours of code in a month.


00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.140
That's pretty good.


00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.760
Or you can pay $9 a month for 100 hours,


00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.800
or there's like other higher tiers, 25, 40 bucks and stuff.


00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.220
But it's open source and there's some free versions


00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.620
and reasonably priced versions.


00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.540
And yeah, I don't know, I think it's pretty cool.


00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.300
So thanks Theory for sending it over.


00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.700
And you know, it's definitely an option out there.


00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.900
- Yeah, and the self-hosted also is,


00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.500
Looks like an option as well.


00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.340
- Yeah, exactly.


00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.160
So you can self-host.


00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.540
I think you basically probably set up a Kubernetes cluster


00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.740
and like it, it connects and goes against that.


00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.540
- Oh yeah, just throw up a Kubernetes cluster.


00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.380
- Yeah, exactly.


00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.220
(laughing)


00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.040
Cool, all right.


00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.660
Well, I haven't, I did play around with it


00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.860
and it worked pretty well,


00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.540
but I haven't done anything serious.


00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.820
- It still looks cool though.


00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.740
I like it.


00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.700
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.340
All right, what's your last one here?


00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.100
- Oh, last one is a short one.


00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.380
I just wanted to talk about terminal colors.


00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.380
So I've got a little pytest plugin called pytestCheck,


00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.740
and it's got some terminal output,


00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.660
but it does talk about failures,


00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.660
and somebody completely reasonably submitted an issue


00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.660
and said, "It'd be cool if these were red


00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.260
"so you could see them easier."


00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.320
And I'm like, "Yeah, that would be cool."


00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.140
So what should I do?


00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.940
Well, I could, you know, Will, I wanna let you know


00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.840
that the first thing I thought about


00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.960
was I could throw a rich at it.


00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.520
So I can use rich to put red in the terminal.


00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.640
But rich is, now rich is awesome.


00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.400
I love rich, but maybe it's a bit of a big hammer


00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.640
for just adding one color, just adding red.


00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.480
So I went looking around a little bit


00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.440
and there's term color and there's colorama,


00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.440
there's other things.


00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.120
I ended up, I'm looking at colorama right now,


00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.080
is what I'm playing with.


00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.860
So Colorama is used by a lot of applications.


00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.260
And one of the reasons why is because it helps


00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.740
with the cross, being able to use colors


00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.780
on both Windows and everything else.


00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.020
Windows is a little special.


00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.220
It doesn't act like the other stuff.


00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.300
So you have to do things a bit special.


00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.520
And I was kind of glad I looked at this


00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.580
because one of the things that came up recently


00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.940
in one of the new versions is Colorama has a thing


00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.320
called just fix Windows console.


00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.460
It's just from Colorama import,


00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.980
just fix Windows console, and you call that.


00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.300
After you call that,


00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.380
then if you run your application on Windows,


00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:16.380
it acts just like a normal TTY terminal on Linux or Mac or something.


00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.100
>> Oh, wow.


00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.460
>> At least in terms of a lot of stuff.


00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.300
The other thing that just fix Windows console,


00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.760
I think I got this right,


00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.620
is you used to have to call a knit,


00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.240
and now you call this other thing,


00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.920
But you can you can call that on Mac also and it just doesn't hurt anything.


00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.920
It's fine.


00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.120
So you can.


00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.380
And now after you've done that in it and there's a whole bunch of text here


00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.540
that I just skimmed really briefly, I just wanted it to work.


00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.780
Just call that.


00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:46.980
And then you can use these these color codes like for four dot red, for instance.


00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.940
That's what I wanted.


00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.920
Some red text.


00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.880
And there I've got it.


00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.880
So after you change, change stuff around, you also have to reset it.


00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.180
So there's a reset code.


00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.900
Now you can do the same thing and it has it on their read me,


00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:06.380
is you can use the hex or whatever color code escape sequences.


00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:11.780
Backslash 033 bracket 31m is red,


00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.740
but I think I'll go with the named ones.


00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.220
>> How about some constants instead?


00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:24.260
>> Yeah. This is pretty cool and I think this is where I'm going to go


00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.800
with adding red to the pytest check.


00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.880
If you want just a little bit of color and


00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.940
nothing that you need rich for,


00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.080
Colorama might be what you want.


00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.520
>> Nice. Colorama is definitely a go-to for me when I just want,


00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.920
this needs to be red or green.


00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.640
It just needs to stand out somehow.


00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.940
For sure, it's very cool.


00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:42.640
>> Yeah. Cool.


00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.920
>> Awesome. All right. Well, that brings us to our extras.


00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.040
>> Yeah. Do you have any extras?


00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.400
>> You know I do. Let's see.


00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.240
Some of these are quick,


00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.320
some are slightly more.


00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.700
Roman Wright, who often we find here in the live streams as well,


00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.860
maker of Beanie, love Beanie.


00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.280
Beanie is powering pythonbytes.fm,


00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.380
by the way, for various other things.


00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.020
So super awesome.


00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:12.840
He'd been thinking, and so Beanie is Pydantic plus MongoDB Async.


00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.680
So there's plenty of reasons why we might want a synchronous API.


00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.180
I'm just in the middle of some script and I just need to talk to the database real quick.


00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.640
Like, do I really need to upgrade this whole thing to handle async code?


00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.060
shouldn't there just be a way to call it?


00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.900
There should.


00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.080
And so he created a derivative or mirrored version


00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.760
that is like Beanie, but has a synchronous set of APIs


00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.280
instead of asynchronous APIs called Bunnet,


00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.880
which I don't know the word Bunnet,


00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.880
but I think it has something to do with,


00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.440
like something to do with a bean, I'm not sure.


00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.700
But anyway, Bunnet, it's similar to Beanie,


00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.880
except for you just don't await things, right?


00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.560
You just use the Pype Mongo base


00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.960
instead of the motor client under the hood.


00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.220
and then you just do thing insert or thing.find one or whatever.


00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.800
People can check that out if they're into Beanie,


00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.200
but they don't want the async version.


00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.720
Yeah, it's brand new.


00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.280
>> I just looked it up, a bunnet is a type of hat.


00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.640
It's like a Scottish hat.


00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.320
>> Well, that would explain the icon here.


00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.680
Maybe it looks like a bean, but it's actually a hat.


00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.240
Rowan's here. Hey, Rowan.


00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.080
So this is a Scottish word. Fabulous.


00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.440
Will McGugan is a bun is a hat worn by old Scottish men.


00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:22.940
Lovely.


00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.480
Awesome.


00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.160
And congrats, Roman, on getting that out there.


00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.640
That's awesome.


00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.520
PyCon, you brought up PyCon 2023 last week.


00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:32.760
Yeah.


00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:38.920
They've got this cool like tile sort of celebration of history on their website.


00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.880
And they tell you that it will be April 19 to 27.


00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.800
There's a small problem with that, though.


00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.320
How actionable is it if I want to go to the conference,


00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.320
and I want to go see the main talks.


00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.820
When do I book my travel?


00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.120
- Yeah, the whole thing.


00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.620
- It's awesome, right?


00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.920
I can come to the tutorials


00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.880
and do the week of sprints after.


00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.880
I don't know, that's a lot.


00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.340
And so I reached out to Twitter


00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.300
and Marietta says,


00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.420
"Tutorials are on Wednesdays and Thursdays.


00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.140
Talks, keynotes, expo halls are Friday to Sunday.


00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.680
And from Monday onwards, those are the spreads."


00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.060
Perfect, perfect.


00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.140
So yesterday while I was sitting,


00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.480
getting studded winter tires put on my car


00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.260
so I can go to the mountains and not die.


00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.400
I decided to go ahead and book my travel


00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.420
and I'm gonna go to the conference.


00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.960
We talked about maybe we'll go, maybe not.


00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.220
I'm gonna go for a whole week.


00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.200
I'm gonna show up on Thursday


00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.480
and leave on the next Thursday.


00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.560
Maybe be part of the sprints


00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.200
but definitely do a ton of podcasting while I'm there


00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.520
and try to just make it like a,


00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.800
other people will be spreading out code,


00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.560
I'm gonna be sprinting on podcast episodes.


00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.360
- I gotta decide what I'm gonna do.


00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.320
I haven't decided yet.


00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.320
I'll probably go.


00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.880
- Flights are still pretty cheap right now.


00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.760
They might be, like hotels and stuff, I think,


00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.180
There are really a lot of variations.


00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.200
Like there was, I was like,


00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.580
oh, maybe I'll save the Hilton $3,300.


00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.920
Like, yeah, maybe I won't save the Hilton, what else?


00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.140
So I think people are starting to book it out.


00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:54.980
- Okay, yeah.


00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.060
- Anyway, thank you Marietta for sharing that information.


00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.440
It makes it much easier for us to plan


00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.080
about participating or even just watching PyCon online.


00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.920
- Yeah, cool.


00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.380
- Yeah, all right.


00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.920
Quick shout out to GeForce Now.


00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.320
Have you heard of GeForce Now?


00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.160
- No.


00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.680
- So my daughter's really into gaming these days.


00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.720
plays a bunch of horse riding games and Minecraft and playing at the zoo.


00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:25.160
There's a cool Jurassic Park thing that's like a Sims but for dinosaurs.


00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.180
Most of these games run on Windows and we have an Alienware computer,


00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.160
but it's all set up for my Sim racing.


00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.920
It's hard to play games on that don't involve a steering wheel.


00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.280
She's like, "How can I play these games on my PC?"


00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.320
I'm like, "Oh, my Mac."


00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.880
She has a MacBook Air.


00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.880
I'm like, "Oh, I don't know."


00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.180
She's like, "How could I play if I'm not at home


00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.220
"and I can stream?"


00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.860
So we try out GeForce Now.


00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.260
Basically, they'll give you a high-end Windows computer


00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.300
and like a GeForce 3080,


00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.700
and it just streams like Netflix to your PC.


00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.500
And it is super low latency.


00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.420
I mean, it's like you're really just playing it there,


00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.260
but you're not.


00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.640
It's pretty awesome.


00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:06.380
- Oh, so you can play a game on a remote computer then?


00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.460
- Yeah, or I mean, you can play it on your iPad,


00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.100
or you can play it on your iPhone or Android,


00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.300
or on your Mac or whatever,


00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.380
and they've got a completely 100% free tier,


00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.140
so it's pretty nuts.


00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:17.980
We should check that out.


00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.040
Anyway, that was a cool techno experience.


00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.260
Two new YouTube videos I've released.


00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.960
One five days ago, one five hours ago.


00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.300
How about that for timing?


00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.140
- Nice.


00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.900
- So as part of this sort of social media,


00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.860
Twitter madness, and various other things,


00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.920
I've been thinking about this for a while.


00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.100
Anyway, I'm like, all right,


00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.380
I really want to try to build up my presence


00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.500
on other areas that are not just Twitter.


00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.640
And so like, well, YouTube might be one fun place


00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.920
to sort of build up a community.


00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.640
So I'm starting to add more videos there, right?


00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.920
So like I've done in the past couple of weeks,


00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.880
I've done four videos,


00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.640
but the last two is a walrus meets a Python, which is fun.


00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.160
That's about the walrus operator.


00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.480
And then the one that came out today is Python GC settings,


00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.760
which shows some insane stuff you can do


00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.000
to tweak the GC a little bit


00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.240
and get crazy better performance.


00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.080
- Nice.


00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.960
The GC being the garbage collector, right?


00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.280
- Yes, not reference counting,


00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.800
which does like 99.9% of Python memory.


00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.760
a 0.1% or the 0.1%, whatever's left over,


00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.280
like that actually, you often can turn that down


00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.960
'cause you don't really have cycles that much that get lost


00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.200
and it turns out to have some pretty interesting effects.


00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.360
We think we covered, was it Instagram, I think?


00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.560
I think they wrote an article called


00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.720
Dismissing the Garbage Collector


00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.840
where they literally turned it off in production.


00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.240
It was either that or I can't remember


00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.780
which company did it, but this is kind of like a,


00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.520
well, let's don't be so aggressive like that,


00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.160
but kind of, you know, and it's pretty, yeah.


00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.000
- Nice.


00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.080
- People can check those out.


00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.680
- Yeah, so one of the things that I,


00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.160
the only extra I've got is I really liked this article


00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.480
from Simon Willison about what to blog about.


00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.720
So a lot of, so people are,


00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.560
you have a presence somewhere other than Twitter,


00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.220
like maybe write, start writing your blog more.


00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.680
And I like this what to blog about.


00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.100
He goes through a couple things.


00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.160
One of the things is the today I learned.


00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.760
And I, you know, I actually,


00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.640
At first, when I first encountered the TIL thing,


00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.200
at first it was like, why do you need that?


00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.620
Can't you just like, just write what you learned anyway?


00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.560
But a lot of people have this paralysis of,


00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.080
if I write how to do something,


00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.680
people are gonna think it's a tutorial


00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.440
and I don't know how to do everything with this tool.


00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.180
I just learned this little thing of how to do fix my thing.


00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:30.180
So the TIL at least is a tag that people will know,


00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.440
it's not a full tutorial,


00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.400
it's just a little snippet of somebody


00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:40.240
learned about this thing and I think this is a great way to go about writing it. It can be short


00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.200
and simple or it can be longer. Plus also if you build up a lot of these around a topic it might


00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:51.760
turn into a tutorial later. So now that you've learned a ton you can write a blog or longer blog


00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.640
post about it. I also just want to tell people that it doesn't have to be a like a full tutorial.


00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.160
You don't have to compete with real Python or other places. You can just do a short thing you


00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.720
learned about it doesn't have to be this. Okay the other thing you talked about was projects is to


00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:13.760
write about projects that you've done and I think that's a great idea and but I also want to


00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.720
make sure that people understand also the things you're working on right as you're building stuff.


00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:25.040
This can be part of the TIL but it could just be this is the fate and it's also another way to


00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.080
limit the scope like color in the terminal. I don't want to write about all of color in the


00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.160
the terminal, but maybe I could write about the just fixing this one bug or


00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.060
this one feature request, what I went through to figure out how to figure out


00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:42.440
how to use Colorama and and then how do I detect whether it's a TTY terminal or


00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.920
not, things like that. That could be a decent article just to write about that.


00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:51.800
And so I think these are great tips for unblocking yourself. The


00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.600
other thing I want to tell people about is if you've covered it, you've


00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.600
learned it from somebody else's blog already, but it didn't quite meet your needs and you


00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:07.640
looked at other places, that means that there is a tutorial out there that's missing, and


00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.420
it's the one that kind of fits your brain.


00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:15.700
You can rewrite something that is similar to what other people have written about and


00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.880
just write it in a different way that fits you better, and that'll maybe fit other people


00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.480
better too, so there's nothing wrong with that.


00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.000
It doesn't have to be completely unique.


00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
>> Yeah, absolutely.


00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
It definitely doesn't.


00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
I like it.


00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.880
>> Yeah, I came out there says,


00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.800
TILs are also handy to reread from time to time


00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.520
and remind yourself of things you've figured out and forgotten.


00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.780
You can see the search engines with stuff that you knew,


00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.780
and then when you forget it, you can find it again.


00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.760
>> That's how I started blogging and I didn't call it TIL.


00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.520
I had a blog nobody was reading and I would just throw up


00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.760
stuff like commands that I looked up,


00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.440
like commands from a tool.


00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.760
I always forget how to change


00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.960
my commit message after I've committed too fast.


00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.720
So throwing up a little post about Git commit amend would be fine.


00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.660
>> Yeah, absolutely. All right.


00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.860
Well, this has been a fun episode,


00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.460
but it's still good sometimes to just take a moment and relax.


00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.220
>> Yeah.


00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.560
>> I mean, I took my dog for a walk in the woods during sunrise,


00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.900
it was like this fog.


00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.080
For some people, getting out in nature is amazing.


00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.320
But as software developers,


00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:22.240
a lot of times you want to get close to the code or close to the heart of technology.


00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.440
What speaks heart of techno analogy more than the server?


00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.560
- This is crazy, man.


00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.160
- Yeah, so here's a thing you can play.


00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.800
It's on YouTube, I'll show you in a second.


00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.040
And it says pure relaxation, server sound.


00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.240
So we can come over here and it actually has tracks.


00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.920
So like it starts with desktop in the Draldrum,


00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.480
entering the engine room, the far side of the cloud.


00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.960
I find co-location ventilation to be especially relaxing.


00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.240
Facing the cloud.


00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.800
And finally spacewalk.


00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.320
So I just want to play a little bit of this for people, right?


00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.360
I think, I think they're going to enjoy it.


00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:56.880
Maybe.


00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:04.320
It's amazing.


00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:04.520
Right.


00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.620
So relaxing.


00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.320
So, anyway,


00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.960
you shared it with me before we started though.


00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.040
And I got to say it's hilarious.


00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.560
So I'm going to go check this out.


00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:18.280
I mean, keep in mind, a lot of people have to wear like big earmuffs,


00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.660
sound protection to go in this room.


00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.500
So it might be the opposite of relaxing, but you'll see.


00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.000
You'll see.


00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.860
Okay, cool.


00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.500
Nice fight.


00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:25.900
All right.


00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.420
Yeah.


00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:26.780
Thanks.


00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.380
Just here to help people be more productive, you know, maybe not with this though.


00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:36.220
Well, in some of these people that used to be around the, all these server farms are now working from home and they might miss that sound.


00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.580
So that's true.


00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.740
Roman out there points out that the scary part is actually if the server room is quiet,


00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:46.100
why is it quiet?


00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:46.860
This is not good.


00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.420
Yeah.


00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.420
Um, all right.


00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:48.860
All right.


00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.940
Well, thanks a lot for as always.


00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:55.180
And thank you everybody for watching and showing up and listening.


00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.140
We love you.


00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.580
And thanks, everyone.


00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.580
It's been an awesome six years and we'll keep going.


00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:00.940
Yeah. Bye bye.
