00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.360
This is episode 380, recorded on April 23rd, 2023.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.720
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.840
And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.040
And this episode is brought to you by us.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.560
Join the show live, pythonbytes.fm/live.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.960
Usually Tuesdays at 10am Pacific Time now.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.960
And you see all the older versions there if you want the video as well.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.480
And finally, Brian, a bunch of people are signing up for the newsletter that you're

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.520
sending out about things from the show every week.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.560
So that's awesome.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.760
People can just visit pythonbytes.fm, click on newsletter right in the middle of the top

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.680
of the screen and put in their email.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.840
We will treat it kindly, but then we will email you stuff that we're up to, which we'd

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.480
love to do.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.680
So we appreciate that.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.120
And, you know, I really want to just like maybe focus on that kind of stuff.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.760
Brian, what do you think?

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.840
Let's focus, man.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.560
Let's focus.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.760
Speaking of focus, we've got NumFocus.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.280
So NumFocus is a, you know, actually, I probably should have done a little more research.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.840
NumFocus is a collection of different resources.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.160
And let's just take a look at the about of NumFocus.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.360
So NumFocus has a mission of promoting open practices in research data and scientific

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.920
computing.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.320
There's a lot of information on the NumFocus site.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.600
You can check it out.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.360
But if you take a look at the projects that are involved, this is crazy.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.880
So the projects, sponsored projects, there's a lot of our favorites like NumPy, Pandas,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.880
Jupyter, SciPy.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.480
So many things are involved with NumFocus and collaborate with NumFocus.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.120
And I'm not, like I said, we should have had Pamphil on to talk about it a little bit.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.720
But Pamphil let us know something that's going on with the NumFocus group.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.520
And it's a little, there's some changes going on.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.120
So this was suggested by Pamphil Roy, who's in the audience right now.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.240
So thanks for showing up.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.200
So this was an article by Paul Ivanov called NumFocus Concerns.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.800
And we'll link to it in the show notes, of course.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.000
But there has been some, there's some shakeup going on in NumFocus a little bit.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.640
There's been some problems in the past with NumFocus being able to meet the expectations

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.560
of some of the projects within the NumFocus banner.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.600
And there was a town hall meeting in February announcing that there's a new direction.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.280
And it caught a lot of people by surprise.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.480
So I'm trying to highlight it here as well, so people know about it.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.080
There have, there's really, I kind of want to point people to this article and just say

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.840
that there's some things changing.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.320
There's apparently in the past, there was some lack of transparency of how the board

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.280
was selected.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.760
So they're trying to make that a little bit more transparent.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.680
There is an initiated effort to elect open board seats to try to get more people on the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.520
board and some proposed changes to the governance structure.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.920
And then around some of these issues, there's also some of the projects within NumFocus

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.240
are pursuing alternative venues for fiscal sponsorship.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.640
So getting money in other ways.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.400
So a lot of information here.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:03.120
I thought it was interesting, some of the different alternatives to, there's like open

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.080
source collective or some of the ways to get money.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.720
There's different, I mean, money is important to try to get some of the projects, some people

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.360
working on it.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.280
So if you'd like to get more involved or just know, have more information about what's going

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.120
on with NumFocus, this is a really great write up.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.720
So thanks for passing this along.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.040
Excellent.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.280
I, you know, NumFocus is interesting.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.840
It's really one of the bigger ways that funds Python open source and outside of Python as

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.240
well, but there's not many other organizations like that.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.720
So keeping it, keeping it healthy is definitely important.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.520
Yeah.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.400
I'm glad it's, it got, there's some attention drawn, being drawn to it before it, you know,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.360
kind of implodes.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.720
So I don't think it will.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.120
I think we'll see NumFocus for quite a while.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.600
So definitely.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.920
All right.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.840
Speaking of shining a little bit of light on something, let's talk about leaping.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.440
Python, this, right, this, this pytest project should be one that you're focusing on, but

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.400
I beat you to it.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.520
So here we go.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.880
Have you heard of this leaping?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.520
I have not.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.640
Okay.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.760
Well, it's because the description is so, wait, no, there's no description.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.600
This is a small project that does, it's got 238 stars.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.840
So it's not a huge thing, but I want to give it a bit of a shout out because I think this

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.680
is cool and I would love to hear your take, right?

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:40.800
So leaping is a pytest debugger, simple, fast, lightweight for Python tests, and it traces

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.840
the execution of your code and then allows you, so you run a test session, you know,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.520
pytest dot whatever.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:56.880
And then you can retroactively ask questions about how your pytest session went using natural

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.360
language.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.960
Okay.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.200
Okay.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.040
So like, well, what would you possibly ask it?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.840
So it does this by keeping track of the variable changes at variables changing over time and

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.200
other sources of non-determinism within your code.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.480
So you would just say pytest dash dash leaping.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.240
If you install that, then it runs.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.000
You can ask questions like, why am I not hitting this function?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.400
Why was this variable set to this value?

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.120
What is the value of a variable at this point?

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.120
And what changes can I make to my code to make this test pass even stuff like that?

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.720
I see this is pretty neat.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.280
You know, I haven't, don't have any experience with it, but it sounds, sounds pretty creative.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.800
It says it's based on both Ollama and GPT-4.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.800
You can pick which model you would like.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.640
And those are both pretty powerful.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.880
So.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.800
Why leaping?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.840
Leaping llamas?

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.160
I don't know.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.640
That's well, typically llamas do leap a lot.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.480
No, I don't think they do actually.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.280
Maybe a little bit.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.200
Okay.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.400
I don't know.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.200
I can't tell you why.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:16.080
Maybe I think it might come from a larger project that here, but I don't really know.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.480
Well, I'll play with it and maybe we could get somebody on to tell us or I'll ask somebody

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.120
why leaping.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.480
Anyway, I thought that was kind of interesting.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.080
So I want to turn the light off.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.400
Thanks for giving me some homework to work on.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.040
Yes, of course.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.000
Last one we gave, was it Mike Fiedler we gave homework this time?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.040
I'm giving you homework.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.600
Yeah.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.120
Haven't heard back from Mike though.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.160
What's up, Mike?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.320
Yeah.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.440
Where's that article, man?

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.680
Yeah.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.200
Over to you.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.280
So, okay.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.000
So I've got an extras, extras, extra section because I kind of got it down a rabbit hole.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.640
So on the last discussion of this NumFocus concerns, I was looking at,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:11.920
anyway, one of the other topics that Penfield passed over is that there's a 2024 Developer

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.560
Summit going on.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.440
So I'll just get started.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.040
2024 Developer Summit happening in Seattle, June 3rd to 5th.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.640
This is a invite only thing.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.080
So I'm just announcing it because it's cool.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.520
Don't try to sign up because you can't, but that's okay.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.800
It's still neat that we have one of the reasons why I wanted to bring it up is not to try

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:39.760
to promote it, but to say, with like some of the, what is it, XZ or something that last,

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.000
that bug that went by recently.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.920
X-P-V-X, I can't remember.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.960
X-Z.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.560
Near downfall of all the internet.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.600
Well, one of the problems was this discussion that people in a project don't talk to each

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.240
other that much.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.760
And there's a lot of times where you can't really get away from that.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.600
But the Scientific Python Developer Summit is one place where a lot of the people from

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.320
these Python scientific projects get together.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.840
And it's pretty neat.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.840
Last year was the first, and they did a whole bunch of cool things last year, including

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.640
some, yeah, a bunch of planning implemented.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.200
They had a working group on sparse arrays.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.960
A bunch of specs were worked on and even some pytest stuff.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.600
So community building, lots of great resources to try to get some of these core things together.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.560
And even some pytest plugins, which is pretty neat.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.600
And so one of the things here was like another pytest plugin.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.520
I'm like, cool, what's that do?

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.800
So popped over, this is pytest Regex.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:58.480
And well, if you've got a large, especially parameterized, but really a large pytest code

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.880
test code base, sometimes you've got like quite a few tests coming in.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.560
And how do you specify?

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.480
One of the ways you can pick out a subset of tests is to use the dash k option to say,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.600
hey, I just want to use something that has tests like underscore 3D in it to try to get

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.080
those, but that might still be a long list.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.800
And what this is, is it has the ability and there is some logic in the dash k.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.720
So if you don't know about the logic of the dash k, definitely read my book or take my

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.220
course.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:36.080
But the it isn't as powerful as a regular expression, but with this plugin, you can

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.280
use a regular expression to select the test names, which is kind of awesome.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.600
I think it's kind of awesome.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.160
It's also kind of scary to think of using regular expressions in test selection.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.520
>> You're going to need to write a test for your command line.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.120
>> Yeah.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.520
Okay.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.560
So, pytest Regex is one of my extra extras.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:05.840
The next one on the list is this write up called by J. Carlos Roldan, I think.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.040
My latest today I learned about Python.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:15.360
And a lot of these are fun, but the thing that I wanted to highlight, I guess I always

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.960
just forget that underscores are a thing for long numbers and it's very handy for constants.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.600
Okay.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.120
The thing that I thought was neat was this, what was it?

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.280
There was an example of a decorator with just a class.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.040
You don't have to import anything or decorator stuff.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.360
If you just have a class with a dunder init and a dunder call, you can implement your

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.080
own decorator.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.240
And I didn't realize that it was that easy.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.720
So, kind of a cool, small example.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.920
All right.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.200
Next up on our extras and last is Ruff got a little faster.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:12:01.760
So, version 0.4.0 of Ruff is supposedly greater than two times faster, which is 20 to 40%

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.240
speed up.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.040
>> Wow.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.160
>> So, these are pretty neat numbers.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.240
So, it was already pretty zippy already.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.760
So, it's pretty cool.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.000
Anyway, those are my extras.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.280
>> Yeah, very cool.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.440
That was 0.4.0, yeah?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.080
>> Yeah.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.960
>> Okay.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.320
I think that's not out yet, but it's going to be or something.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:20.880
That's awesome.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.720
I just did my pipx upgrade all, which is a really cool command.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.720
Just says go find all the things that uses Python command line tools and upgrade them.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.160
I got 1.3.0.1.37, but very cool.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.720
All right.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.720
Well, that's a lot of extra.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.220
>> All right.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.320
>> Well, yeah.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.160
So, not the end of extra, I'm thinking, but a lot of extra.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.880
>> Yeah.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.200
>> So, let's talk about PyPI and packages.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.480
Now, I've covered this a fair number of times where we've talked about, oh, there's somebody

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.320
uploading some horrible package that if you install it, bad thing happen.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.000
Bad things happen.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.280
But this has nothing to do with that.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.400
Not directly, anyway.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.720
Even though it might sound like it.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.080
PyPI has completed its first security audit.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.540
Okay.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:22.720
So, this is an article, I believe by, no, Dustin Ingram, and says, who's part of the

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:29.360
Python Packaging Group Authority, says, we're proud to announce that PyPI has completed

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.320
its first ever external security audit.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.080
The work was funded in partnership with the Open Technology Fund.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.840
And they've done previous security stuff there.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:47.680
And they selected TrailerBits, which is a very well-known security pen testing company,

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.040
to work on it.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.920
And they spent, so if you've ever thought, like, should I have a security audit done

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.960
on my project?

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.600
Maybe.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:03.600
But TrailerBits spent 10 engineering weeks of effort going, trying to break into the

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.360
systems and break them and looking at the code and making sure everything is good.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.680
That's a lot of, I don't know what that costs, but that can't be cheap.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.920
So, it's really cool that that was funded to make that happen.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.880
The other important part is the scope.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.640
So, this has to do specifically with what's called warehouse, which is when you go to

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:33.840
pypi.org, that thing, that website, the APIs, the stuff behind the scenes that people create

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.120
accounts at, that they upload packages to, right?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:43.520
Like, that infrastructure, not PIP, not the packages stored in PIP, but like the infrastructure

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.520
that provides the website and the APIs.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:54.400
As well as something called Cavitage, a custom open source container orchestration framework

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.360
that they created to deploy warehouse, which sounds interesting.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.680
And I know nothing about this, but those are the two things which were done.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.440
And the really nice part, everything's pretty much fine.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.680
They decided that they didn't have any significant problems.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.920
They found 29 different advisories.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.880
14 were informational.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.680
Six were low priority, eight were medium, and zero were high priority issues discovered.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.960
So, that's pretty awesome, right?

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.480
>> That is pretty cool.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.200
>> Yeah.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.720
So, there's multiple articles and details published as follow-up.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.640
So, like all of the stuff that they did there, it's all public and you can check it out if

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.880
you wish, but I feel like that's enough to give people the idea there.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.560
So, thanks, Dustin, for writing that up.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.920
And very good to hear that at least the infrastructure of PyPI is solid.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.520
>> Cavitage sounds like a soup or something.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.240
>> Mm.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.200
>> Had a lovely Cavitage last night for dinner.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.240
>> It does.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.440
All right, well, that's our main items, Brian.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.360
How are you feeling about it?

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.880
Got any more extras in there for us?

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.880
>> I have some personal extras.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:02.880
>> All right, do it.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.520
>> So, I wanted to shout out or just to highlight some personal extras.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:19.360
So, on the pytest course that I have, the community was based on Slack, mostly trying

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:26.000
to use Slack, but Slack has this 90-day limitation thing on large communities, and it deletes

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.320
stuff.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:34.400
So, I'm going to try out Podia community for the community feature of pytest courses.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:43.120
So, I was just kind of hoping to reach out and say, has anybody tried Podia community

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.800
features and have a community set up on that, and how's it going?

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:58.640
If you have and you have some feedback for me, go ahead and contact me at onmastodon.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.400
I'm @brianokin@fostodon.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.880
Let me know if you have a cool community that I can check out.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.760
That'd be neat.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.160
And if you're interested in joining the pytest community itself, you can, of course, buy

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.160
a course, but you can also, I'm going to try to open it up to other people.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.400
And if when I do make changes, I'll announce it both through our newsletter.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.400
So, become a friend of the show at Python Bytes, or you can sign up for the newsletter

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.000
at Python Test Podcast also.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.160
I'll announce it on both those things.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.360
So, that's it.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.000
Do you have any extras?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.320
>> Excellent.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.320
Yeah, let's see what we got here.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.440
I have some extras, actually, but I got to set it up.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.880
I don't want to spoil the joke.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.120
It almost got the joke out there first.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:45.440
So, the first thing is, recently had a lot of fun hanging out with Cecil Philip and Brian

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:45.760
Clark.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:52.480
Those guys wrote the VS Code course at Talk Python, which is an awesome course.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.640
Check it out at talkpython.fm.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.920
Click on courses, right at the top.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:02.000
But as sort of a follow up to that, we had a VS Code AMA.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.440
And so, I had Brian and Cecil there, but also Luciana, who's been on the show before, and

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.440
Karthik from the Python VS Code team.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:17.360
And we spent 35 minutes and 44 seconds taking questions from the audience and talking about

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.920
features and direction of Python and VS Code.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.640
And that was a lot of fun.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.760
So, people can check that out.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.480
It's on YouTube.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.280
And just, you know, go check it out if they want.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.720
Next, do you G-Unicorn?

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.320
Not Goonicorn, because the icon is a green unicorn.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:40.720
So, G-Unicorn has a CVE, which is not ideal.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:47.760
CVE means there is some problem worth giving a number and a record to.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.720
So, this is CVE-2824-1135.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.040
And it's awaiting analysis.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.840
It seems.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:03.200
But G-Unicorn fails to properly validate transfer encoding headers, leading to HTTP request

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.960
smuggling vulnerabilities.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.760
You don't want smugglers in your web app, do you, Brian?

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.120
No.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:09.620
No.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:15.120
By crafting requests with conflicting transfer encoding headers, attackers can bypass security

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.920
restrictions and access restricted endpoints.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.800
So, I would say maybe you don't want to do that.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.580
Hmm.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.700
Okay.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:31.120
Yeah, it doesn't sound incredibly dangerous, but it is a 7.5.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.600
It is high in the danger level.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.880
So, I guess it depends.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:44.800
To me, it just depends on how are you actually restricting those things and what part of

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.360
G-Unicorn versus what part of your own code is actually checking whether something has

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.800
access to a thing and so on.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.480
So, yeah.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.120
But I want to put that out there because you might want to update your G-Unicorn.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.400
Next up, another announcement.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.640
You had the Sci-Fi one.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:11.440
So, PyCon South Africa, PyCon ZA, is going to be a hybrid event.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.280
And right now, the big news is that the talk submissions are open.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:21.760
They prefer them in person, but they can be given remotely as well or recorded, I believe.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.240
So, you can possibly submit a talk if you're interested.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.280
The main conference is in October.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.720
So, there's that.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.160
And speaking of conferences, this one was sent in by Philip Jones.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:40.240
Brian, what would happen if you had like a stealth conference that invaded some other

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:40.740
conference?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.280
Like a symbiote.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.840
[Laughter]

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.340
Yeah.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.120
So, there's FlaskCon inside PyCon this year.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.960
Okay.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.920
So, on Friday, they will be having FlaskCon 2024.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:07.120
And, you know, the Friday, which is May 17th, at PyCon US, and call for proposals are live.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:14.880
Basically, they give you some ideas of things they might find interesting and so on.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.600
But yeah, there's a whole series of events and introduction from David Lord, who leads

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.920
the Pallets project, which manages Flask among other things.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:31.520
But yeah, there's a whole from 11am till 7pm, maybe till 6pm, depending on what you call

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.280
a conference, series just focused on Flask.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.640
So, I think that's pretty interesting.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.160
I'm most interested to just see how this logistically works out.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.240
But if you're going to be there anyway, that's cool.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.540
Yeah.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.960
Actually, it's kind of an interesting idea.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.440
It's on Friday, which I'm normally like, you know, going to other talks and other stuff

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.080
on Fridays.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.600
And I'd be curious to see some other piggyback things.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:02.880
Because at PyCon, there's the tutorial section before, and then there's the sprints after.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.520
But there's also like, there's a lot less people in there.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:14.080
So, there might be opportunities to do some other piggyback sub-conferences before or

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.520
after as well in the future.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.640
Yeah.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.140
Interesting.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.400
Absolutely.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.520
All right.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.760
Are you ready to close this out with a debugging joke?

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.860
Yeah, sure.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.240
Okay, we're going to do a little role playing here.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.840
So, this is a conversation.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.160
You want to be the developer or you want to be the person that's curious about how

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.200
developers work it out?

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.800
I'll be the developer.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.720
Okay, you do the green bubble.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:44.080
So, here's a text exchange between somebody who's sitting next to a software developer

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.680
on a train or something like that.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.400
And then texting with their developer friend, go make this make sense.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:48.720
Right?

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.200
Okay, so here's the non-developer.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.480
Is it common for software engineers to take out their laptops on the train only to stare

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.320
at them without doing anything?

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.000
Well, yes.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.680
Legally, you have to or you lose your license as a software engineer.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:10.000
Seriously, he just shut his laptop, opened it back up, pressed a button and resumed staring

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.320
at it.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.520
Oh, yeah.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.600
And now he's browsing his phone while staring.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.200
It's called debugging.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.600
You stare at the code until it works again.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.000
Why do you guys get paid so much?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.960
Pretty good, right?

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.460
Yeah.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.760
Well, it's yeah.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.040
And it's further than that.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.240
I mean, after staring at it for a while, I often bring in other people to stare at it

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:32.740
with me.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.440
Can we just stare at this together for a while?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.840
Because my staring is ineffective.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.120
It's called cold reviews.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.640
Exactly.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.280
Sometimes AI will also stare at it with you.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.840
It can also propose new ways to break it.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.040
Yes, that's right.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:49.540
Yeah.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.080
All right.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:58.400
Well, well, if I had if I had pytest leaping, I could just ask it why it's not working.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.040
Exactly.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.000
Come on.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.760
Leap into action.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.720
What's happening here?

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.360
>> All right. Well, thanks for being here, Brian.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.480
Thank you to everyone for listening. Bye.
