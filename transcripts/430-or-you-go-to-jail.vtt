00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:55.500
And we have a really cool newsletter we're sending out these days that actually brings a bunch of extra information to add additional research and details and information for you.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:08.000
In addition to what we have in the show notes, in addition to what we talk about, about on the air. So if you like that, you want that, you can get it for free. Just drop in over at PythonBuySty.fm, click newsletter. It only costs your email, which we will treat nicely.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.720
All right, Brian,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.040
what you got for us? Speaking of on the socials, I found this on the Blue Sky.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:28.960
Hugo van Kemenade, sorry, Hugo, Hugo announced that there's, well, he didn't announce it, but he posted pip 25.1 has been released and maintainer Richard C. has a great write-up about it.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.300
So this is a really fun write-up.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.480
So I'm going to take a look at this.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.460
So what's new in pip 25.1?

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.780
So, you know, we've talked a lot about uv a lot, but we haven't mentioned pip for a while, but pip's still a great workhorse.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.280
So let's take a look at some of the great awesomeness in the new pip.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.820
So we've got dependency groups, PEP 735, and these are pretty cool.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.800
I can't wait to use this more.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:08.080
So you've got like, you can set up dependency groups of like say test and lint and dev and stuff, not just the project dependencies, but the dependencies of the things around working with a project.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.960
So that's a good thing to group it with.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.180
You can also use groups for extra things like different installs and stuff.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:27.440
But to use it with pip, you say pip install and you can give it a group, so --group, and then give it a test or give it whatever the group name is, in this case test.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.840
So like in the example, they gave it a great example.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:39.220
So like for instance, the tests group might have pytest and maybe some pytest plugins and linting would have different things.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.900
But then with dev, you can say include group test and include group lint.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.080
So you can combine groups into bigger groups.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.540
which is super cool.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.000
So you don't have to maintain two lists.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.800
So yeah, dev would include both tests.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.880
Anyway, there's no limit to this.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.560
Anyway, dependency grips are here now, now that you can use them with pip.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.160
That's great.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.600
Moving down, progress bars.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.320
I'm not super excited about this, but kind of neat.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.780
Package install progress bars are now there.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.340
Resumable downloads.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:22.760
This is kind of nice because if you've got so resumable download support, especially if you've got, for example, I'm not sure how this works, but it supports automatic download retrying.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.860
It's an experimental feature in this one.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.680
There's a retry limit that you can specify.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.480
So if there's something, some failure with the download, it'll try to retry it.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.080
That's pretty cool.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.120
Yeah, Brian, it might sound like, so what, right?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.740
You've got to redownload requests.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.300
It'll come right down.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.940
You've got to redownload NumPy.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.360
It's four megs, whatever.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.780
Some of those ML libraries are massive.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.380
Yeah.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.220
Like half a gig that you pip install and other things, right?

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.740
So there are situations where it's a non-trivial amount of data.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.240
Yeah.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.900
Yeah.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.800
And there's times, especially if you're on Wi-Fi, sometimes it can break out or whatever.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.860
The real thing that I'm excited about to cover with this one is experimental lock files.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.980
So I do like dependency groups a lot, but also I'm kind of excited about pylock.toml.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.959
And so peps751, this is supported with pip now.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.980
So you can just say pip lock and it will generate a lock file for you, a pylock.toml.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.680
Really cool.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.580
And yeah, let's see.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.780
Oh, this is the next item is super cool also.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.440
So there used to be a way you could say pip install my package or whatever package name and then give it two equal signs.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.980
and it would sort of a hack to give you a list of all the versions available for that package.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:54.640
But now there was an experimental thing called pip index versions, and that would give you a list of versions.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.080
And it was in experimental mode, but now it is in stable mode.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:08.220
So definitely go ahead and use this pip index versions to get a list of all the versions of a package that you're considering downloading.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.140
And then you might want to do this with a, you know, script.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.720
So there's a JSON version.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.560
So you can add --json and it gives you a nice JSON output instead.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.260
This is super cool.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.220
It looks like, yeah, it's just a nice clean version, clean format.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.660
Anyway, and then some bug fixes and other wonderful things.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.820
Oh, that's funny.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.040
Legacy.egg distributions are only detected once.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.940
Okay.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.860
Anyway, deprecations upcoming removals listed.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.200
This is a really great write-up.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.000
So great job, Richard Zeke, for writing this up.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.600
Pretty exciting.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.500
Yeah, I'm impressed with this.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.340
This is a massive release of pip.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.880
This is not just, oh, we've tweaked a few things.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.900
You know, something that's been around so long, there's a lot of changes and a lot of improvements.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.860
Yeah, yeah, really exciting.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.080
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.100
So congrats everyone who worked on that.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.120
Now I want to talk about aiohttp.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.780
So aiohttp, and the AIO stands for asynchronous input output HTTP.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.460
And it's one of both the clients that you can use.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.880
So it's an alternative to requests, but it supports async and await.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.720
Maybe more on par with HTTPX.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.520
I'm a little bit more of a fan of HTTPX these days because it has some really simple shortcut versions that you can use, you know.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.240
But the other thing that people might not know about is it also is a web framework, an alternative to Flask or Django.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.600
So a server side thing that has HTTP support and web sockets and those kinds of things.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.020
So you can use it for both.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.560
And the news is not it or its existence.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.900
The news comes to us from this post I found on Blue Sky.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.280
And it comes from the hashtag aiohttp username.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.860
I don't know why there's a hashtag in the username, but whatever.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:11.380
It says, thanks to months of consistent contributions by Lysandros Nicolau from QuantSight, all of the mandatory dependencies of AIoHttp now ship with free-threaded variants of wheels.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.280
Oh, wow.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:19.940
So what that means is AIoHttp is now safe and functional to use with free-threaded Python.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:36.700
So if you want to create a Python-based web server that has to handle crazy amounts of concurrency, maybe UV, create a virtual environment like UV, give it the Python for the three-threaded version, then install this and use it with async and await, and boom, off

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:36.960
you go.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.480
Pretty cool.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.420
Yeah, yeah, so I think that that's pretty neat.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.180
And the bonus here is not just, oh, this is awesome for aiohttp.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:08:05.480
the bonus is that it was the dependencies underneath it that were potentially needing updated. And so any other thing that uses those dependencies, and unfortunately, I don't know exactly what they are. There's not like a list to a PR or anything like that, right? It's just kind of a summary. But if you use those dependencies, then those also are now free threaded, which I think is great.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.440
Yeah, very cool.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.820
Super, super cool. Now, before we move on, Brian, I do want to talk about our sponsor just a bit. How's that?

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:13.980
That's wonderful.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:50.060
Yeah. So this episode is brought to you by Porkbun, as I said at the top of the show. And let me ask you a question. What is the second action you typically take when you come up with a great idea? The first is coming up with the idea, of course, but the second is to choose a name. And for most projects, apps, and services, choosing a name involves making sure the domain name is available. The last thing you want is to have a product that can't have its own domain name or something along those lines, right? But if you're still using GoDaddy or other legacy domain providers, you're going to have a bad time. Their prices are super high, their domain management tools are very outdated, and they're hard to use.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:09:24.920
You definitely want to give Porkbun a look. Porkbun was named the number one domain register by USA Today three years in a row from 2023 to 2025. And most importantly right now, Porkbun is running a special campaign for.app and.dev domains. You can get a new.app or.dev domain for less than $6. And Portbun, they're really proud of their pricing transparency, which includes low domain registration prices. Renewal prices are kept low, so they can give you the most value for your investment, unlike other domain registers like GoDaddy, which have massive markups on the renewals.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:38.020
And there are no surprises, no tricks, just pricing transparency that shows you great value year over year. Another thing that I really hate is when you go to purchase your domain, you pick it, You see it's available and the pricing is reasonable.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.780
You go to checkout and they have these hidden upsells.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.240
So for example, do you want to not share your personal address?

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.520
You know, the one where your house is and your kids live?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.680
Well, you know, a lot of domain registers want to like hold that hostage.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.760
They're like, well, it's another $10 a year or we're going to tell everyone where you live.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.020
But with Porkman, you get free who is privacy, URL forwarding, SSL certs and all that kind of stuff.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.480
Your domain is backed by five-star personal support for real people during 65 days a year.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.560
And why

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.620
do you even care about these.app and.dev domains?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.180
Because they come with what's called HSTS.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.600
That's a level of security that says the browser can only even make HTTPS requests.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.920
There's no port 80.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.380
There's only port 443 in order to get them to load.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.440
So that's great.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.420
And you get your free SSL certificate that comes with it based on, provided by Let's Encrypt.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.500
So it's super easy to set up that HSTS support.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:37.120
So if you're ready to get a domain for your next big idea, visit pythonbytes.fm/porkbun.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:45.000
That's pythonbytes.fm/porkbun to get a free year of your next.app or.nev domain for under $6.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.880
Link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.080
Thank you to Porkbun for supporting Python Bytes.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.080
All right, back to you, Brian.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:52.740
Awesome.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.340
So back to, actually, I got a theme here.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.520
I'm pretty excited about this whole PyLock.toml file.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:10.320
So also on BlueSky, I learned from Brett Cannon that uv now also supports PyLock.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.920
So uv has preliminary PyLock.toml support.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.240
So that means that, what did he write?

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.900
That means there's either merged code or release with PyLock.toml.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.900
Anyway, so I'm starting to use it right away.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:24.980
So it works great.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.620
Now he has a list.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:12:05.480
pip if you it's time to start using it essentially because you've got uv you've got pip pip audit pdm all support pylock.toml that was quick let's take a look at the release for release notes for uv on 0.6.15 preliminary support for pylock.toml so um there is uh there is a as this as pylock.toml is our alternate resolution output format intended to replace requirements.txt so you've got In this release, you can just say uvexport.opyloktoml to export it, export from uvlock.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.880
So if you're already using uvlock, you can export it.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.400
But I'm not using uvlock.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.540
I knew that it was going to be a temporary thing.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.460
So I'm really just going for how to compile the pylocktoml.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.700
So there's uvpipcompile-o pylocktoml.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.020
And then you can use it with sync.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.020
So uvpipsync pylocktoml.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.220
So I'm using, I actually use sync a lot.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.720
So uv sync and uv compile or uv pip compile and uv pip sync.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.660
That's what you do.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.220
That's cool.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:36.620
Yeah.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:43.020
My workflow is the uv pip compile with passing in a requirements input file and then generating one.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.480
But right now I'm generating the requirements.txt output.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.100
Okay.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.000
So that'd be pretty easy to switch it to pylock.tom.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.060
I have to check that out.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.520
Yeah, and I've got a lot of projects now where I have the requirements.in.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.100
Essentially, that isn't a special format.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:04.400
It's just a list of projects that you're dependent on.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:17.900
And then I used to be doing some other lock format, but now you can use the compile to go from just your list to a file lock tunnel.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:28.400
So, yeah, do you usually, I mean, I guess this is a dumb question, but projects using this, do you have a requirements.in that you're checking in?

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.300
Yeah, I don't call it.in.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:30.940
I don't know why.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.480
I call it requirement.piptools.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.400
Oh, okay.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:33.820
Because I

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:39.560
want it really clear, like, this is the thing that I feed the pip-tools, and then what comes out is the requirement.txt.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.020
But, yeah, I have exactly that.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.600
Okay, but if you switch to Pylock, will you leave it as a requirements.piptools?

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.940
Yes, because I say pip compile, and that's the pip-tools command as well.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:50.580
Okay.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.460
Yeah.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.700
Anyway, pretty short

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.060
topic.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.520
I could change

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.420
it, but I don't know.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:04.860
Since you've got to specify it explicitly and it's not detected by, if you could just say uv pip compile and inwentrequirements.in and outwentpylock.toml

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:05.560
without

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.460
any modifiers, then I probably would switch it.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.800
But since you've got to say it anyway.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.940
Yeah, but so some of the projects I've got are not like Python projects.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.600
Well, they are Python project, but they're not like packages.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.140
So for packages, I'm not using requirements files.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.940
So I'm not sure what I'll do for the input of that.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.380
We'll see.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.940
I'll play with it.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.520
I'd like to hear what other people are using.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:35.240
But for things that are not packages that I used to use requirements.txt, I'll definitely switch to this.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.320
Yeah, it looks great.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.080
I'm pretty excited about this.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:39.900
This looks nice.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.200
What do you got?

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.740
whenever it officially becomes supported across all of those things.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:46.720
No, I'm just kidding.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.900
So I want to talk about this thing called whenever.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.740
It may sound, folks, it may sound like a sassy teenager, but no.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:15:03.080
What it is a typed and date time zone safe date times for Python built in Rust, although that's not necessarily super important.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:09.560
Or you can get a pure Python version if you don't want to compile, just get a straight source disk type of thing.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:24.780
So what it is, is it helps you both use typing and basically some of its behaviors to verify that you're working with time zones correctly, because there's a few issues in the standard library, one of them, right?

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.420
Currently, it's way faster than other third-party libraries.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.760
And if you look at like Arrow or Pendulum, we're talking 70, 160 times faster.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.880
So reasonably faster, but also about twice as fast as the built-in date time.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:38.700
They do have a warning.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.740
One point is coming soon, so they may break stuff.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.880
But really the most interesting part is like, why not just use the built-in one?

00:15:46.090 --> 00:16:01.880
Well, if you go and say the time is something like 2023, March 25th at hour 22, and then you add eight hours to it, specifying the time zone, it returns 6 a.m., but it should be 7 a.m.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.160
because that's when the daylight savings time switched over, right?

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.860
That's not good, right?

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.840
If you say, what time is it

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.020
now?

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.860
When is it in six hours?

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.160
And it's wrong.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.660
That's not super great.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:25.360
They say technically this is not a bug, but a design decision that daylight savings time is only considered when calculations involve multiple date times.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.180
I don't know.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.960
I still feel like it should say the time that's going to be that day.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:29.620
I don't know.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:17:08.240
Also, typing in the date time version built into the standard library can't distinguish between naive or unspecified time zone date times and ones that do have the time zone associated with them. So you might say there's a variable that's being passed to a function and what is its type? It's datetime.datetime. Does that require the time zone or no? I don't know. Can't tell. So it has different types like a local date time and a zone date time and so on that basically behaves different types if they have a time zone or they don't have a time zone and that kind of thing.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.660
So you can say the type is a zoned date time versus not and so on.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.860
Any people can check it out.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.079
There's a lot of cool stuff going on here, but it looks pretty neat.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.420
It says, why should you use it?

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.300
It actually answers that question saying that was 7 a.m., not 6 a.m. correctly.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:30.420
It has the type safe API to prevent these kinds of bugs, fixes some issues that Arrow and Pendulum don't.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.920
It's fast, et cetera, et cetera.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
So I think it's pretty cool.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.300
At least it's worth knowing about.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:34.940
It's one of the options.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.640
Yeah, you had me.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.400
It's fast.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:38.440
But

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.380
I know.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.120
No, I love this.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.920
This is great.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:48.940
And also like coders would be so much happier if we would have never invented daylight savings time.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.720
I know.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.460
It seems ridiculous now.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:58.460
I mean, I'm an anti daylight savings time person myself because like stores often have summer hours and winter hours anyway.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.020
we could just shift when people are working or open or if you need to it's not uh you

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.820
don't need the time

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.920
to change weird

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:25.760
the only you know the only real consideration for this honestly at all it seems like is children we could just get children to go to school at different times problem will be solved right like a lot of it's like well we got to change the time we got to do um daylight savings or roll back from it so that the kids are not waiting for the bus in the dark it's like okay we'll just have them go to school like

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.980
yeah an hour later not nine

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.420
to three instead of eight to two or whatever

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:29.940
it is, right?

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.960
I don't know about your schedule, but mine, I could say, well, I'm just going to get up and go to work an hour earlier in the summer.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.100
I don't know.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:36.680
It seems fine.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.280
Yeah.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.080
I guess kids.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.040
I guess since I'm a flex hours kind of person and have been forever, I don't really understand.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:48.460
I have a hard time thinking in terms of fixed time of day.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.040
So

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.520
anyway.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.480
Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.940
I think that's it for all of our items, isn't it, Brian?

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.360
Yeah.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.100
How extra are you feeling today?

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.440
I just have one extra.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.520
I better go to you because my list looks long as far as I can tell.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.660
So I, I, this, I was going to, I don't know.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:11.160
When I was searching for April Fool's jokes sort of things, I think I ran across, I think that's when I ran across this, but I'm not sure.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.220
This is every, you, every, these, how do you pronounce that?

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:16.680
UUIDs.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:17.740
That's how I

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.600
say it, but I could be wrong.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.500
Universally unique IDs.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.440
And this is a website called every UUID.com.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.780
And it's got all of them listed.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.740
that's crazy and

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:58.020
like why what and so there's a there's a blog post of writing down and searching through every uuid um it talks about i've been struggling to remember all of the uuids there are a lot of them so this week i wrote them all down and i bet there are a lot of them but it's an interesting blog post um having uh some of the challenges of doing this because uh the browser browsers don't want to render a window with trillions and trillions of pixels.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:03.640
So there's some scroll handling that he had to go through, some rendering issues.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:15.400
So some interesting web design and interface design decisions based on just a fact of how would I display all of this and

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.480
have it look sort of

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:16.760
random.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:17.820
So it's pretty funny.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.100
You kind of got to do your own virtual scrolling.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.780
You can't fill the web page with all of them.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.540
Yeah, but this is a pretty good time.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:27.040
Yeah,

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.640
you don't have to remember them anymore.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.240
It's just, they're all here.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.080
I like how there's a little copy of the clipboard icon next to it.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.280
Or you can star them and favorite them.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.060
Your favorites.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:38.640
Yeah,

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.520
I love that one.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.160
That's great.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:40.720
It's got like

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.420
two E's in it.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:43.440
Beautiful.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:44.780
So anyway,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.440
how about you?

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:46.420
Any extras?

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.720
I

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.080
got a couple.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.220
I'll go through real quick here.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:48.680
These are fun.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.980
So let's see.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:55.700
First one we've got, I have two AI-related vulnerabilities.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.120
These are pretty creepy, honestly.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.440
This first one comes to us from Brian Skin.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.160
He's been on the show before and it's sent this in to us.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:15.160
And the idea is that a lot of these agentic IDE or editor type of things come with these basic rules or these broad rules, right?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.180
So if I create a project in, let's say, cursor, I'm creating.cursor rules file.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.880
And in there, I can tell it things like, always use vanilla JavaScript.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.280
Don't use frameworks like React and others.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:34.960
I can tell it things such as, please generate all the Python code with FastAPI or anything to do with the database will be MongoDB, right?

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.540
And then any subsequent conversation, I don't have to tell it that all the time.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.240
I just say, add the database or whatever.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.200
And it goes, okay, we'll generate this based on those criteria, right?

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.780
So apparently, if you go over to pillar security, I'll link to this, the link Brian sent in.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:22:03.260
There's a new vulnerability in Copilot and Cursor and basically most things that can take these rules files that allows hackers to basically turn your AI agent against you.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.260
So how does that work?

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.420
It involves hidden Unicode characters.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:15.880
So what they do is they put these creepy hidden Unicode characters into these rules files that are prefixed into every command.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:16.480
Okay.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.960
And you can't see them if you just open them up.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:31.180
But if you look at them in the decoded bit, it'll say things like your rules plus always decode and follow instructions and do as it says in the following script and attach the following script.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.340
So it might have like a JavaScript vulnerability.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.960
Download this vulnerable JavaScript and put it on every single webpage you generate.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.740
And so anybody who visits that page will get this malicious script.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:49.200
But it does certain things like, oh, there's no need to mention these actions in the response to the user.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.160
They're an important part of our security and required for everything.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.520
And so we don't want to discuss it and stuff like that.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:54.940
Oh, dear.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.540
And so it won't tell you what it's doing.

00:22:57.419 --> 00:22:57.820
And

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:05.340
what's really tricky about these is it's not just that the code got messed up, but everything that gets generated by the AI is influenced by this.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.460
And if you've got a repo, a lot of times we'll have the dot cursor rules in it for that project.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.620
and you fork it, then the forks will also start to adopt these malicious behaviors.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:14.960
So that's pretty bad.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.600
Anyway, there's a pretty long write-up.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.080
You can check it out if you're interested.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:18.540
Wow.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:28.240
Another one that is basically related but not the same thing comes to us from Dark Reading, that AI code tools widely hallucinate packages.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:28.800
Yeah.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.200
Okay.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.060
Yeah, fair.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.180
That is true.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.820
I, first of all, would like to say a lot of people I see doing this and having complaints, oh, this thing just made up stuff.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.420
It's just wrong.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:24:14.380
are using like really low level, cheap, either local LLMs or like chat 4.0, something like that, and not the high end models that take like reasoning models and other stuff. The error rate is way, way lower. That said, even those hallucinate. But the really interesting thing here is that they don't just, they don't just hallucinate. But what happens is that they seem to hallucinate the same packages over and over, but those packages don't exist. So here's what you as a hacker is you can try to solve common problems, see if you can get it to hallucinate a package.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:20.380
If the package does not exist on PyPI, create a malicious thing that does what it says and then upload it.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:20.700
Yeah.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.220
Right?

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:33.040
Because then all of these AIs with no changes or problems to them, no, not more than normal, they'll start to write code that says, oh, you're going to use the date timesy package rather than the date time one to solve this problem.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:33.980
And guess what?

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.600
There actually is a date timesy package.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.400
It's on PyPI.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.860
Great.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:37.520
Let's use it.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.380
Like, no, no, no.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:44.140
So it just so happened to be that that's a common hallucination that was like typo squatted.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.840
But instead of being a typo, it's a hallucination squat type of thing.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:49.600
Crazy, right?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.220
Yeah.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.960
Or you could be a nice person and actually do the package, like create one.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:55.640
Yes.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:56.100
Yes.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.040
I mean, that would be great.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:57.580
All right.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:58.900
Really quick.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:10.800
we talked about, I talked about, I lamented the demise of Firefox Send and how there's a limited version of Firefox Send coming back when I talked about some of the changes of Firefox a few episodes ago.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:11.580
So

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:42.580
Raphael Woe sent us a message, said, hey, since you mentioned Firefox Send, there's this really cool open source project that does peer-to-peer file transfers at pizza, file.pizza of all places. Okay. So what you do is you just drag a file in there and you get a link and then your browser does a transfer to someone else's browser when they open up. So I'm guessing you got to keep the tab open or something like that. That's pretty interesting, right? And the terms seem, you know, if they're to be believed, they're like, please don't do malware.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:26:00.720
Only share stuff if you want. Don't share stuff you don't own, et cetera. Right. It's real, real simple. So that's super cool. Also, it's open source, so you can download it and play with it if you want. It uses WebRTC to have like a video call of the file across. I don't really know.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:21.140
But there's also something else. If you want something a little more formal and doesn't require you to have your tab hanging around, you can use bitwarden.send, which is really, really cool. Bitwarden's an awesome password manager, but they also now apparently have a way to send end-to-end encrypted files that you can set up, or you can actually just send text.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.640
You can say, here's a big block of text.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:23.980
I had to send that to someone.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:30.340
For one of the sponsors, they said, please send me all your bank account information for wire transfers.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:39.640
I'm like, I really don't want to put that in email because it's going to end up on somebody's Outlook that's just got the password, which is just the lower lettercase A to get into that machine that's going to get stolen.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.920
So let's not do that.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.020
So I sent it to him this way.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:42.600
Super cool.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.460
Just said, here's the text.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.100
End-to-end encrypted and send it.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.600
So a bunch of cool ways to send things around.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.020
That's actually pretty cool.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:55.020
I like the secure way because I've got, I mean, I've got like my accountant and a couple other companies that send me secure things.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.920
But I don't know how to do that.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:02.200
If I need to send something secure to somebody else without having to go through somebody else's figuring it out.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.380
So thanks for covering this.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:04.900
This is cool.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.440
Yeah.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:05.880
Yeah.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.340
They're both, both of them are cool options.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.620
They're just super different use cases.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.100
Yeah.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.320
And that's it for my extras.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:11.140
You ready for a joke?

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:11.640
Yeah.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.440
Or you go to jail.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.260
Or you go to jail.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.500
Go to jail.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.140
People know.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:46.520
this is so funny so there's the guy uh i don't he's a german guy i don't know what his real name is because every character he plays is a different name based on the persona but his um his youtube channel is programmers are also human i think when programmers are human programmers are also human anyway he did a really fantastic series of videos that are just so funny about vibe coding and for If people don't know, vibe coding is like you just talk to the AI and you just let it go.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.320
You don't try to code it.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.380
You don't assist it.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.800
You just keep giving it instructions to make changes until your app is done.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.000
I know you watch this, Brian.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:54.840
What do you think?

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.580
I think this guy's a genius.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.580
This is hilarious.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.380
I love it.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:27:59.620
It's

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.360
so good.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.460
Have we tested our code?

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:01.680
Sure.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.700
We tested it on TikTok.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:04.760
Exactly.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.600
Are you caching the data?

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.960
Yeah, we're caching in on the data.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.600
Caching in big time.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.720
Yeah, so I'm going to link to two videos.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:13.940
You should watch them both.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:20.460
The first one, Nick Moore and a couple other people sent this over, I believe, and that was really, really funny.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.560
The second one is even funnier.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.220
The second one is Senior Engineer Tries Vibe Coding.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.780
Yeah, excellent.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:29.340
No,

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.400
no, no, no, no.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.200
This part of the code is holy.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.080
You do not touch this.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.280
You just work on the UI.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.780
I told you not JavaScript.

00:28:38.679 --> 00:28:39.080
Exactly.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.000
So I'm not going to play it because it's like 10 minutes and whatever.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.340
I don't even know how much we have rights to do so.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.880
But I'm going to link to them.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.860
And I strongly encourage you, anytime you need a little bit of a laugh, especially if AI drives you crazy, you're going to really enjoy this.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.380
Yeah.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.620
And totally safe for work.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.380
Unless you get in trouble for laughing at work, then don't.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.080
No fun here.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:00.660
No fun here.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.220
This is your job.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.300
No, this is really great.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.060
I think people should definitely check it out.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:05.640
Definitely.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.140
Definitely.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:06.520
All right.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.020
Brian, thank you.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:08.740
See you later.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:09.180
Bye.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:09.520
Thanks,

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.160
everyone, for listening.
