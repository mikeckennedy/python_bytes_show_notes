00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.700
So, Michael, let's kick it off.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.160
Let's kick it off.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.440
I want to talk about a little bit of jitter.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.040
Maybe I've had too much coffee this morning or something.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.560
I don't know.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.060
What do you think?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.220
Jitter is a thing from the folks at Pydantic.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:30.140
And the idea here is they need really fast JSON parsing as the foundation of Pydantic.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.080
Basically, Pydantic is about how do I exchange, validate, and transform JSON data with Python

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.040
classes, right?

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.020
Into Python classes.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.440
Okay.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.940
Yeah.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.700
So, you want that to be fast.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.240
The folks over at Pydantic created this thing called Jitter, G-I-T-E-R.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.920
And it is a fast iterable JSON parser.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.420
Now, if the Pydantic usage does not catch your attention, OpenAI is also using Jitter, which is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.220
pretty interesting.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.600
Ask ChatShiftPT about it.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.340
So, the reason that they were interested in it is they want to be able to work with,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.580
I believe Pydantic as well, but they want to work with responses coming out of LLMs.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.780
And anyone who's used LLMs until maybe very recently knows that they kind of like spit out

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.340
the answers in a little progressive way, right?

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.020
And so, with this, you can parse parts of data as it comes down, which is pretty cool.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.340
So, there's some examples of partial in here.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.560
You can go look for somewhere, I think maybe on the docs website or something like that.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.240
But, you know, you can give it like a partially formed string and it'll come up with like

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.680
perfectly good answers for it.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.340
So, that's pretty neat.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.400
And that's one of its features.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.740
The other is that it's faster than what I think the default Rust JSON parser is.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.160
Even for non-iterable, just straight parse it, which is, that's pretty impressive.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.680
Okay.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.220
And then there's also, this is why we are talking about it, there's Python parse, which

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.640
parses JSON strings into a Python object.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.620
So, you can go and run that as well, which is pretty cool.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.080
Shooter example.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.480
Anyway, yeah.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.240
So, you can go and parse it into different pieces using, basically, if you need a really

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.840
fast JSON parser with Python, you can use Python parse and it'll parse into a structure, right?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.240
Yeah.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.440
So, awesome.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.960
I thought people might be interested in both an iterable, iterating JSON parser, and back

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.440
to this one.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.520
Iterating JSON parser and also a really fast one.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.280
Plus, it's being built by the folks at Pydantic, Sam Colvin and team.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.120
And yeah, excellent.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.800
Nice work.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.500
Oh, yeah.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.960
I think I've got several uses for this.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.380
This is cool.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.960
Yeah, cool.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.700
Yeah.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.760
I recently had Samuel Colvin on with David Seddon to talk about building Rust extensions

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.680
or integrating Rust with Python and things like that and talk Python.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.100
And he talked about this as one of the things they're building, which is like, oh, okay, this

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.660
is pretty interesting.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.820
Yeah, definitely.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.680
Well, I'm going to talk about Python pre-built a little bit.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.320
This is big news, Brian.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.600
I'm glad you're covering it.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.520
So, Python build standalone is a project that we've talked about on the show, but mostly we

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.020
talked about it in association with uv.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:23.280
Because if you use uv sync or uv install Python or uv virtual environment or uv vnv and then install

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.440
and use Python there, if it can't find it on your system, the Python in your system, it's

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.360
going to pull it from Python build standalone, which is a separate project, not part of uv.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.120
So, we've discussed that.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.740
But the big news right now is that Python build standalone is now part of Astral or under the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.820
Astral umbrella, which is huge.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:52.740
So, yeah, we're going to link to an article from Charlie Marsh, head of Astral, saying a new

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.160
home for Python build standalone.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.640
There's also a, it just says we'll be taking over, we'll be taking stewardship of this project

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.080
from Gregory Zork, I don't know, cool last name.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.740
Anyway, the foundational project for building and installing portable Python distributions.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.440
And there's a link to Gregory's announcement also.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.480
And the discussion around that, like the Python build standalone powers uv, powers Rai, also

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.040
PipX and Hatch and more.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.840
And it's got like 70, 70 million downloads so far.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.380
Wow.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.980
Pretty big project and definitely instrumental to going forward with Python or with Python

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.500
packaging and using Python.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:47.980
So, Astral is really like trying to make uv with along with this Python build standalone project, the new way to install Python.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.300
And for me, it is.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.380
I'm using it all every day now.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.180
So 100% same for me.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.460
So pretty short article talking about this.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.180
But it is kind of interesting.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.220
It talks about what the project is at first.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.800
It talks about the future of Python standalone Python distributions.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.460
Also, what they have in mind for the project.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.640
It looks like they want to keep the project up to date with Python releases, of course.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.620
And then upstream changes to the CPython build system, possibly.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.820
And then remove some of the third is remove some of the project's existing limitations.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.480
What are the existing ones?

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.980
It ships some MUSL-based Python builds.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.220
They're incompatible with Python extension modules.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.420
I don't know what that means.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.560
I don't know what MUSL is, so I'm going to move on from that.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.080
Okay.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.200
And then improve the project's Python build and release process.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.800
Just a good stewardship for this project, and I'm really happy about that.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:54.760
Along with this, I was interested to read a thread from Charlie Marsh about what said Python build standalone has exploded

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.340
in popularity with over 70 million downloads all time.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:07.340
I'm going to put a link to this thread on Blue Sky into the show notes also, because it's an interesting discussion.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.040
And I learned something through here that I didn't know before.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.480
It said that the Python...

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.360
I didn't know this.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:24.180
That the Python.org download, the download from Python.org, it actually downloads an installer that builds Python from source on your machine.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.180
For Linux.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.000
For Linux.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.400
Okay.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.720
It says for Linux.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.200
Okay.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.100
So for Linux.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.140
Yeah, because the macOS and the Windows ones install way too fast.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.480
The building Python from source is like a 10-minute deal if it runs the tests and stuff.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.200
Okay.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.640
Yeah.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.360
So I didn't think I was doing that on...

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.520
Yeah.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.960
Anyway.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.420
You didn't get the error VCVars bat that couldn't be found?

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.020
No.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.700
I haven't seen that for a while.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:57.640
So yeah, I guess a bigger deal for people that are not running Windows or Mac, but that's really like all the servers and stuff.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.800
Yeah.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:05.840
Well, I think the other thing that's really non-obvious here is like, what is this build standalone anyway?

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.260
Why don't we just download the installer and just run it or just take the result of the installer and clunk it out into your machine or something?

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:21.480
So my understanding is the non-standalone one depends on other foundational things in the system, especially in Linux, but also in other places.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.740
If you want to be able to just copy it over, you can't do that.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:35.980
And so one of the things that they're talking about, one of the four points of the direction that they're trying to go that Charlie laid out was trying to upstream some of these changes back into CPython itself.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.160
I think it might be number one of the future.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:39.700
Yeah.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.320
Upstream the...

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.040
No, number two.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.440
Yeah.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:50.860
Upstream the changes to the CPython build system because they have to patch Python in order to make this actually build, which is why it's a pain in the butt to maintain.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:56.600
And then how many combinatorial variations of that do you get for different platforms and stuff, right?

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.000
Yeah.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.980
And so trying to say, look, we've done these things to make it build more simply with fewer dependencies.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.860
Let's maybe make that part of Python.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:11.560
I don't know about you, but I have not seen a single problem with uv Python, Python build standalone Python, compared to system Python.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:19.900
It's not like, oh, well, the certificates don't validate or this thing doesn't work or it doesn't have SSL or some weird thing like a dependency might be missing.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.880
It seems fine to me.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:37.280
And actually, I would be more worried about installing it separately and building it on each of the machines I'm installing it on than I would having one install that goes everywhere.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.520
Yeah.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.000
Yeah.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.400
Anyway.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.040
Yeah.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:49.520
And I can tell you that Pythonbytes.fm is powered by Python 313.1 based, derived from, or gotten from, this method here.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:49.940
Yeah.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.300
Yeah.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:50.680
Anyway.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:10:08.240
Big news that actually probably doesn't mean much to individual users other than I think that we can try, we had a little bit of concern about whether or not, you know, this one project, it was sitting heavily on one person, one developers to maintain.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.540
And I'm glad that it's Astral helping out with this now, too.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:11.880
Yeah.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.620
I agree.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:25.400
And if you read Greg's announcement there, transferring Python build standalone stewardship to Astral, that he talks about how the Astral folks actually for a while have been core contributors to the project.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.720
And they've been working from the outside to help keep this thing going because they realize how important it is to this feature, right?

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.280
Yeah.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:41.140
And also, I read, I don't know if it was in this or somewhere else, but I essentially read that the project was, I mean, Astral was really working on it for several months anyway.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.900
Yeah.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.300
Exactly.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.500
This is mostly an official announcement is all.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.340
Yeah.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.700
But one final parting thought, Brian, is right there in where you are.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.360
It says, as, this is in Greg's announcement, as I wrote in my Shifting Open Source,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.280
priorities in March.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.740
Yeah.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.640
This is an interesting challenge that people can run into with projects that are run by one person, right?

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.060
Yeah.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:08.380
The guy had a kid, wanted to spend more time with the kid, was feeling worn out by the projects and decided.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:15.400
Well, and also talks about how he really just cares way more about Rust than he does about Python these days, which is fine.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:22.560
Like, you're not married, you know, for life to a technology, you know, go where your heart takes you.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.480
But that's a challenge for projects that are run by one person.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:34.960
So I think it's worth reading this thing as well, just for people to get a sense of, you know, when open source projects take off, but it's not necessarily a good fit.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.280
Yeah.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.420
Yeah.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:36.820
Yeah.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.420
Yeah.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:45.720
He's also known for the PyOxidizer project, which came close, but didn't quite get us a single binary of our Python apps.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.300
Yeah.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:46.900
Interesting.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.400
Okay.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:47.960
Yeah.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.920
I really am.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.540
It's really cool that he made sure that this was in good hands before shifting it over.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.460
Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.200
Absolutely.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.740
All right.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.160
All right.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.680
On to the next.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.100
On to the next thing.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.220
So I talked about, there's a theme here.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.020
I talked about the jitters from having too much coffee.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.060
Well, let's talk about mocha.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.640
Maybe if we put some hot chocolate and some sugar in with it, it'll be better.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.540
No, probably not.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.600
So this project, this project is by Delario and it's called Mocha Pie.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.540
So Mocha, let's like work our way inside out.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:28.220
So Mocha is a high performance concurrent caching library for Rust, not a concurrent caching server like Redis.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.280
Think SQLite, but for caching, right?

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.720
SQLite is written in C, not Rust, but it's an in-process sort of deal,

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.260
which is pretty, pretty neat.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.020
And it's this itself is inspired by caffeine for Java, right?

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.240
This is kind of like turtles all the way down, like ports all the way down.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.860
So it provides a caching implementation on top of dictionaries.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.960
They support full concurrency of retrievals in the high expected concurrencies for updates.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.500
All right.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:00.560
So thread safe, highly concurrent in-memory cache implementation, sync and async can be bounded by the maximum number of entries,

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:06.760
the total weighted size, size aware eviction, like kicking large things out versus small things.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.620
You can have cache controlled by least frequently used, by last recently used.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:19.780
Like I want to kick out things that are over two minutes, but if you've got room based on something, that's fine.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.200
You can give them a time to live, a time to idle, right?

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.860
Idle is a really cool, interesting one.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.600
Like when was this last access?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:32.360
So if you've got something that's old, but is used all the time in your app, and it's something that's somewhat new,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:38.380
but it kind of hasn't got used that much, it'd be better to kick out that new one rather than the old one, right?

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.040
Oh, yeah.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.500
Okay.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.160
So that's all just straight Mocha.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.120
Mocha Py is Python binding for this.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.220
Here we go again.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.760
Rust library for Python.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.760
They're probably getting VC money from this.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.620
I'm telling you.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.180
Okay.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.000
No, just joking.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.600
Sort of.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.720
So for the Mocha Py thing, it has a synchronous cache, which supports basically thread save memory.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.860
It just like wraps the thing.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:06.240
So time to live, time to idle, size of concurrency, all these things that you can imagine.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.060
And so there's a couple interesting ways.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.560
You can just say cache.set some value, or you can say cache.get some value.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.740
That's one way to use it.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.380
Another one is you can use it as, this is actually pretty amazing.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.900
You can use it as an LRU cache function decorator alternative.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:23.760
Oh, wow.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.200
Right?

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.980
So one of the things you can do that's really easy to speed up Python code with not writing

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.060
much code, you don't have to maintain much, is you just put a decorator, functools.lru

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.020
cache onto it, and it'll look at the hash value of all the inbound parameters and say, if you

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.200
pass me the same parameters, you're getting the same output, right?

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:41.620
Yeah.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.680
And it just does that, just straight in Python memory.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.480
But this would be backed by this high-performance concurrent Rust internal library.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.580
It's still in process, right?

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.000
Yeah.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.100
So you can say, yeah, go ahead.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.280
Sorry.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.420
With the time to live and time to, you know.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.580
Time to idle, yeah.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:55.940
Especially.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.660
That's cool.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.280
Yeah.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.080
This is pretty cool.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:05.320
And there's so much talk about the thing supporting the Mocha itself, the Rust version, supporting

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.380
asynchronous behavior, right?

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.520
I'm like, okay.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:15.360
If it has all these asynchronous capabilities, what's the story with Python and its async and

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:15.900
await, right?

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.280
Yeah.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.340
So I filed an issue, which I don't really like to do, but that's how you ask questions,

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.360
apparently, and then you close it.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.000
So I said, hey, cool project.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.400
Since it says thread safe, highly concurrent in-memory implementation, what's the Python

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.120
async story?

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.200
Great.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.160
And so they responded, this will work if you put the decorator on there.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.900
So remember how I was complaining that it's sort of weird that the func tools and iter

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.300
tools don't support async?

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:42.820
Yeah.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.640
This, this func tool like thing, supports async and sync functions as well.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:48.860
Right?

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.260
So they just have a implementation in the center that says, is it a coroutine?

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.660
Do this else do that.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.520
So you can use the cache, the caching decorator.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.160
Like we talked about, like the LRU cache thing already async on async functions and sync functions.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:02.800
So that's fine.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.000
And then I said, well, what about cache, get and set?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.460
And Deliro says, probably doesn't make sense to do it.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.680
It takes 230 nanoseconds.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:18.840
So you can do 4.4 million calls a second and set is a 1.3 million sets per second for a

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.040
cache size of 10,000.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.900
That's fully occupied on a simply M1 Mac.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.900
So, you know what?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.500
Hmm.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:30.160
Probably not, but there might be some, some, ways to expand this in the future.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.660
I don't know.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.520
But yeah, I would say probably not, probably not needed because you're going to probably

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.860
add more overhead just to juggle the async stuff.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.180
Right?

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.100
Yeah.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.140
Yeah.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.920
And also just if the, if the supported,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.820
method is through the decorator and whatever you need, you could just put like your code

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.960
in a function to do.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.320
Yeah.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.780
I mean, if that were Redis, you would absolutely want an async version because you're talking

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.580
to another server.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.100
Yeah.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.920
And there's that latency in the network and all, but yeah, if you can do 4 million a second,

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.800
then probably I doubt you can do 4 million awaits a second.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.160
So that it's much lower.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.420
So the cache get and set really are just that where you, the benefit of those is, is probably

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.840
just for, because we want a really fast caching system or something.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.220
Yeah.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:10.900
Yeah, exactly.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.420
And you, there's plenty of times where you say in this situation, I want to get this out

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.840
of the cache and then keep it for a while.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.120
Like if I had a user who logged in and I want to just hold their user account with all their

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.900
details and I've used their ID as the key and their actual user object as the object that

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.180
goes in, that's fine, but you wouldn't, you wouldn't use that as a cache decorator because

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.180
typically you might see that coming out of a database, something like that.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.900
And then if you pass the same user in, it's like, it's similar, but it's a different database

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.560
object.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.060
Right.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.380
You can run into real weird situations where they're equivalent, but they're not equivalent,

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.500
you know, and then you end up not using cache.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.660
So anyway, I think that might be where you would do it.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.780
But anyway, I think this is pretty cool.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.380
People can check it out.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:51.700
Yeah.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.240
And it's, it is not, I don't believe it is like super popular here.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.360
And you know, a hundred stars, it kind of shine a light on it.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.920
But if you go over to the Mocha thing, you know, it's got a thousand, 700 stars and this

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.780
is kind of just a Python UI on top or API on top of it.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.220
Yeah.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.900
But it's, it's pretty recent.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.500
I mean, it's a few weeks old.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.060
Looks like.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.400
So it's just a baby.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.300
Just a baby.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.620
It's okay to have a hundred stars.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.680
Pretty good for that.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.340
It's pretty good actually.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.160
Yeah, it's pretty good.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.760
It looks cool.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.820
So now, you know, all right.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.540
I want to shift back to uv.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.140
I'm kind of in a uv mood.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.700
I'm missing the sun apparently.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:34.940
But the, there's an article from SAP, from, from the SAS Pegasus blog about uv and in-depth

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.000
guide to Python's fast and ambitious new package manager.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.680
And a lot of people have written about uv already, which is great.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:47.680
But I really, I have been really excited about when I thought, when I learned about uv sync

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.600
and started using that and all the different ways to use uv.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.180
It's a pretty powerful tool.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.140
So it's not really one thing.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.520
It's designed to be a lot.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:02.240
So, so I appreciate, you know, articles like this, but also I really like this one.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:09.160
So it starts out with pretty much who is, which is a funny meme of, of a whole bunch of different

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:15.420
commands to install, install Python and update it and install, create a virtual environment

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.000
and sync your requirements.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.480
And all of that is just done with uv sync.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.140
Now you can do it all in one, which is pretty sweet.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.980
I don't use uv sync.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.740
I use uv, V, and V, dash, dash, Python 3.13 or something.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.500
But, you know, same.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.060
Yeah, I'm using both depending on whether or not I have a project set up already.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.200
So it talks about what is uv, why use it.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.200
And we're just going to assume that you already know if you listen to this podcast because it's

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.780
really fast.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:50.940
But a lot of discussion of different workflows talks about installing, adopting uv into your

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.140
existing workflows, doing install.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.280
But I'm going to pop down to the end, adopting uv into your workflow.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.560
There's this cool cheat sheet.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.620
This is pretty much what the entire article talks about, the different parts, is you can

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.420
use uv Python install to install Python.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.720
You can use virtual environment or VENV to create virtual environments.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.580
It's really fast.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.000
And then install packages with uv pip install.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.280
But then also you can build your dependencies.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.260
Like we would have used pip compile.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.100
You can use uv pip compile.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.740
But it's all in one place to all these different commands.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.180
And these really are the commands.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:33.460
The commands listed in this article are really the way I use uv as well.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.020
So that's why I appreciated it.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:41.140
And then a discussion about how to adopt this into your workflow and what that means to

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.060
get, you know, talking about.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.420
I mean, a lot of people might not have used sort of lock files before.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.820
But using lock files with uv, it's so easy that, you know, why not?

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.580
And pinning your dependencies.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.680
Just some good workflow.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.740
It's good Python project practices anyway.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.600
So why not?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.520
Yeah.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.120
Yeah.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.400
That's great.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.820
And there's even a few more that you could throw in for the tool, like the equivalency

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.880
table there.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.380
Yeah.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.620
You know, there's you.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.280
There's you for installing CLI tools.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.040
You could say pip X.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.480
Yeah.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.240
And just create a virtual environment and install the things and make that in the path and all

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.760
those sorts of things versus uv tool install or uv run.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.180
Right.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.140
Those kind of things as well.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.800
So, yeah.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.620
Yeah.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.120
It's missing that, which is, you know, I'll feed it back to Corey.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:40.560
So one of the reasons why this came up on my radar is I'm working on a project that uses

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.640
SAS Pegasus.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.540
So I'm in touch with Corey a lot.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.340
Yeah.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:50.160
But like the uv, the tool thing, instead, I'm not using pip X anymore.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.300
I'm the uv tool install is like super cool.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.860
So, yeah, it's super cool.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.380
It is.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.620
I've also started using Docker for certain things as well.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.300
So, yeah, it's kind of kind of similar.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.880
But like, for example, Glances, which is a Python based server UI visualization tool,

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.420
you can just say Docker run Glances versus installing Glances.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.040
And you just leave this machine a little more untouched.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:13.560
Yeah.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:21.000
One of the interesting things about this article was the point of view, because at the start,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.600
Corey talks about how he's not usually somebody to jump on like multi-tool fads, like pipenv

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.560
or pyenv for installing.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.420
For doing virtual environments better and big project-wise.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:43.100
And I like Hatch, but I'm not really a using Hatch for my entire workflow sort of person.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.140
I was using it just for a packager.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:51.960
So, yeah, I'm in the same boat of like, I didn't really need an all-in-one tool, but this one changed my mind.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.580
And I really like this all-in-one tool.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.300
So, yeah.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.860
I'm still not bought into the project management side, but I love using uv for the stuff.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.060
Yeah.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:00.200
Yeah.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:00.280
Yeah.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.540
Anyway, what do we got next?

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.740
We have a quick bit of follow-up here.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:04.980
Okay.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.840
I just did some searching.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.040
So, over on PipX.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:16.300
So, one of the things that, you know, you say like, you could use PipX or there is an open issue on PipX that says integrate uv in some way.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:16.540
Right?

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:23.060
Because PipX is really just a wrapper around create virtual environment, pip install package, pip install dash U package.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.580
Right?

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:31.120
And so, if they just change the internals to say uv pip install, then PipX would all of a sudden become super awesome.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:37.040
This recommendation is unfortunately over half a year old, but it does have 21 upvotes.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:37.700
So, you know what?

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.120
Yeah.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.640
Who knows?

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.260
That's there.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:39.740
Yeah.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.160
Okay.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:40.940
Yeah.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:41.380
Okay.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.000
But that's not what I want to cover next.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.080
Come on, computer, respawn.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.720
There we go.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.160
I think that's it for our items, right?

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.880
We're on to extras.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.720
Let's have extras now.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.160
Yeah.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.300
Let's extra it up.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:51.740
Extra.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.840
So, registered for PyCon, I did.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.620
Oh, cool.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.260
Yeah.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.860
Registration came out two days ago.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.200
I don't know.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:03.460
Whenever I posted some message on Blue Sky and Mastodon saying, I registered.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:03.900
How about you?

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.280
Whenever that was, that's when the announcement came out.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.060
So, I think a day and a half ago or something like that.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.560
So, there's early bird pricing and all details on there.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.840
If you want to go and check it out.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:19.680
It's normally $450 for individuals, but you could save $50 if you register for January,

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.640
which is pretty cool.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.360
There's a bunch of stuff.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.760
It has all the detailed timeline, which is always interesting.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.520
You know, like, if I want to make sure I attend the PyLadies auction, when do I need to do that?

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.220
When is the main thing?

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.020
When is the job fair?

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:32.360
Et cetera.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.380
So, most importantly, main conferences, May 16 to May 18, 2025.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.000
So, there it is.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.140
And congruent with current times mask policy.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:41.600
Hooray.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.160
Optional and encouraged, but not required.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:44.580
Yeah.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.000
How about that?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.660
Yeah.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:45.980
Cool.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.740
Okay.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.540
Got a few more real quick ones here.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.960
I recommend, you know what?

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.700
It's something I came across just thinking, like, why don't I support more open source projects?

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.940
Looking at my dependencies and stuff that I'm working on.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:03.180
Like, how much, you know, if everybody who used Flask put $1 towards it per month.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.940
Everybody who used it in an important way where it's not just like, oh, I did a tutorial with Flask.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.420
But, like, no, I have a project that is important to me and I use Flask.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.780
If everyone put $1 towards it, it would transform that project.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:19.620
If everyone who used G-Unicorn put $1 towards it, that would transform it, right?

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.800
So, I decided, you know what?

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.900
I'm going to just go to some projects and find the one that I use most.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.380
And, yeah, I found four that had sponsorships that were available.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.980
I was going to support uv and Pynantic as well.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.000
But they, for some reason, they do, like, corporate sponsorships.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.280
Or I tried to do individuals and it didn't work.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.700
And then some other ones, like Beanie, don't currently have sponsorships.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.660
But, you know, are really important for the database layer and stuff.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.380
But just think about, you know, put a couple dollars towards some of these projects.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.600
It'll make zero difference to you if you have a job as a software developer.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.520
And in the aggregate, it'll make a big difference to the health of the ecosystem.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.120
Yeah.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.520
It's interesting to think about like that.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.220
Like, just, you know, a couple less coffees a month.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.280
And you can help out.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.040
You probably cover, like, three or four projects.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.600
Yeah.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.140
Yeah.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.620
Anyway.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.360
I want to encourage people to do that.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.380
But, you know, can't.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.100
Obviously, don't.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.760
But I don't think it's a big deal.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.080
Come here, computer.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.740
Very slow for some reason.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.680
Don't know why.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.480
There we go.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:16.720
All right.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.820
This is the joke.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.540
So I'm skipping the joke for a second.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.100
We'll come back to it.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.780
There's two things that I wasn't planning on covering.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.780
But I'll throw out here really quick.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.600
Yeah.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.940
Here's my register for PyCon.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.980
I also wrote a quick.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.600
People said, oh, my God.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:27.940
Hetzner.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.700
We moved to Hetzner.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.920
And they changed this huge thing where they changed their bandwidth and their price.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.040
And it's like a no nothing sort of deal.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.660
Like $5 a month more.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.800
Anyway, I wrote that up so people can check that out on Mastodon.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.300
And then, yeah, that's it for all my items.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:43.460
Okay.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.380
And then I just got the joke when you're ready for that.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.320
So let's do yours.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.780
I don't have much commentary on these.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.720
I just have a few extra things I wanted to point out.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:59.580
Pydantic AI was announced, which Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework designed to make

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.500
it less painful to build production-grade applications with generative AI.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.000
I don't have really in the commentary about this other than I didn't see this coming.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.880
But interesting.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.140
Yeah, I've seen messages or tweets or whatever from people who do machine learning stuff saying,

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.460
you just need Pydantic.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.220
I mean, a lot of this is like, I got a JSON thing here.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:23.160
And then I'm going to call some other thing with other JSON and just suggesting, hey, you

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.000
could probably use Pydantic to make these connections.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.360
I bet the Pydantic team noticed that as well.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:27.840
Okay.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.360
A couple commentaries on maybe society.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.880
And anyway, I'll leave it.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.460
Leave the couple other articles I thought was interesting.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:43.920
Blue Sky announced, I guess this is old, this is from August, but anti-toxicity features on

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.380
Blue Sky.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.520
And I just actually appreciate some of these.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.800
I already have hit, I had a troll come by.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.840
And so there's some things where you can, if people, you can detach a quoted post.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.880
If somebody quotes you and you don't want them to, you can detach yourself from that.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.900
Oh, interesting.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.320
I had hiding replies.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:11.440
I had some, a troll, you can't like delete replies, but I had somebody just, just idiotic reply to

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.460
something I said.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.960
And it was obviously just a bot or a troll.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.700
So you can, you can hide that.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.360
And as, you know, as Blue Sky grows, we'll, we'll get trolls also.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.700
If they're, if they're not affecting you yet, they, they may in the future.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.960
So, so we do appreciate that there's, there are features around to protect yourself.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.300
So there's, there's that.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:36.340
And then, this, I don't know what to make of this really, but Wired, fairly mainstream

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:41.940
magazine, I think, has released the Wired guide to protecting yourself from government

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.560
surveillance.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.440
Wow.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.540
I'm, I just, this is a head shaker of like, I guess we need this.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.680
I wish we didn't, but wow.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.340
yeah, there's that.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.620
So, yeah, I can probably say that about some state governments as well.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.260
Right.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.060
Every state's different, but yeah.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.060
Yeah.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.860
Yeah.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:04.880
Pitting on your gender and things, you know, it's touch and go some places.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.220
Yeah.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:05.680
Anyway.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.360
So, that's a little bit of a downer.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.740
So maybe we need something funny.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.440
we do.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.800
I don't want to spend all the time going down that, that deep rabbit hole.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.580
Instead, let's go infinitely down the rabbit hole.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.020
Yes.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.380
So check this out, Brian.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:26.360
Somebody who goes by bits, very personal on, on, Blue Sky posted what the comments

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.420
seem to indicate is probably a textbook.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.860
A print is a printed, by the way, a printed textbook on a LaTeX.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.180
Okay.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:34.760
Okay.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:41.220
So, I'm going to see you in the index at the back.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.240
And it says, see page 252.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.420
I love it so much.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.700
It's so simple.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.480
I love it.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:47.720
Yeah.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.700
It's a really good, just like a little Easter egg in there, isn't it?

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:52.220
Yeah.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.540
I, I've, I haven't seen it for infinite loop.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.320
I saw that, somebody did that for recursion.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.200
In some, yeah.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.260
Yeah.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.320
They, they, they're, if you look in the comments, it says that, Carrington and Richie has

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.100
the same, I guess that's probably C or something.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.540
Yeah.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.840
The same in, under the index for recursion.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.940
And, it's pretty, pretty good.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.660
People love it.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.000
Yeah.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.200
No, that's funny.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.080
And there's somebody that says, for those who can't be bothered, search, Google search

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:15.700
for recursion.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.740
Did you mean recursion?

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:19.480
Yeah.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.300
I kind of feel bad for people that actually really need to know what that means.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.780
Good luck.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.520
Yeah.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.200
Good luck with that.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:27.380
Huh?

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.360
so.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.100
Wow.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:29.300
Yeah.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:29.880
All good.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.680
All good here.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.360
We know what recursion and infinite loops are, but we're going to break the loop and get

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:34.560
out of here.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:34.720
Right?

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.140
Yeah.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:35.620
Yeah.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.920
Let's break the loop and say goodbye until next time.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.960
So thanks a lot.
