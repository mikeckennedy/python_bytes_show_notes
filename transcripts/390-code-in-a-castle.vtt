We've got lots of interesting information that we share with you and we're gonna be doing some kind of giveaway that we have yet to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.040
Determine and soon when we reach maybe a major milestone there, so that'll be awesome

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.680
Yeah, and yeah with that right now kick us off. Well, you guys are us. Let's talk about strings for a minute. So

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.080
this one is from an article written by Veronica Olson and

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.640
It's an article called joining strings in Python

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.280
uh-huh moment and I actually just really enjoyed this story because it's a it it tricked me up and and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.320
she says I've been writing Python code for 17 years and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.280
And it's then I learned something new recently from a mastodon conversation. So so what is the new thing?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.680
So the idea is is around joining strings

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.640
So let's say you're you've got your like and we do we do this. I do this all the time

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.200
so you've got some input from a file and and her example is got some input from a file and you're going through and just

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.280
Just using it using the read generator thing

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.600
So if equals open and you get like this thing that you can read with so she's using

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.480
X for X or I usually put line line for line in F

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.000
And then also doing like some some logic on it within a generator, which is kind of cool

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.480
and once I learned this I use it all the time, so

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.040
Go through as a general using the file as a generator to pull out lines and then only collect the lines that you care about

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.400
And then joining it in at the end and so like this discussion really is

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.320
when you've got a whole bunch of line strings that you want to concatenate together with like new lines or something is

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.020
You just create create a list of them and then join it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.480
But if you're using a generator, you can just you can use a generator and pass that to join also

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.440
So the the little trick here is whether you whether or not you should use a list comprehension

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.960
so these these two methods is you're joining a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.240
Generator out of the file or you use a list comprehension within it

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.160
And the only difference is these little little brackets in there to create a generator or to create a list comprehension

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.120
So I would think I would my first reaction is that it really probably doesn't matter

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.920
But the list comprehension might be maybe I have no idea which one's slower or faster

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.680
But the odd thing is if it's a huge text file

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.400
Brian if it's a huge text file, it could be a memory if you had a gig of text, right?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.760
Yeah, then you potentially would be loading more than that in memory with the brackets, but not with the parentheses, right?

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.920
That's what I thought right? So

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.420
So she's got she used a sample file like like the King James Version of the Bible or something

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.240
Yeah, which is?

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.720
800,000 words long and a ballpark of 3,000 pages

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.200
anyway

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.200
200 million words, okay

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.720
so

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.520
did did a little timing here as to whether or not you want to use a generator or list comprehension for this and

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.600
Looking at the memory output so that the memory itself is as expected generator uses less memory

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.120
The list comprehension gradually grows and you're using more memory

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.620
Okay, so far it seems like it's doing what we think it might be doing

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.340
But but the weird bit is when we go down and actually time this stuff

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.880
Is that the the generator version without and and if you compare the times for the generator and the list comprehension

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.400
The generator one is slower by like 16% weird why?

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.840
So that is weird, especially since the list has to like you allocate the list you fill the list you reallocate the list

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.880
You copied over it like growing the list over and over and over is although as a list comprehension, maybe it doesn't I don't know

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.600
So anyway, that's great. And then more adding more

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.560
Mystery to the to the mystery is that instead of if you instead of join if you use all

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.740
As the thing that you're using across the entire list or generator

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.480
It's behaving as expected. The generator is faster than the the comprehension. So what's going on?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.320
So they the discussion went online and Trey hunter

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.120
said

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.480
You should know something about join join is weird in that the CPython

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:20.320
implementation of join has is a to pass because generators can you can't there they get exhausted and you can't use them again, so

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.600
it has some little tricks that it uses to do a to pass over the generator and

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:33.440
So therefore it is it is the same the Joe join is the same as take creating a list

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.960
And we know that comprehensions are a little bit better than actually just creating a list

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.480
So that little bit better is the reason why?

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.640
This the the comprehension version is faster. Well, wait, I have no idea why I

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.680
Should have read more closely

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.840
But there's something about this that makes it faster in when you're using joins to go ahead and use a comprehension faster

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.760
interesting weird and

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.800
It's only in CPython. Apparently, that's not true

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.600
for Pi Pi and

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.380
Yeah, apparently you can I don't know how they're doing it without it but I pie and some others

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.840
implementations of Python do not use this but

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.840
Interesting. Yeah, I don't see that. Yeah, I don't see it tested here. But the web assembly one would be quite interesting

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.880
Yeah for pyrodied and pie strip a pie script and those kinds of things. Yeah

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:35.360
Okay, so interesting inside baseball around I guess around if you want to do memory whether you care about speed or memory efficiency

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.200
And also it's weird that you got to choose though. It is weird that you have to choose

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.320
But also just in case you haven't seen this

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.320
this is the state basically the standard format for

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.080
if you want to iterate through strings and combine them all into one is to

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.160
either throw them in a list or throw them in a comprehension or throw them in generator and use join to

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.960
Combine them with a new line if you haven't seen that before that's a good thing to stick in your tool belt

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.640
Yeah, and our Windows friends can put backslash our backslash in join for their Windows line ending. I'm on Windows

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.640
I don't do that. But okay, I know

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.240
It should still work

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.080
All right. Awesome. Well, what do you have for us next?

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.040
Well, I'm afraid I have some hard truths for you Brian

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.960
Just like you've learned it's a hard truth that generator doesn't always give you the advantages

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:30.720
You thought these are hard truth ten hard truths to swallow that people won't tell you about your brand new software engineering job

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:37.600
so this focused at students who just recently graduated or who are getting into software development and that might sound like a

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:44.760
Somewhat niche crowd but if you look at the PSF jetbrain survey, it's like the biggest group of people are like

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.000
Well, you've been coding for three years or less, which is crazy. All right. Anyway, let's go through the ten

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
This is by menswear Dura Vec

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It's pretty good a pretty good article here and basically says I was talking with a bunch of students and they were all psyched about

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.200
Like startup culture pizza parties and stuff. Yeah. Well, yes, but the thing you're gonna do most the time

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.840
Right in code. So here are the the ten first college will not prepare you for the job

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:16.480
So imagine your instructor spins a you you go to college to learn how to swim your instructor spends a lot of a ton of

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.480
time teaching you about the moves

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.960
Reciting the moves ask you questions about the moves after five years you get a piece of paper that proves your swimming skills

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.800
And you got to go in the pool and you just flail around right a little bit like that

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.640
Also, a lot of the curriculums are pretty far behind

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.960
I remember when I was in college I said, can I please take C++ is in the 90s?

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.280
They're like no you have to take Fortran. It's the most important language you'll ever learn

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.520
I'm like, okay, and then I well, let me try some CS classes like well, you got to do list

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.400
But like really can I please take some something like more modern like no, right?

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.680
So you should have a lot of those. Yeah, I'm still not embracing the list

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.720
I like parentheses, but not that much. Okay

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:05.760
Anyway, so it's like a lot of these folks who are professors have are not not been professional software developers in the engineering sense

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.160
And so like the skills that they teach you are valuable, but it's not the same right as like working day-to-day

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:18.120
This one I think is probably people probably don't realize that much as you rarely get a work on greenfield projects

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:24.800
Yeah, you get brownfield projects that is you get some project. That is not a three-week project

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.080
but it's something that's been around since 2003 and

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.080
You're dropped in to work on some features and every time you poke it

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.640
It's like a rickety house of cards. You got to be super careful. All right, and how is that? Oh, yeah with your understanding

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.440
Yeah, definitely true

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:46.000
that's one of the reasons why I encourage people to do opens phone contribute to open source projects even in large ones because

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.680
There's you have to get used to huge code bases

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.640
You have to get used to getting thrown in the deep end and fix a bug and you don't even know what the code does

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.640
Yeah, this is yeah central speaking which is a fantastic picture for this

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.080
So let me try to zoom that out for a second so we can see here Brian

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.600
So check this check this link out folks

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.600
It's like this crazy Ruben cold Bergen thing

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.080
There's a button to start the app and it's got all these weird wires and there's like an elephant that's

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.240
Suspended and the wire cuts elephant loose which it drops off of rock and there's a security layer

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.960
There's the core logic since 2003

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.080
There's all these like third party bits that are largely controlled by aliens

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.040
And then there's a cloud and below the cloud you can see just the base of the building

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.000
There's two new engineers with a little button that's supposed to like kick this thing off or something says how hard can it be?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Come on. Yeah

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.520
Yeah, amazing. So check that out. All right

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.660
Nobody gives a blankety blank about your clean code

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.820
You may focus on a lot but really your job is to deliver features

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.880
You're expected to write clean code

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.800
But you're not gonna get like promotions and stuff from the business people because you write clean code

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.520
It's because you deliver value right part of that value is clean code. That's true, but you've got to maintain it, too

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.960
So you should be happy. Yes, you've got to live with it. Yeah, so here's what here was my experience

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.240
Not how do you lie?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.720
But how do you phrase things like estimates and stuff so that you're in a position?

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.760
So you don't have to write terrible code constantly, right?

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.200
so for example with testing or a

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.640
Little bit of refactoring. It's just like I would just work that into my estimates. How long is it gonna take?

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.360
It's gonna take a week

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.280
Well probably takes three and a half days, but then if you were to bust it out, right?

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.360
But if you're gonna put in the tests and do it, right, it'll take a week

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.320
So I want to take it takes a week, you know that that kind of thing. Sometimes you'll work with incompetent people

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.320
Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.880
Yes, and sometimes that person will your boss and so that's even even tougher. I'll tell you a story Brian

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.480
You know

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:53.560
I used to do in person training classes and there was there is a person who was in this class as part of a team

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.000
software development team from a like a

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.080
law a medium-sized company one of these like, you know, 50 million yearly revenue type companies or something and

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.280
During that class we were doing like exercises. I'd do a presentation for an hour

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.400
They'd spend maybe half an hour working on something and running around it goes

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:17.560
So there's this part where you need a variable that has a string value. This person has been working for at least six months

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:23.820
I think a lot longer as a professional software developer in this language and I say you got to create a variable there

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:30.000
And you need to assign a string to it that says, you know, XYZ the value the string is XYZ

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.840
So they just write variable name equals XYZ with spaces and all sorts of stuff

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.760
Like no, you can't just type it into the editor. You have to put quotes around it

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.400
What do you mean you have to put quotes around this?

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:49.320
How have you been a professional software developer at a proper company for over six months to a year and not know that?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.660
Sentences with spaces to have quotes around them to put them into code as a piece of text. Like could you imagine?

00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:01.840
That person is like review in your coach like oh my goodness, dude. Yeah, no, I

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.180
That was that was a rough one

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.460
Anyway, sometimes maybe not to that extreme

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.460
But you will probably end up working with ineffective people or people that don't care about your process or people don't care about your clean

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:17.100
Code or whatever right all that stuff's there get used to being number five get used to being in meetings for hours

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.120
This is important part of software development job

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:27.820
Most meetings are not productive because you're being forced to be there by a person whose only job is to have meetings

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.900
That's their job. That's their work, right? Which is

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:37.120
However, other meetings with your team members and stuff planning out. Oh, and I went out is pretty good

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.820
Yeah, if you're the one responsible for the meeting be okay with cutting it short

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:47.160
Getting everybody together and leaving in 10 minutes is fine. Remember that. Yep. Okay 100% Okay

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:52.680
On I feel like you should have done this this art. No, I'll be the heckler in the background. It's fine

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:58.780
It's good. They will ask you for estimates a lot of times, right? I told you about this one. I mentioned this is fun. So

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:05.620
Here's a great cartoon for this one - this is also good. Like basically the joke segment says would you rather?

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:12.120
For better estimates we switched from measuring story points to a different style

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:18.220
We now ask how many duck-sized horses are you willing to fight rather than implement this task?

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.500
In that awesome. Yeah

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.100
Yeah

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.860
And it sounds silly but I kind of think of it is it's actually kind of practical

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:34.780
Yeah, it's using your like your desire to avoid negative stimuli more than your ability to predict something

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:40.780
Love it. Yeah, that was only a two duck side to duck size horse battle

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.340
All right bugs will be arching me for life because they come from different places could be your own code

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.280
But it could be third-party libraries. It could be hardware failure

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.040
Electricity all sorts of things uncertainty be will be your toxic friend

00:14:53.040 --> 00:15:00.060
So could be implementing something you never worked on could be getting transferred to a new project with new technologies

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.740
It could be a move to a new company could be a bug report

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:10.280
The day you need to finish the work and break the deadline job security evolution technology all these things are totally resonate

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.220
Number nine, it will be almost impossible to disconnect from your job

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.180
So yeah, that's rough, but it's true because you're you're thinking about it, right?

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:19.700
Yeah

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.060
however

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.620
This one comes a lot of these come with actually good advice on what to do to combat it or to

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.500
Counteract it or to deal with it. Oh, that's good

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:32.220
Cuz I like one of the best things I ever did was not I don't have the ability to get email on my phone

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.620
Now my work email. Oh, that's nice

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:39.760
And I because I was checking it all the time even on when I was off work and that was bad

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.260
So yeah, it's bad last one number ten

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:49.820
You will profit more from your soft skills than your coding skills. Not that your coding skills are important

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.500
But yeah, definitely soft skills are tough and they're also required

00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:00.060
So things like teamwork learning mindset my management emotional intelligence and empathy approachability

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.140
Persistence confidence all these things amongst a whole zillion others

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.140
Anyway, if you're new, I think this is a pretty good article

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.480
I didn't go through all the little details, but yeah, he's at least ten concepts. I don't know. What do you think right?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.440
uh, can we I think they the tech the soft skills probably out of in at the top the

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:24.580
Being able to communicate well and stay positive and don't be a jerk is huge

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.660
To the ability to not be in a jerk under pressure. That was a struggle for me

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:36.580
Also embracing deadline like that people are gonna ask you how long it's gonna take you have to you just have to learn how to

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.020
Do that estimating is part of the job. It sucks. It's wrong

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:46.260
But you get better at it and you're also okay about telling it. I mean it can be ballparks

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.140
It's gonna be is gonna be two days or is it gonna be two months?

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.980
pick

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.420
People just need to know so yeah. Yeah, absolutely. It's good

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.460
All right, before we move on to the next one

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.220
Let's talk about a sponsor that I'm very excited about. Let me tell you real quick about

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.580
Scout APM. They're big supporters of Python bites. So we appreciate that very much

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:12.900
So if you are tired of spending hours trying to find the root cause of issues impacting your performance

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.700
Then you owe it to yourself to check out Scout APM

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:22.960
They're a leading Python application performance monitoring tool APM that helps you identify and solve performance

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.220
abnormalities faster and easier

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:31.140
Scout APM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks slow database queries background jobs and the dreaded n+1

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:38.140
Queries that you can end up if you do lazy loading in your or am then you say oh no, why is it so slow?

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.940
Why are you doing 200 database queries for what should be one so you can find out things like that

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.700
And it links it back directly to source code

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.260
so you can spend less time in the debugger and

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:52.400
Healing logs and just finding the problems and moving on and you'll love it because it's built for developers by developers

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.380
It makes it easy to get set up. Seriously. You can do it in less than four minutes

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.380
So that's awesome. And the best part is the pricing is

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:05.920
Straightforward you only pay for the data that used with no hidden overage fees or per seat pricing

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:13.500
And I just learned this Brian. They also have they provide the pro version for free to all open source projects

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:19.300
So if you're an open source maintainer and you want to have Scout APM for that project just shoot him a message

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:24.660
There's something on their pricing page about that so you can start your free trial and get instant insights today

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.600
Is it by them by side of him slash Scout the link is in your podcast player show notes as well

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.100
And please use that link

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:36.660
Don't just search for them because otherwise they don't think you came from us and then they'd stop supporting the show

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:42.540
So, please use our link by them by side of him slash Scout check them out. It really supports the show. Cool

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.540
Yes, thank you. Indeed already, right?

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:50.820
Well, we've checked we talked in the past about Python coming to Excel and but I haven't tried it

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.780
so, um

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:57.740
I was kind of curious about this person that wrote up an article called my thoughts on Python in Excel and

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:03.020
This isn't just a rando person. Apparently. This is let's see

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.940
See, or maybe I don't know

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:13.200
They wrote a book on Python and Excel or reported. Yeah, are they creative Excel wings? Maybe? Yeah sure

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:19.740
Oh, yeah as a creator of Excel wings the author of the O'Reilly book Python for Excel. I was obviously curious to try it

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.900
so anyway, uh

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:28.940
Yeah, okay. Anyway, so somebody tried it out. Great. And this is from the Excel wings blog

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:35.340
So yeah, it's probably somebody that's worthwhile looking at this and tried actually really wanted it to work

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.840
So what what are their takeaways and I'm just kind of loving this

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.720
We'll just run through them. he wanted it to be an alternative to VBA VBA

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.600
But mostly got an alternative to the Excel formula language

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.840
Okay, so I thought it was going to be a VBA replacement as well. Apparently not

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.880
The integrate integrating the Jupyter notebook cells inside Excel grid was a mistake

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:04.120
So not sure what they did there, but apparently they didn't like that. So

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:13.160
Python in Excel is not suitable for Python beginners nor for interactive data analysis. That's kind of that's a bummer

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.160
So there's that one person like

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.800
Yeah

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.580
Right now there are too many restrictions. You can't use your own packages. You can't connect to the web APIs

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.500
So what are the current you could use cases?

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.320
probably computationally intensive things like Monte Carlo some

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.820
simulations AI stuff via the included packages like scikit-learn and LK or

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.260
nltk stats model and balance learn

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:45.120
That actually that makes sense. And so there's a that's a good use case

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.540
I guess for being able to use a I scikit-learn stuff in in Excel nice

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.980
being able to use matplotlib and seaborn for

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:59.180
Visualizations, that's pretty cool because these are great packages a time series analysis

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:06.480
And but that's really about it said done not sure about data cleaning or data analysis since you're mostly certain

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.900
Almost certainly need power query. I don't know what this is must be a Excel thing. It's like a bi

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.460
Microsoft Office

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.900
Tableau type of thing I believe okay

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.500
so

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.060
What's the conclusion here before we dive into details?

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:27.460
I want to clarify that this is my personal opinion and not meant to be a rant or critique, but I'm amused by it

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:35.200
I've been in contact with the Excel team a few times and they're super friendly. Okay, so he's he wants the whole thing to succeed

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.840
So we'll just that's good. So these are just interesting takeaways

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.180
one of the things and then goes through a bunch of the

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.500
little bits

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.700
And in more detail the part that wasn't in the the summary

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:55.220
Which I find is interesting is Python is not really in Excel. It's in the cloud, which I'm surprised by

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:04.440
Says as you've probably heard but I hadn't that the Python that you're running runs in an Azure container instance not inside Excel

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.500
That's just kind of weird. I think did you know this?

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.620
Yeah, I did and it's interesting that it means that you can't configure the environment

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.820
You can't control which Python is running

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:22.140
You can't install third-party packages that are not pre-approved like you saw that there was a list of a couple of ML ones

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.700
If you don't like those then you don't use it

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:31.420
Well, can you do it when your laptops disconnected like when you're on an airplane or something? No, I don't think so. Okay. I

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.080
You just like quick to me

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.880
I was hoping for like some kind of VBA like true automation

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:45.120
Yeah sort of beyond the cell this cell that cell but kind of what you do with notebooks and then sometimes you bring in

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.260
Like Excel writer or something to like actually save the stuff out or something, right?

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:56.580
Like a little way to orchestrate bigger. Okay, but yeah, so it's not also yeah, so it's it's just different

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.300
It's just like stuff within a cell. Well multiple cells, but yes, okay

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:07.780
Well, it's not really what I was hoping for for Python and Excel. So anyway, it's also not quite in there, right?

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.700
Say that again. It's not quite in it. As I said, it's in the cloud. Yeah

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:17.020
Yeah, it is weird. That's got to be online only. Yeah, that's kind of a deal-breaker for me

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.580
But maybe I shouldn't be care that much but anyway, yeah

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.900
but one of the comments around that was that

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:29.940
that it's not really a problem for a lot of people because a lot of people are using that are using Excel or already

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:36.740
Sharing their data through one drive and SharePoint and I yeah, I don't know if that's maybe that's a majority of corporations

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:42.500
But there's a lot of corporations like the one I'm in where we cannot do that because we don't want our stuff to go out

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.620
Anywhere, so anyway, yep

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:51.940
Just an interesting takeaway of I guess if you've if you've been hoping and thinking this might be a good article to peruse

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:57.300
Just to make sure that it's really your use case before you jump in. Yeah, good point Christopher out there says

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.060
It's nice that it doesn't require Python to be installed locally

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:08.620
I'm like power bi because I wouldn't be able to have my IT department install it. So that's an interesting bonus there

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:13.960
Hmm, Navarro says you got you got a got a fight for your right to sudo

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:22.560
Yeah, can't you I mean Python now can't you install it on Windows machines? I think you can install it in like personal mode

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.240
That's just in your home directory or something. I don't yeah, I don't think you need like

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:32.640
Administrator privileges anymore. Yeah, that's true without the it's actually true with the

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.180
Python in the Windows Store and Windows 10 and 11. Yeah. Yeah, okay

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:42.560
Henry Schreiner on the audience a Henry says this feels like the perfect use case for WASM sad

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.640
It wasn't the default totally agree some pyro died here would have been awesome. Yeah

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:53.360
All right. I'm not as awesome. Next thing. I'm about to tell you though, Brian. Okay, what's what's the next thing this?

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.640
Special live event course that I'm running. All right, cool

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.400
so this is happening in in October and

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.880
I'm doing a code in a castle event in Tuscany Wow

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.340
So this is a six day

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.840
luxurious

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.000
core course in a lecture luxurious Tuscan Villa and

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.760
Every morning we're gonna wake up and we're gonna spend four hours working on Python and then the rest of the day is

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:33.400
Excursions and winery tours and other stuff around the Italian countryside. This looks like fun. Sounds awesome

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.840
Huh? Yeah, so the course is gonna be super fun

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.680
The course is I called it Python zero to hero, but you don't have to actually be zero

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:47.760
Just you got it just like there's probably some areas of this it would be you haven't any experience with so basically it takes you

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.240
from I'm

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:55.040
Maybe learning Python. Maybe I know Python but then talks about a sink and await MongoDB

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.080
talks about

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.040
We cover a FastAPI using HTMX

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:06.760
We'll be back to that in just a second and building out awesome web apps and web APIs and then performance testing this and then

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.760
deploying it

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:16.200
Linux we got time maybe using doctor as well. So yeah, that's what the plan is and it's gonna be awesome

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.520
So if you were interested in being part of this

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:24.040
click the link and your player show notes and a so show notes there and

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.000
Yeah, you have a Python. I think I'll have a talk Python link

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.120
so talk Python dot FM slash castle is the link and

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:35.500
Everyone when they come they get a room in the villa and the room has up to two beds

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:40.380
So if you wanted to bring your wife or a good friend, there's actually a separate

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:46.580
Set of events for the people who are not in the course, but who are attending the event as like a companion or something

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.800
So there's like morning excursions as well

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.320
Yeah

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:56.040
I was reading up on that and it sounds really pretty like some some good quotes from people from last year enjoying the the

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.520
The plus ones

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:05.100
Having fun in the mornings. So yeah, awesome. Maybe I'll just say the morning track. No, just kidding

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.360
So I forgot to mention this is an extra extra extra. So this is number one of the extra. Okay more

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.840
Okay more so first one code in a castle learn Python FastAPI

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.840
Deployment load testing all that stuff. Hopefully you can be there number two. I

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:27.360
Had this awesome use case for HTMX that is so incredibly clean that I just want to give people a feel for it

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.360
so Brian if you go to

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.320
Top Python click on the courses putting your course here. Okay

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.160
You see it has a price as $59

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.820
But if you're European it would have a price in euros if you were in India

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.820
You would have a price and some else

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:49.940
So in order to pull that all that information in this was usually fast

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:55.260
But periodically would have to hit our credit card processor for places that are less common

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.860
I tried to pre-compute all this but it's like combinatorially out of control

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.160
So if you're like from a certain part of Greece where there's a certain tax

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.980
That's different than another part of you know, like all of that factors into what shows up on this page

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.200
So I just showed him without prices and like well

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.200
What if I could reload like show the page and then recompute the page with prices?

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:21.860
And if it takes 10 seconds for 50 API calls to the credit card processor, so be it and maybe you'll see it

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:27.480
Maybe you won't but if it's already seen that it's saved to the database. We'll just show it to you basically

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.920
Well, really really quick

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.400
So watch it so watch this if I refresh it you can see that

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.480
It flickers for a second and then the prices come back

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.100
Cool

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.360
All of that is in in HTMX and if you look at the implementation of it

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.660
Three lines for that entire client-side implementation of show the page without prices

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:50.200
Instantly start a computation to figure them all out get the answer and then rebuild the page out of that

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.740
Just div HX get some URL HX trigger to load render partial

00:28:54.740 --> 00:29:01.440
This is the implementation that both shows it on the first load without prices and then refreshes it and loads it with prices

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.440
Those three lines and one of them is a slash div. Well, that's pretty cool. Is that insane? Yeah, so

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.920
Yeah, HTMX for the win. Just wanna nice use encourage more people to use that

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:18.040
It lets you do more Python and less JavaScript, right? Cuz most said implementations on the server, which is where it's all Python

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.100
Yeah, and one of those one of those three lines is just the closing of the div

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:26.040
So it's really like two lines of code. It's really like two lines. It's incredible. Yeah

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.380
All right another one so that I've been recently using and some people will be like Michael

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.280
Where have you been all this time? Why have you not done this?

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.460
All I'll put this out to you as I my test candidate

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.180
Did you know that if you're if you find yourself sitting down to the terminal?

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:48.200
SSH into a server running the command and then leaving often even if that has like text output and all sorts of responses

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:55.860
Colored text output like rich or whatever. Yeah, you can just run that on your machine using SSH to execute a command remotely

00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:01.460
This is news to you. No, but so you you say SSH for people who don't know you say SSH

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:05.880
User at host and then in print and quotes some command

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.380
so like if you want to say tail your log and see what's happening on your server instead of

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:15.460
Logging into the server over SSH and tailing it you could just create an alias that says SSH

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.260
User at host do the tail log thing and you just type it locally and just boom you're telling log

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:25.220
Beautiful or whatever you want to do if you want to run multiple commands just separate them by semicolons

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:30.300
Get a little alias for that bad boy and off you go. Yeah nice. So anyway, that's one of my extras

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.820
I use it for

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.540
So the reboot is built in but we we have an extra command that we do for restarting

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.340
They we have an application that we often have to restart. So

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:46.660
Doing a single command SSH and run the restart to restart all the software do that a lot. Yep

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.560
All right. I told you it's extra extra extra. There's still more extras. Okay. Okay

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:57.100
We got time. All right. Yeah, these are short. So polyfill.io is a

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:03.760
CDN I believe for a JavaScript polyfill is if a browser doesn't support a feature

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.140
But you can implement it in JavaScript on top of the features that are there

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:12.980
That's a because include a script that's a polyfill like add features to an old one. Okay, you know brother

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.540
Okay

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:20.060
so apparently according to bleeping computer this thing has been impacted by a supply chain attack where

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:27.620
Chinese company acquired the domain and then the script was modified to redirect users to malicious and scam sites

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.340
Oh and everyone who had that in their web app

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:35.020
100,000 different websites the CDN got a new version of the the script for you

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:40.260
Geez, which means it's time for required reading from Wesley

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:46.380
Aptaker castles reasons to avoid CDNs and JavaScript. I'll do the way I lighted one here

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:51.680
Look systemic risk says one of the CDNs out there supports

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:58.860
12.5% of all websites if that goes down there's having 12.5% of the Internet vanish is silly

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.460
We've swung too far towards away from resiliency

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:08.660
Society privacy obviously because they can track everyone who makes a request that and coordinate that across

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:15.420
Browsers and sites they see speed but I if using a CP to it doesn't that matter that much you could use your own CDN

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.440
Security this points out that modern browsers have

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.660
Sub-resource integrity basically put a hash on to it

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:27.380
And if you're using a CDN put the hash in there that way if something like this happens

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:32.140
It won't load the page like the browsers like no it doesn't match. I'm not running this. Hmm. Just good

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.660
Unfortunately, this doesn't work for libraries that are split into multiple pieces

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:40.080
You know where one thing requires another type of deal as part of it

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.700
So what to do instead just download it is what they say

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.620
Although what we do Brian over at Python bites is we just download it

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.540
But then we serve that content back over our own CDN at bunny.net

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.900
Well, it's not ours, but when we use a bunny.net, which still gives it all the global reach

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.300
But we control whether or not it changes other people. She's awesome

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.900
okay, and just to keep beating the drum and

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.380
major ad networks are basically malware delivering funnels and

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:16.580
Don't feel bad about ad blockers Mac users served info stealer malware through Google Ads. So why not? Who wouldn't want that? Oh geez, so

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:23.500
That's an article on ours technically you can check out but that's my extra extra extra extra extra here all about it

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.800
Okay, nice. You got extras I do but I've got a link that I can't show

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:35.260
Okay, so I want you to go to the like either in the notes or the private chat and click on that link

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:42.100
I will talk about it. It's called I will effing pile drive you if you mentioned AI again, so it's just a

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:49.600
It's a funny reaction to all this ChatGPT stuff and AI and everything and it's interesting

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:55.940
It's the interesting position. So this is somebody that was studying data science there and I think they're in college and

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:01.180
And they're doing grads. I think grad school stuff now doing a master's thesis

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.660
but he's

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:09.700
Kind of sick of a lot of the hype around AI so there's just an interesting take on it and it's it's so funny

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.620
like

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:18.460
If you'd like to have an alternative if you're tired of all the hype around AI and you'd like to you know

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:25.260
Read some somebody else's perspective. Click the link in the show notes and it'll be interesting read for you

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:32.020
The reason why I'm not showing it is because I want to keep this child friendly and safe for the spot for the live feed

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:37.300
So, thanks, right. Well, check it out. That's my that's my only extra

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.420
alright, well

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.620
Lance

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:46.860
Closed to sell the joke, huh? All right. Yeah, let's do that. By the way. I I have this AI fatigue as well

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.140
It's like ChatGPT is cool

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:55.380
Lama three is cool, but like not everything needs to have AI in it and certainly a lot of times

00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:01.700
Software use has just like easiest all persistent bugs because the whole team is like on an AI mission

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.920
You're like, I don't want any of this junk. Could you just make it when I click this that it works?

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.500
Yeah, you know, all right off the joke over on reddit we have

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:15.860
Something called the HTML hacker. We just talked about like the malware, right? So

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:23.160
This is a sort of two sides of the picture. Both people don't see either side really so woman

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.220
She says my boyfriend is a programmer. He'll hack is don't mess with me. My boyfriend is a programmer

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:34.700
He'll hack your world into oblivion. Meanwhile the boyfriend on his computer Google how to declare variables in HTML

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.540
Yeah, yeah

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.780
Both things gonna be true at the same time

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:45.860
He also could be a hacker and still not know to declare variables at HTML you never know

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:52.620
I don't know how to declare variables an issue. Can you declare variables an issue? No, no, okay, but you can in like

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.260
Modern CSS and you know, well, okay

00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.740
So what are the things I think is funny about this because sometimes in the movies you'll see somebody like

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:06.940
pouring through lines of code and then you you look at it and it's it's just like the view source of

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:13.620
Some web page or something. It's like that's not like you're not hacking anything then guys looking at the guys

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.860
I found the source to this web page

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.380
I'm going in

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:27.940
Yeah, well now I've got the JavaScript next oh my gosh, I can't believe they just published this and don't hide it

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:35.300
Yeah, so anyway, that's funny. Yeah. Anyway, all right. That's it. Thanks a lot for great episode

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.740
Yeah, Vaughn, as always.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.740
Catch you later.
