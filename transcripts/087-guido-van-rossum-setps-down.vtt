00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.100
This is episode 87 recorded July 17th, 2018. I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.000
And I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.900
And Brian, we've got a really special episode for some big news here.


00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.800
Yes, and we've got some great guests helping us with this.


00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.400
We do. We have Carol Willing and Brett Cannon both joining us to get somewhat of an inside perspective on this


00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.420
Big, somewhat sad announcement, and we're going to dig into that.


00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.100
Hello, Carol. Welcome to the show.


00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.300
Hi, how are you doing?


00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.940
Great, thanks for being here. Hi, Brett.


00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.780
Hello, everyone. Thanks for having me.


00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.500
Yeah, absolutely. It's great you're here.


00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.140
So before we get into this, I want to just quickly


00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.540
thank Datadog for sponsoring the show and tell you guys quickly about them


00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.820
before we dig into the stuff because there's not a real break.


00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.420
So let me just say thank you to Datadog.


00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.140
If you have infrastructure that you want monitored,


00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.260
if you have multi-tier or multi-server applications,


00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.600
you can plug in Datadog and get distributed tracing,


00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.400
logging, error handling, everything all in one place,


00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.280
14-day free trial, and sign up at pythonbytes.fm/datadog.


00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.920
You'll get a cool Datadog t-shirt.


00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
So thank you for them for sponsoring this episode.


00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.120
Brian, you want to tell us what the big news is?


00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.760
- I think I'm just about as clueless as everybody else.


00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm just in shock.


00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.120
Last week, we heard an announcement


00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.120
that Guido was stepping down as the BDFL.


00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.900
Yeah, that is a big deal.


00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.440
So there's been a little bit of debate about exactly what he meant when he said this,


00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.940
you know, was it he's just taking a break?


00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.040
Is he actually stepping down?


00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.480
So let me just read the salient parts of the announcement.


00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.960
So this was an email sent to the Python mailing list, Python dev mailing list, and the title was transfer a power.


00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.960
And here's Guido's words, bits and pieces taken from his email.


00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.300
Now that PEP 572 is done,


00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.240
I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for a pep


00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.900
and find that so many people despise my decisions.


00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.800
I'd like to remove myself entirely from the decision process.


00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.300
I'll still be here for a while as an ordinary core dev


00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.200
and I'll still be available to mentor people, possibly more


00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.160
available, but I'm basically giving myself a permanent vacation


00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
from being BDFL


00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
and you all will be on your own.


00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
I'm not going to appoint a successor.


00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
The decision, he says basically, summarizing


00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
that the day to day stuff is going to be fine,


00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.280
but the decisions that matter that may be affected are how peps are decided


00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.280
and how new core devs are inducted.


00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.480
And then finally,


00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.000
sort of on the parting thought,


00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.200
said, I'll still be here,


00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.360
but I'm trying to let you all figure something out for yourselves.


00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.360
I'm tired and need a very long break.


00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.960
So that was the announcement and that's the big news.


00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.960
And that's what we're going to talk about today.


00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.160
First, I just want to say thank you to Guido for doing so much for so long,


00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.880
creating one of the most popular programming languages in history.


00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.480
I have publicly said this, I am personally forever indebted to Guido and the team,


00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.680
because they basically taught me how to program for real.


00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.580
I have an official education in all this,


00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.180
but I have always stated that how to actually develop in the real world is entirely down to Guido and the team.


00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.880
Yeah.


00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.380
That's awesome.


00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.380
And I think Guido has done so much, not just for the language, but also for the community as well.


00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.300
And I know I appreciate from the earliest days when he was designing Python,


00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.300
how he made it accessible for learners and for people to actually use the language.


00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.380
And, you know, when I'm teaching people, whether it's with Jupyter or high school students, like I'm teaching this week,


00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.020
it's just a pleasure to do it in Python.


00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.940
And personally, I have a lot to thank him for, but even more so for the greater group of people as well.


00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:58.980
Yeah, I don't know if he specifically set out to set the tone as he did, or if it was it's just Guido being Guido, but I think he definitely deserves a lot of credit for setting the tone that this community has ended up with, as being inclusive and welcoming. And just the basically what makes this community as amazing as it is.


00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Yeah, it's not just technical. I think one of the special things about Python, unlike many languages is


00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.600
there's sort of professional programming languages that can build high end stuff.


00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.680
And there's learning languages that are super basic, but you got to stop


00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.200
to go build real apps with something else later. And this is one of the few languages that you can start simple


00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.280
and finish big with. And so that is really, I think, part of its magic.


00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.360
But also, you know, you go to PyCon and these other conferences, and you look around and the people around you look like


00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.560
more like general society and less like a bunch of white guys.


00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.160
You know what I mean? And to me, that is a really special thing.


00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.060
It really is. It's not as far as it should be, but it is on the path to where


00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.460
it's on a good path. It's unlike other communities that I've been involved in.


00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.260
So I think that's also really important.


00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.760
Well, I think Kim as a person, I think he has his personality has so much to do with it.


00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.560
You mentioned PyCon and one of the things that Guido did


00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.220
at PyCon was I had asked him if he would meet a young man called Joshua Lowe who does


00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.340
Edgeblocks, which is this really cool user interface that lets you go from


00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.440
scratch to Python code. And we were talking about how Joshua had made it


00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.520
over dinner and then the next day Guido probably spent an hour just hacking with


00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.960
him and made this young man's PyCon experience more amazing than it was just the day before.


00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.200
So that's really awesome. Yeah. And Brian, you got to have lunch with him at the last PyCon,


00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.960
right? That was really fun. They did a drawing of people that donated to the Python Software


00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.720
Foundation. They drew a handful of names, and I think there were like six or seven of us


00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.400
have lunch with him. And one of the things that was really interesting at that lunch was


00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.240
we were in around the table and talked about who what everybody does and what their contribution or not to Python was.


00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:04.000
And I talked about some of the things I was doing, you know, mentioned a full time, a full time job, but I also, you know, work on trying to teach testing and


00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:15.960
pytest and other development processes to people. And he looked at me and said, so you, you have got a full day time day job, how do you have enough energy to deal with all the negative


00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.960
feedback you get from contributing to Python.


00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.960
And I haven't really got that negative feedback.


00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.960
And that's what, I guess that was a bizarre, I thought of it as a bizarre question,


00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.960
but now in context it makes a lot of sense.


00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.960
He was at the center of the pressure points, right?


00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.960
That's tough. So let's maybe talk about


00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.960
what some of the root causes for this.


00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.960
Like, he specifically calls out PEP 572


00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.960
in his letter that he sent out.


00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.720
But I feel like there must be more to that like like PEP 572 was the straw


00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.940
Not everything but Carol and Brett you guys are more on the inside. You probably have more exposure to this. What do you think?


00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.740
Honestly, it was the last straw about I don't know what Carol thinks


00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.920
But I personally figured Guido was probably going to retire in the next I don't know


00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.480
two maybe three years


00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:17.600
Just because he's joked so long about retirement and I think he was just getting ready to just not do it and he's been working on


00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.420
Making the projects self-sustaining for quite some time


00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:27.060
But admittedly from my perspective PEP 572 got really nasty


00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:33.500
It was so much negativity that I think he just got fed up and said like look


00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.520
I've been doing this for 28 years. I've been putting up with general negativity as well and this


00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.840
groundswell was just too much to bear and just like forget it I don't want to put up with this anymore I'm gonna as he said


00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.760
He's gonna retire. He's still the bdfl that for life bit is true, but


00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:57.520
He's basically said my last dictatorial declaration is I am not going to make any more dictatorial declarations ever again


00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.600
Have fun


00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.720
Yeah, yeah, but no it got extremely negative like when guido announced the acceptance of the pep


00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.160
The very first tweet at him was too bad. It's a waste of time


00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.520
And that was just a very common occurrence of just nothing but negativity.


00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.680
There wasn't constructive feedback or anything, and it dragged on forever.


00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:26.020
There were some missteps in terms of how it was communicated, in terms of a technical aspect of how it was communicated through the list, like reposting the PEP.


00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:32.160
But people just really just piled it on, and it was just unnecessary.


00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.600
It was just not constructive.


00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.440
And that's as Brian pointed out, that's why he asked that question.


00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.520
How do you handle the negativity?


00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.800
Because there can be a lot of negativity anytime you touch this language.


00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.400
People love it for a reason.


00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.040
And if there's any hints of you changing something that they don't like,


00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.640
some people really overreact.


00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:54.040
And if you saw my keynote at PyCon US, it was entirely on this topic because it


00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.840
can get so overwhelming sometimes when people just jump on you and expect to


00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:07.160
apart used so widely as Python. There's not a small number of people who feel the need to share their opinion. And unfortunately, share it in a


00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:15.720
unconstructive way. And I think it just finally made him just go, yeah, you know what, I don't need to ever put up with this ever again, forget it, and just said, I'm


00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.200
retiring.


00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:28.000
One thought that I had when we were getting ready for this show was, you know, it's kind of related to what Brian said, as well, like, you know, has a full time hectic job at Dropbox, right? He's


00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.360
already fully committed to working on stuff. And then he's trying to bear the, you know,


00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:40.160
significant portion of the weight of people not wanting changes or demanding changes to Python


00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:46.480
in various ways. And, you know, do you, Carol, think it would have been different if the PSF


00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:53.920
had made a space to sort of employ Guido to be in that role and not make it, you know,


00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.760
there's the stress of the experience and there's the stress of these are my final two hours of the


00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.040
day and I'm already exhausted. Now I'm getting this, you know what I mean?


00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.760
I can't speak for Guido, but I mean, I don't know that that would have solved it. I mean,


00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:11.040
I think he has been doing what he wants to be doing. And I think if he had said,


00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.400
"Hey, I want to do this," people would be, you know, very happy to accommodate him. I think


00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.480
largely what Brett had said, you know, we were talking in the office here at Jupyter the other


00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:31.280
day and we were saying we can't believe how long he has shepherded the language and dealt with,


00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.320
you know, people's comments and fostered, you know, the direction of the language.


00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:45.600
And in many ways, any maintainer will feel over time some burnout when there's negativity around


00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:53.560
a project. And I think it's unfortunate that people choose to make things personal when


00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.960
they don't need to be personal, that they view things with black and white as opposed


00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:06.440
to wanting to compromise over something. And I remember when I was facing some burnout


00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.360
and he was one of the people that said to me, "Well, do the things that you really enjoy,


00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.760
electronics and teaching and is really helpful advice.


00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.720
So I think maybe he's taking some of his own advice.


00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.840
- Yeah, it has been a really long time


00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.680
that he's been working on this.


00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.680
So I've never worked on a single project for 30 years, right?


00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.320
I've not been programming for 30 years, honestly.


00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.120
But it just seems like, you know,


00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.280
it's pretty natural for him to step down.


00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.680
One thing I really wish,


00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.320
and Brian, I think we spoke about this last time.


00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.080
I wish he would have just sort of gone into a more,


00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.360
I'm kind of stepping back for a while and hung in there until after 2020


00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.480
and Python 3 becomes the one and only Python.


00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.760
And sort of that could have been like a celebratory stepping down


00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.280
rather than I'm frustrated and I'm giving you guys the reins.


00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.960
I would have liked to see him retire in some sort of celebration,


00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.360
mission accomplished type of experience, you know?


00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.760
It would have been nice, but the problem is,


00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.560
is there still the chance of another,


00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.280
I don't think uprising is quite the right word,


00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.160
but an explosion of negativity between now and then.


00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.000
And while I would like to assume the community has switched over to three,


00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.520
and every number I've seen has said that,


00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.320
I also don't know if the people who are holding onto Python 2 are going to


00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.200
react reasonably come January 1st, 2020 as well.


00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.280
So I could also see him going like, you know what,


00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.960
I don't want to risk having to put myself through that after what he's just gone


00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.320
through. Yeah, that's possible.


00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.040
I totally get the perspective of it would have been an amazing party.


00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.080
January 1st, we're at PyCon in 2020 going like,


00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.380
"Yeah, we've moved on to Python 3.


00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.540
Guido's getting the well-deserved retirement he wants,


00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.040
and it would have been an amazing party,


00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.280
but instead we're just going to have just the amazing party for Python 3."


00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.940
And I'm personally fine with that.


00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.740
We can invite Guido. I'm sure he'll be there.


00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.940
I don't think that that...


00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.740
I mean, he's still the president of the PSF,


00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.140
so he obviously is still going to be involved.


00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.540
And, you know, it's up to us as the community,


00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.920
Much like the SciPy community did last week, they did a really nice


00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.600
"Thank you, Guido." They got everybody from the conference together


00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.640
and gave them a very thoughtful "Thank you," which I've never seen them do for


00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:25.400
anything before, so it was really cool. I think he has touched so many people


00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.520
in so many different ways that that celebration will come. I think


00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.600
looking at it, I don't know that there's ever an easy way


00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.360
to change how you make decisions and governance


00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.640
when you have many personalities involved.


00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:48.120
And it's unfortunate how it came out, but I think there had to be something


00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.440
that would give us a catalyst in the developer community


00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.040
to really take some of these issues on that


00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.200
are not necessarily new issues to us. He's been asking us to do it for quite a


00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.280
while and we just haven't either had the


00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.600
the bandwidth or the sort of kick in the pants


00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.000
to actually go and do it.


00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.520
- So we're all kind of like the 29 year old kids


00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.040
still living at home and Guido's like,


00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.800
"Get out, go live on your own, take care of yourselves."


00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.140
- A little bit, yeah.


00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.720
- All right, so you spoke about governance


00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.000
and decision making and stuff.


00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Like what do you think is gonna replace


00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.640
Guido being the final decider?


00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.040
- It's actually still being actively discussed.


00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.860
As the email Guido sent said,


00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.180
he's basically leaving it up to us.


00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:38.100
He did not dictate how we were going to govern ourselves afterwards.


00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.100
So he has left it up to us.


00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:44.140
He actually didn't even dictate how we would even choose how we would choose to govern


00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.140
ourselves.


00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:50.300
So there's not even a specific choice yet of how we would potentially vote for this.


00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.780
Like some people have said PSF fellows, some have said core devs.


00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.220
So there's, it's a completely open-ended question, honestly.


00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:06.180
The current thinking seems to be around, and Carol can obviously correct me if my feeling


00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:14.020
doesn't jive with hers at all, either potentially another BDFL or a somehow council of elders


00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.420
or some such.


00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.740
It seems to be the key thing is just trying to figure out how we want to steward the design


00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.740
of the language.


00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:25.140
We've been managing ourselves daily for quite some time.


00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.140
and Guido's not directly involved with releases,


00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.280
so that's not even an issue.


00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.660
It really comes down to how do we have someone


00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.100
make the final decision on PEPs?


00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.420
Who says yay or nay?


00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.780
Who makes the technical decisions?


00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.900
Who chooses the paint color for the bike shed?


00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.020
That kind of thing.


00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.500
That's the really key thing


00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.100
we have to still make a decision on.


00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.700
>> Yeah, and I think Brett kind of put it,


00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.780
you know, I think the emails that I've at least seen


00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.540
on Python committers have been very respectful


00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:58.980
and really trying to seek out what is going to happen from here.


00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.320
And I think Guido's email mentioned four things,


00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.160
day-to-day decisions on the issue tracker and GitHub,


00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.120
how peps are decided, which to me is sort of like the direction of the language


00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.000
and who stewards that, how new core devs are inducted,


00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.600
and the code of conduct.


00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.440
And if I look at all four of those,


00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.480
the day-to-day decisions, as Brett had said,


00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.880
releases and things like that, we're in a good spot,


00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.640
and we should probably just be doing what we have been doing.


00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.080
How new core devs are inducted,


00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.080
I think that will fall out of whatever decision-making


00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.320
we have for the language.


00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.040
I know that we've made some progress


00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.080
over the past couple of years,


00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.600
and I continue to see that we will make progress.


00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.760
And the code of conduct,


00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.200
I think we're all recognizing that being professional


00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.260
and civil to each other and talking about issues


00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.960
as opposed to whether somebody's intelligence


00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.400
gets called into question or whatever


00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.040
is not the right way to do it.


00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.080
It's better to be professional.


00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.520
And how PEPs are decided, it seems as if,


00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.080
much like Brett had mentioned,


00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.360
that we're sort of converging on maybe three individuals


00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.360
as like a triumvirate or one and no more than five


00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.720
is sort of how I've read it.


00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.560
- Okay, that makes a lot of sense.


00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.360
It seems to me whatever the decision is,


00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.040
it should be odd, not even.


00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.780
- Actually that came up already and Tim Peters,


00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.480
for those of you who've been in language for a long time,


00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.040
might recognize the name, who's gotten active again,


00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.820
partially thanks to PEP 572.


00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.640
So at least there's one very nice perk from my perspective


00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.240
from what happened with PEP 572,


00:17:44.240 --> 00:18:07.760
pointed out that the odd number in voting typically is very important when you have an either A or B decision, and you have to choose one or the other. But if you have a status quo or a change, so more of a yes, no decision, having the tie go to the status quo is not quite so critical. So we could theoretically go with a four and really not have too much of an impactful problem in that regard.


00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.960
Yeah, I guess it would lead to stronger debates.


00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.400
You've got to bring someone over to your side if it's a split decision.


00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.760
And if they fail to decide, then it just stays the way it is.


00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.600
Right? Nothing new is adopted, I guess.


00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.880
Yeah, exactly. So there is the possibility of actually going with four, for instance.


00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.280
Interesting.


00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.040
I don't think anyone suggested two.


00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:31.000
It seems to be pretty much one, three, four, five seems to be the running numbers right now.


00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.560
Right.


00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.440
Yeah. Interesting. Okay. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.


00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:42.760
So I guess the final thing that we should spend some time on is, is this a problem for the community? Is this


00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:58.280
is this going to hurt Python's fantastic momentum? Is this going to hurt the growth or evolution or sustaining Python? Or do you think it's just a little bit of change on how decisions are made and not such a big deal?


00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.680
Do you want me to take that first, Brett?


00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.880
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.


00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.920
You go first, Carol.


00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.280
So I think the language will continue to thrive and will continue to grow.


00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.600
Will some things be different? Yes. But Guido's made it very clear.


00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.240
He's still going to be accessible on mailing lists.


00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.440
He's still the president of the PSF.


00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.440
The PSF is largely with the community support,


00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:25.160
doing many of the outreach things and things to grow the community.


00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.600
And then the core development side of things,


00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:34.660
I think what you've seen is sort of a shift in some ways away from strictly the language


00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:39.580
to also, you know, Python has a very rich ecosystem of libraries.


00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:45.760
So things like Jupyter and SciPy and NumPy wouldn't have come about if Python, the core


00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.620
language hadn't been so wonderful to work with.


00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.860
And so, yes, there was going to be work to do to figure out how to continue the design


00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:02.020
of the language, but I have every belief and commitment that that will happen.


00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:07.060
I agree. I think the way I don't think this is going to change the momentum for the language,


00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:14.660
I don't think honestly anyone should really be worried at all. There might be a slowdown


00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:20.100
in terms of new features for Python 3.8, which I know some people actually like the idea of.


00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:28.740
basically, I view it no more as a temporary pause in language defining changes. And honestly,


00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:34.420
we've had a language moratorium before back for Python 3.3, I believe, which I should know,


00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:40.100
since I helped write the PEP for that. So if anything, you can view it as basically just


00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.740
a moratorium on language changes for a little while until we decide how we want to govern


00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.660
those kinds of changes. And then it'll just more or less go back to where it was. Now,


00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:56.020
the pace might be slower than it was if for instance we go with a council versus a another


00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:02.260
dictate benevolent dictator who could potentially come to decisions faster and just do other things


00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:08.500
like it's potentially more nimbly in my personal view but I really don't see this really affecting


00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.460
the language long term or even medium term or basically short-term defending on your definition


00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.180
of short yeah for some definition of short yeah I suspect we'll have this all worked out in the


00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.940
the next few months. I'd be really surprised if we don't have a solid plan


00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.060
of what our options are by the end of the year, and if not already


00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.020
decided by then.


00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:31.060
Now I've got a hopefully a quick question. I guess I don't know how, when


00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:36.580
there's discussions on on PEPS, who can participate in those discussions? Is it


00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.220
just core developers?


00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.940
I have to caveat this with this was the way it used to be.


00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.420
We'll see if this continues, but to answer that question, Brian, basically the


00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:52.020
way we suggest people do peps is they come with an idea to Python ideas the


00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.500
mailing list and they propose it and usually pretty quickly people either go


00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:01.380
that's been proposed before no that's not doesn't seem very Pythonic or there's


00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:07.020
that seems like a possibly good idea and Guido did occasion come in and say yes


00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:11.580
there's a possibility for this or shuts would shut an idea down quickly so


00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.900
people didn't waste their time and then usually they have a discussion work out


00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:21.500
some rough details and then usually the proposer goes away and comes back with a rough PEP saying


00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.740
all right here's a more formal proposal and then more discussion on Python ideas to help that


00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:31.660
author refine it and then what they would do is they would then bring that to Python dev and then


00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:38.060
with more or less a finalized PEP and then any final salient details would be worked out and then


00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:45.580
either Guido would name what we called a BDFL delegate who would be someone he delegated the


00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.140
final decision to in terms of technical details and also whether the PEP would be accepted,


00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:55.500
or he would keep the BDFL vote himself and he would eventually make the call.


00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:02.460
One change that has been floated though is to take a PEP from Python ideas to Python dev,


00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:08.620
you might start needing more of a co-sponsor from a core developer to help make sure that the idea


00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.540
seems solid enough to bring forward and also to make sure the PEP is in a good position because


00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:25.100
One of the problems with PEP 572 was, while the idea was there, the PEP wasn't fully fleshed out to the level that we typically have PEPs from Python ideas on dev as.


00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:33.260
And so there was a lot of repetitious discussion of things that should have been recorded initially in the PEP to have tamped down on the repeated discussion.


00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:39.980
Because the discussion of Python ideas actually was a bit more reasonable than it was on Python dev and less reactionary, funny enough.


00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:46.180
So that's generally the process is idea to Python ideas, then a rough PEP and then refine it.


00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:58.280
And then once it's fairly refined, goes to Python dev, final discussion, and then either Guido or a named BFL delegate made a decision and the PEP either got accepted or rejected.


00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.280
And that's basically the way it was.


00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:06.980
Is there a point in that process where the rest of the community can, I guess, add to the opinion or?


00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.860
So yes, Python ideas is a completely open mailing list. Python dev is also a completely open mailing


00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:16.980
list. So none of these discussions are happening behind closed doors at all. The only mailing list,


00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.380
honestly, that is in any way closed in any of this process is Python committers,


00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.420
and that is more technical details that only affect Python core developers themselves and


00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.900
not peps. So none of these discussions happen in such a fashion that outsiders--


00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:36.900
outsiders is a bad term. People who happen not to be core developers are always able to


00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:43.020
bring forward their opinion. The part of the trick though is not having people


00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:47.440
suddenly pop in and leave their opinion without checking what other people have


00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.740
said or come in and not understanding how to be professional about leaving


00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.280
their opinion. So there's always a balancing act of trying to ask too


00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.860
widely of people who don't quite understand the norms of how to


00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:04.020
communicate well honestly. But none of the conversation is closed off such that


00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.180
people can't participate. So for instance, Brian, if we had a


00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.660
testing oriented one, you're totally happy to come in and


00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.700
participate, whether it's at the nebulous stage and Python ideas


00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.820
or drafting up that path, or Python dev, where it's very much


00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.420
more finalized, like very honing into the technical details of


00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.260
how this would work and really thinking through the


00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.260
ramifications and really focus focus discussion before final


00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.460
decisions made. Okay, but as I said, this is how it was, I


00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.220
don't know how we're going to tweak. Yeah, that makes a lot of


00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.580
sense. Yeah, and it should more or less be the same going


00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.380
forward, it just might, we might start being a bit stricter about when peps move from my


00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:43.980
Python ideas to Python dev to try to make sure the discussion doesn't get rehashed. And as Carol


00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.060
pointed out, this is kind of brought forward some code of conduct issues that will probably,


00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:55.900
I know I'm personally working towards refining and have been since PyCon to help try to push


00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:01.500
even harder to keep the discussion civil. Right. And I think in addition to just the civility of


00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.140
the discussions, one of the things that I want to look at is can we use some of the


00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:14.140
great stuff that we have in natural language processing and pull out like the most meaningful


00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:20.780
content when it comes to comments? And, you know, part of the issue with 572, there were so many


00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:28.780
comments that you had to kind of read them all if you wanted like the full spectrum. And not all of


00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.380
of us have time to do that.


00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.540
And so, you know, a way to condense


00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.100
or shorten the period of comments or something.


00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.620
And that's as much a social issue


00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:43.700
and in some ways a conduct issue as it is a technical issue.


00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.100
- Yeah, that'd be something like in my own community,


00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.720
for instance, in like physical communities,


00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.980
everybody is welcome to attend the open city council


00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.140
meetings, but hardly anybody does.


00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.500
However, when there's a change that affects everybody,


00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.880
that's usually posted somewhere.


00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.320
And then there's like a period of open


00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.560
for community comment or something.


00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.400
I'm not saying we need to do that with Python,


00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.880
but I agree with this somewhat,


00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.320
maybe a curated or rough read or some cliff notes version


00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.160
of the discussion up till now before somebody can jump in.


00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.720
- Yeah, and that's definitely something


00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.920
that's been talked about.


00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.680
- All that puts work on the Python community itself also


00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.520
to do that, that's work as well.


00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.800
- Yeah, and actually historically,


00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.560
the PEP was supposed to capture all of these details,


00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.520
like the rejected idea and open discussion,


00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.760
open idea section in every PEP was meant to act


00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.360
as a running summary of the discussion to help prevent that.


00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.080
But for instance, in the case of PEP 572,


00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.360
it was a bit overwhelming on the volume


00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.600
and it can be hard to do that.


00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.360
So as Carol mentioned, there's discussion going on now


00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.120
about how we can potentially help alleviate that load


00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.900
on the pip author while making sure that


00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.460
that kind of thing is taken care of.


00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.320
- Yeah, it sounds like there's some community stuff


00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.480
to do as well, but I have faith that you guys


00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.700
will figure something out in terms of the voting


00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.420
and the decision-making.


00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.340
And I guess I wanna sort of echo Carol's thought


00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.900
in when I ask about the momentum.


00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.020
So much of Python's momentum is with the ecosystem


00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.300
and the extra libraries and PyPI and all of these things.


00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.340
And honestly, if the language didn't change one bit


00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.660
for five years, I still think there would be massive momentum


00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.500
in the community.


00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.260
So I don't see a real danger here.


00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.100
- Not at all.


00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:40.620
And honestly, I think the momentum's due to the community


00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.340
and Guido has helped shepherd it forward


00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.540
and bring it to where it is.


00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.580
But I think at this point, the language,


00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.980
the language in the community built around it


00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.820
is honestly bigger than Guido at this point.


00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.460
So while we'll all miss Guido immensely


00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.460
and his contribution was very important,


00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.340
I don't think the community should worry


00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.300
because the community itself


00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.700
is gonna be what carries this forward.


00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.380
- Yeah, and I think a lot of the core developers,


00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.740
as well as community members,


00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.420
are gonna ask themselves,


00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.800
hopefully before they post messages and things,


00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.280
like, what would Guido have said?


00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.980
What would Guido think?


00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.380
You know, put yourself, write your email messages


00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.060
like you're the BDFL and have to convince people.


00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.260
I think there are some people that are very articulate


00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.920
and have great ideas and add a lot to improving it.


00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.660
You know, I think the PEP didn't get improved


00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.260
from beginning to end,


00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.720
but it's taxing when you have to slog


00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.940
through the negativity.


00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.260
And I think what Brett is saying, like,


00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.700
hey, let's up our game so that the people


00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.620
who are doing the bulk of the work


00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:51.220
aren't getting negativity thrown at them


00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.780
when there should be collaboration and,


00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.900
hey, this is for the greater good of the language.


00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.940
You don't have to use it or trust.


00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.660
I think trust is a big part of it.


00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.640
Trust that the people who are making the decisions


00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.040
are being good stewards for the language.


00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.860
And I think that the discussion that I've seen so far,


00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.600
I think most people are doing that


00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.960
and will continue to do that.


00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.960
- Yeah, I think that was already mostly there.


00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.860
It's just, it is sad that this put the final straw


00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.420
on Toguito, but thanks to him for everything that he has done


00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.920
I think this may be a good place to leave it.


00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.340
Brett, Carol, you guys want to have some final parting


00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.180
thoughts on this whole idea?


00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.280
Anything else you want to add before we call it a show?


00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.120
- Not really.


00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.340
I think we've pretty much, as we said,


00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.260
don't need to panic, keep on coding.


00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.440
I think we're gonna move past this with no real issue.


00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.460
Obviously, thanks to Guido, as we've all said,


00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.060
and hopefully, while it's sad that Guido's retiring,


00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.540
hopefully we can learn some lessons


00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:56.000
from why it came about when it did,


00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.340
and be better for it coming out the other end.


00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.260
- Yeah, absolutely. Carol?


00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.540
- I agree with what Brett said,


00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.820
and I also think the surprise may still come.


00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.260
Guido is not going away.


00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.060
he may be more focusing on things that rock his world


00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.040
that he sort of put on hold


00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.120
while he shepherded the design


00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.160
and decision-making of the language.


00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:24.160
And I think there's still some Gito surprises yet to come.


00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.920
And I look forward to that.


00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.480
And I just thank him for being an amazing person


00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.520
as well as a great language developer.


00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.120
- Yeah, I totally agree with that.


00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.200
- He actually has not disappeared.


00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.200
He actually just replied to some emails yesterday


00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.080
today about PEP 44, which is type hints.


00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.600
So he's still actively engaged.


00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.720
So he definitely is not disappeared off the map.


00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.560
>> Yeah. >> Nice.


00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.600
Well, if I could throw some ideas out there,


00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.960
Python WebAssembly browser,


00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.520
just going to leave that there if he wants to,


00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.760
you know, try something new.


00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.800
(laughing)


00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.720
Brian, anything else?


00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.440
>> Yeah, I just wanted the,


00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.440
just the obvious heads up of,


00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.840
if you've got a negative reaction about something


00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.160
or some feeling of entitlement,


00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.680
you sleep on it, you know, don't hit the keyboard right away.


00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.440
Try to talk to people online as if you were talking to them in person.


00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:18.280
And, again, if you haven't watched, the Brett's talk from 2018


00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.600
PyCon go watch it cause, it was an eye opener for me.


00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.560
How similar was that to your PyCascades one, Brett?


00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.440
Pretty much the same.


00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:31.240
It was my PyCascades talk became my PyCon US keynote talk.


00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:31.640
Yeah.


00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.680
So definitely people should watch that.


00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.340
I think it sets the right tone for things.


00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.400
I'll put that in the show notes.


00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.240
- Awesome.


00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.640
- All right, thank you all for being here.


00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.080
It's really, I think it's important to spend some time


00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.120
talking about this and just sort of getting


00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.020
that inside information out for everyone in the community.


00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.800
And I think we're gonna be fine, so let's carry on, huh?


00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.080
- That sounds good.


00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:52.920
- All right, bye everyone.


00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.760
- Bye. - Bye.


00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.280
