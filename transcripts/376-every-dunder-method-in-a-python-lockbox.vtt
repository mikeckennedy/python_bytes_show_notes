00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
- Hello and welcome to Python Bytes

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.280
where we deliver Python news and headlines

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.480
directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.480
This is episode 376, recorded March 26th, 2024.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.520
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.840
- And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.440
- And this episode is brought to you all by Scout APM.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.880
I'll tell you more about them later.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.520
We appreciate the support.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.960
Connect with all of us, Brian, me,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.560
and the podcast over on fosstodon.org

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.960
or mastodon more broadly.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.600
Links at the top of your podcast player show notes.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.520
Join us live if you like.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.920
We typically do this on Tuesdays at 10 a.m. Pacific time.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.200
Why is time so hard, Brian?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.040
Why is it so hard?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.120
(laughing)

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.080
Just go to pythonbytes.fm/live to be part of the audience.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.160
See the older shows.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.840
All the older ones are there

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.180
and they are typically the same thing we ship.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.600
We don't really overly edit it or anything

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.320
other than we do clean them up, tighten them up a little.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.800
So if you like the ones with bloopers included,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.200
you can check that out there.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200
I wonder if I was a search engine

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.080
and I was trying to find bloopers,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.200
would there be a way to not let me find them?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.240
What do you think, Brian?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.760
- Well, I hope.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.640
We're trying.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.880
Actually, yeah, I was thinking about this.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.840
I kind of think that the AI stuff

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.400
should have the best content out there to read from,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.800
but companies are making money from that

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.640
and I'm not making, like my blog posts,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.680
I'm not getting any money from that.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.520
If I care about that, how do I stop them?

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.960
So Jeff Triplett is thinking about that too.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.920
So he wrote up a blog post called onrobots.txt.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.920
So the idea was robots.txt is to stop like search engines

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.760
and stuff like that.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.200
But I don't actually wanna stop search engines.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.000
I want search engines to find my stuff.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240
I just don't want the AI stuff.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.760
So Jeff's been thinking about this.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.140
I've been thinking about it also.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.440
So he collected a few links around this.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.840
And one of the things here is I spent a lot of time

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.920
thinking about robots.txt.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.560
In theory, it helps control what search engines

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.200
and AI scrapers are allowed to visit,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.820
but I need more confidence in its effectiveness

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.680
in this post AI apocalyptic world.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.160
I love that.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.020
Anyway, so there's a bunch of, these cropping up.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.680
There's a lot of new stuff going on.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.000
So Jeff has decided to use Django robots,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.440
but let's look at some of the links that he included.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.840
So thanks, Jeff.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.840
So there's block the bots that feed AI models

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.460
by scraping your website.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.320
So there's an article by Neil Clark

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.080
that has an example robots.txt.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.760
And the idea is almost all of these different AI bots,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.040
you've got to block them individually.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.240
So you got to set up these different rules there.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.160
So it'd be good to keep track of some of these places.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.040
Maybe, hopefully he keeps this up,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.760
but there's also an article,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.960
go ahead and block web crawlers,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.200
discussing why you might.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.920
And then a dark visitors,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.360
I think this is gonna be one to keep track of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.760
that it might, hopefully they keep it up.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.360
But there's a big list of known AI bots to block.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.520
And so maybe keeping up on this might be a good idea

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.040
if you care about it.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.040
The Jeff's note was that he added it to the website Django.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.140
There's a couple of different articles

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.620
about adding robots.txt to a Django website.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.720
There's one by Will Vincent and one by Adam Johnson,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.580
both biggies in the Django community.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.080
So we'll link to those.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.840
And like I said at the beginning,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.680
Jeff said he went with a plugin called Django robots

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.360
to populate that and control it through his admin interface.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.960
So there's a lot there.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.640
One of the things not included is my blog is run by Hugo,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.220
run with Hugo.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.160
Anyway, so we're also link,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.920
I'm gonna also link to a how to add robots.txt

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.000
to your Hugo site, if you wanna do that.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.840
- Oh, nice.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.920
I don't think I've messed with my Hugo robots.txt.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.740
- I have not yet, but I think I might.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.080
And I guess I wanted to ask some questions

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.040
before we moved on.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.840
One is as a community,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.840
I think that there should be an easier way to say,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.040
don't scrape this if you're an AI,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.520
other than listing each one,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.120
we should have a standard for that.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.280
But what do you think of this?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.320
Should, as a content creator, should I care about that?

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.000
Should I, I mean, would you?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.800
- You know, it's such an interesting question.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.240
I think it's pretty fraught, right?

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.920
On one hand, I don't wanna feed the AIs either, necessarily.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.320
I think that it's super awesome

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.960
that you could go to ChatGPT and say things like,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.560
you know, what does Python,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.640
what does Talk Python think about this?

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.280
Or, you know, write me a summary of this

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.040
in the style of a Talk Python interview.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.840
Like that's, is that harming me?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.120
No, probably not.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.200
Is it creating some cool aspect,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.200
like halo of the content creation side?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.400
The fact that ChatGPT knows about those kinds of things,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.080
that's kind of cool.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.000
I kind of on the plus side.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.840
I don't know.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.680
I mean, we have--

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.080
- For you, a lot of your content is,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.400
I mean, your open content is open,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.000
but you're a lot of your content's behind a paywall

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.840
with a Talk Python training.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.160
If somebody were to throw all of those trainings

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
into a AI model.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.920
- Yeah, that would be different, right?

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.880
- Yeah, so.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.240
- Yeah, I mean, I certainly have a no robot,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.320
no index settings on certain aspects of the site there.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.360
It's also behind accounts and logins.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.040
So somebody would have to be kind of maliciously doing that,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.240
which I imagine that's probably already been done,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.160
but it is, yeah, that's a different kind of deal.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.720
You know, I mean, maybe the biggest case of this

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.720
is the link tax that Australia, Spain, and Canada

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.480
all tried to put onto the search engines

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.200
and Facebook and social platforms, right?

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.600
Like, I'm getting this right.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.520
I think it's Canada.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.360
They all blur together,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.800
but you know, Canada is the most recent one of these

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.600
for sure, and they passed a law saying,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.640
well, if one of these big American companies

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.520
wants to send traffic, we talked about this,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.160
want to send traffic to one of our news sites,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.320
then they have to pay them for the right of doing that.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.280
Maybe it is.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.880
- Well, it's like kind of like Google News or something.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.640
- I think it's Australia.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.160
I think it was Facebook.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.760
I'm sorry, folks, if I'm like crossing over companies.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.960
I think Facebook just declined to renew their agreements

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.000
with the Australian newspapers and saying, you know what?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.400
We're not gonna send any more traffic

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.760
and we're not gonna allow any links to you whatsoever.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.920
And that's gonna be a negative

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.680
for those news companies as well, right?

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.400
The fact that, I mean, they kind of had the shady deal

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.400
where Facebook would summarize a little bit.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.640
So like, maybe you don't need to click the link to go to it,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.520
but now they're gonna have no links whatsoever

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.040
and they're not gonna be in a better place

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.880
because of that either.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.240
So it's really this, you know,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.000
damned if you do, damned if you don't type of thing

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.120
is what I'm trying to get at.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.720
And like the biggest example of that playing out

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.240
is with these news organizations

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.080
and the social media and search engines.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.160
- Yeah, yeah, except for, I don't know,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.320
the AIs, I don't think they're linking back

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.320
to the original content.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.240
- No, you got a good point there

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.760
that at least search engines and stuff and social media,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.320
they credit you, they send traffic to you.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.280
Whereas we're gonna have to reckon

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.600
with the AI stuff in some way,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.000
because it just says, here's the answer.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And how did it get it?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.080
I don't know, maybe that's your answer repurposed.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.920
Who knows, right?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.200
But you get zero credit for that.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.160
- Right, anyway. - That's a good point.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.920
We're not probably gonna solve that today.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.760
Maybe next week.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.880
Wanna come back and solve it next week?

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.720
- Yeah, sure.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.680
- Well, if you were to be automating requests

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.880
to these websites, what is the most popular way to do that?

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.720
Well, it's right in the name, requests.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.720
And requests by Kenneth Wrights has been migrated over.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.200
It's like so popular,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.080
it's migrated over to the PSF itself, right?

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.840
I don't remember where it said,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.360
yeah, it actually still has it says,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.720
request is one of the most downloaded Python packages today,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.440
pulling in around 30 million downloads a week.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.280
- Wow.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.840
- Used by over a million repositories on GitHub.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.040
You can probably trust it.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.960
But there are things that it doesn't do,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.120
things that it's not necessarily wanting

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.240
to like lead the bleeding edge on.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.040
I mean, just with that amount of usage,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.280
you gotta be careful, right?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.480
So I'm gonna point you at a fork of requests,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.360
nyquests, I'm not sure, hopefully,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.560
niquests instead of request, ni.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.680
I'm not sure I'm getting the reference here.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.080
There's probably some cleverness to the name

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.160
and I'm sorry for not getting it there, Java.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.960
So anyway, it says requests,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.320
but with HTTP/3, HTTP/2, multiplexed connections.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.160
So if you're downloading,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.960
you could create multiple connections to the server

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.960
and download multiple streams.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.160
I think that's what that means.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.480
System certificate authorities, certificate revocation.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.440
So if you wanna control like what certificates you trust,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.720
maybe there's some that have been known

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.760
to be doing bad things,

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.880
or you just don't wanna allow access

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.120
to certain parts of the internet,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.200
you can revoke those certificates

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.920
and their authorities and so on.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.480
DNS over HTTPS, TLS and QUIC.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.160
So if you wanna have better control over how DNS works,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.360
if you wanna escape what DNS is happening on your server

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.600
and explicitly control it from your application,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600
you can do that securely, which is awesome.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.880
Has async and await, DNS security,

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.880
and there's much pain removed, which is cool.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.120
So anyway, this is a pretty interesting thing.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.280
If you know requests, you basically know this,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.160
except for that it also has async versions,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.040
which is kinda cool.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.560
But yeah, it's got like a great long feature list

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.480
and why they did this.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.040
Yeah, so worth looking at, I think.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.360
- Yeah, definitely.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.280
That's pretty cool.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.560
- Yeah, but a lot of those things like the certificate stuff

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.800
or DNS over HTTPS or DNS security are areas

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.040
you're like, if we really need that,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.440
as most people probably don't,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.200
but if you do, this looks pretty cool.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.960
- Yeah, I think it's, I think my guess is that the name

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.480
is based on the Knights of Nii,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.600
so it'd be NiiQuests, I think.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.360
- NiiQuests, all right, let's go with it, NiiQuests.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.920
- Yeah, because of course we have those themes, right?

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.760
- Yeah, yeah.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.040
- Of course we do.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.000
Now, Brian, we do have a sponsor for this episode, right?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.600
- Yay. - Yay.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.320
Let me tell you real quick about ScoutAPM.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.080
They're big supporters of Python Bytes,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.960
so we appreciate that very much.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.840
So if you are tired of spending hours

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.800
trying to find the root cause of issues

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.080
impacting your performance,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.120
then you owe it to yourself to check out ScoutAPM.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.000
They're a leading Python application

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.920
performance monitoring tool, APM,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.520
that helps you identify and solve

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.400
performance abnormalities faster and easier.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.440
ScoutAPM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.360
slow database queries, background jobs,

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.360
and the dreaded N+1 queries that you can end up

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.240
if you do lazy loading in your ORM,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.520
and then you say, "Oh no, why is it so slow?

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.820
"Why are you doing 200 database queries

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.500
"for what should be one?"

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.920
So you can find out things like that.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.640
And it links it back directly to source code,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.840
so you can spend less time in the debugger

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.600
and peeling logs and just finding the problems

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.560
and moving on.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.960
And you'll love it because it's built

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.480
for developers by developers.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.280
It makes it easy to get set up.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.600
Seriously, you can do it in less than four minutes,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.520
so that's awesome.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.080
And the best part is the pricing is straightforward.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.520
You only pay for the data that you use

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.600
with no hidden overage fees or per seat pricing.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.480
And I just learned this, Brian,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.600
they also have, they provide the pro version

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.680
for free to all open source projects.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.560
So if you're an open source maintainer

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.400
and you want to have Scout APM for that project,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.860
just shoot them a message or something

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.540
on their pricing page about that.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.080
So you can start your free trial

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.240
and get instant insights today.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.800

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.240
The link is in your podcast player show notes as well.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.160
And please use that link.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.960
Don't just search for them because otherwise,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.320
they don't think you came from us.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.720
And then they'd stop supporting the show.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.440
So please use our link, pythonbytes.fm/scout.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.300
Check them out.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.400
It really supports the show.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.240
Indeed, indeed.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.520
Thank you, Brian.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.520
Yeah, let's talk about--

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.140
Underscore has some funky meanings in Python.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.980
It's kind of fun.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.280
We love the underscore.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.120
Yeah.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.160
Like I'm gonna get a new keyboard,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.440
like on my keyboard here,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.120
it has two independent buttons for the space key.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.960
I'm gonna make this one just the underscore.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.200
(laughing)

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.360
Okay, sure, you can do that.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.680
And you'll probably need it--

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.680
What could I do with it?

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.840
You could, because of all of the dunder methods,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.320
we have so many underscores

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.080
that we called two_dunders in Python.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.200
So, and what are all these dunder methods for?

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.600
So Trey Hunter has actually put together

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.680
this really cool resource,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.400
every dunder method in Python.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.760
And actually, I mean, I thought I knew quite a few,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.400
and I use probably repper and str, probably the most,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.040
to make sure that my objects are representable

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.120
or convertible to strings.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.440
But there's quite a few more.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.760
And so he goes through,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.180
like here's our essentials for a repper and,

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.560
oh, he calls equality essential,

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.600
but I don't really,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.280
I guess maybe I don't make my own custom data types

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.960
as often as maybe I should.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.220
But there's the equal, EQ, that does equality,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.320
and then repper that converts to rep.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.440
And it's also used with str

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.920
if you didn't have a str method,

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.280
but you can have those be separate.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.800
So the other one that's common is dunder init

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.960
for how you initialize classes,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.320
which, to be honest, I use probably adders

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.720
and data classes more than custom data classes.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.760
So I don't really write that myself a lot,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.240
but I often use it in initializing my,

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.320
another class if I derive from something else.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.600
Anyway, moving on, there's tons.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.120
He's got equality and hashability.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.160
Hashability is important if you're creating an object

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.000
that should be hashable, that way you can create,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.880
why do you care about that?

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.000
You care about hashability

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.560
because that means your objects can be used,

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.040
if they're hashable, they can be used for,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.280
I think there's some other rules too,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.760
but you can use them for keys to dictionaries.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.920
So, and there's tons of dictionaries in Python.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.680
So we've got- - Maybe also sets.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.480
I'm not sure, I can't remember about sets.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.320
- Maybe. - Maybe.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.200
- Yeah, probably, yeah.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.760
But you also need to equal,

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.840
I think there's less than you need also.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.960
Anyway, there's orderability,

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.160
so you've got less than or greater than and all that.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.280
Type conversions and formatting, tons around that.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.040
- You don't think about type conversions that much, right?

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.920
Because you don't think about Sting

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.160
and all that stuff in Python as much.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.680
- Right, but it is kind of cool.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.000
I didn't know that, I guess I knew you could do this,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.160
but I kind of forgot that you can,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.400
so if you say like int of something or bool of something,

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.000
if that makes sense for your data type,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.280
you can write your own dunder method

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:55.120
so that people can just use the built-in type conversion,

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.840
which is pretty cool.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.480
I didn't know about this format thing,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.080
so that you can use the f-strings appropriately

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.440
if you've got the format.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.600
- I think you can pass modifiers from the S string.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.280
So like with a floating point number,

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.680
you can say like- - Oh, it's for the modifier.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.000
- Colon, comma, point two F,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.440
and it'll be like comma separated, two decimal.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.720
I think you can take your own format specifier there.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.800
I think that's what that's for.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.720
- Okay, I'll have to research that a little bit more.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.720
Anyway, the dunder methods around context managers,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.600
which is actually kind of a funny thing.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.720
I think that I've read a lot of tutorials

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.160
around context managers,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.320
and sometimes they like try to tell you

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.600
how to build one up from scratch.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.440
Now, I've never built one up from scratch.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.440
I always use some of the wrappers and stuff

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.720
to do context managers.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.360
Anyway, containers and collections,

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.440
if you're gonna do a container

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.000
that you want length to work with or to iterate through,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.920
you need some dunder methods for that.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.000
Callability is one I've used frequently.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.480
You can create an object that's callable

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.400
if your class has a call method,

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.000
which is kind of fun to make callable objects.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.640
A bunch of arithmetic operators

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.520
so you can overload things.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.560
In place, built-in function, built-in math functions,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.680
attribute access, all sorts of dunder methods for you.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.720
So anyway, if you're thinking of overloading a class

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.200
so that it can deal with different built-in operators,

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.880
check out Trey's article.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.760
- Yeah, that's pretty nuts.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.640
Actually, I kind of am coming away from this

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.480
with the same feeling.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.320
It's like, I think I knew these.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.440
I was like, actually, no, there's more stuff.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.680
There's more there to go.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.840
- Yeah, there's a lot.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.280
I like the orderability though.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.720
It's 'cause I often, at the very least,

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.920
I wanna be able to sort things.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.360
- Yeah, yeah, indeed.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.400
Sorting is good.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.560
The one that I think is news to me,

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.440
maybe the casting ones,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.560
but also the string formatting one.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.680
Like you could have a user object

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.000
that you could say like colon E for their email.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.800
I mean, not necessarily would do that exactly,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.240
but just weird, right?

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.400
- Yeah, I'll have to play with that.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.800
- Yeah, all right, let's talk about this next one,

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.880
a lockbox.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.240
I don't think this is Python exactly.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.120
Oh, wait, I take it back.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.640
It is Python, 100%.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.080
But also, even if it weren't,

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.120
it's the kind of thing that you would use

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.120
as a Python person,

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.400
not necessarily make it part of your app.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.640
So this takes a bit of,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.560
it takes a moment to get your head around.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.560
So lockbox is a forward proxy

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.800
for making third-party API calls.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.240
And you're like, okay, keep talking.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.520
Maybe it'll all make sense eventually.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.360
So here's the deal.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.720
If you're gonna integrate with some third-party thing,

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.680
think Zapier, if this, then that, et cetera, et cetera.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.200
And those things are making API calls on your behalf.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.840
You have to give them the API calls

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.280
for the destination thing they're integrating with.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.520
So the example they give is if you wanna do a Zapier thing

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.400
over to Slack or Jira or whatever,

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.440
you give Zapier your Slack API key or your Jira API key,

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.280
which may be fine.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.360
I mean, Zapier is certainly a trustworthy company.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.280
I've had the CEO on the Talk Python a few times.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.120
He's great.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.920
But just on principle, you might not wanna do that.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.960
You know what I mean?

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.840
- Yeah.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.120
- So that's what this thing is for.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.000
So instead of giving that third-party,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.720
like Zapier, if this, then that, your tokens,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.160
what you can do is you can set up this lockbox thing,

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.640
and it's like an intermediary for this whole process.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.160
So you can register an app in your lockbox,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.800
and it gets its own just-for-this-one-purpose API key.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.000
You give that to Zapier.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.200
So Zapier calls lockbox, lockbox calls Slack,

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.800
or lockbox calls Jira or whatever.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.280
And it has a couple of advantages.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.840
So you can do things like you can audit

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.080
what actual traffic is being done.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.240
So you can see exactly what, let's just keep with Zapier,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.240
what Zapier is doing on your behalf,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.840
exactly what data is passed.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.720
And if something's going wrong, you could see that.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.560
It's still playing.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.600
- If Zapier's charging you for too many zaps,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.640
you can say, "I didn't use this many."

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.480
- Exactly.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.800
Here's how many zaps exactly you used.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.240
Yeah, some of these are plans.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.160
So you should be able to restrict access to external APIs

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.080
in a more fine-grained manner.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.240
You know.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.200
- Ooh, rate limiting.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.760
- Yeah, rate limiting on third-party API calls.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.400
But the primary purpose of it is that the API keys

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.360
are not exposed to anyone else.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.160
They just live in this lockbox thing that you control.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.000
And then you can, of course, throw them away.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.040
Drawbacks are, well, you gotta run your lockbox.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.080
(laughing)

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.340
Basically.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.180
And so on.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.960
But yeah, it's pip install lockbox-proxy,

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.400
and you set the sucker up, and off it goes.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.400
I think it's pretty cool.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.900
- Yeah, yeah, interesting.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.640
Especially, even if I didn't use this all the time,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.840
to be able to add it later if I needed to,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.440
to intercept that,

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.280
and especially for some monitoring purposes.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.320
- Yeah, it's an interesting idea.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.760
- Yeah, Andrew out in the audience says,

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.720
"Not that it gets sappier,"

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.280
but that kind of feels like an indication

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.200
that maybe it isn't the type of thing

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.920
you should be handing off to third parties.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.560
I may agree with you, although I think in practice,

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.640
a lot of people pass their keys all over the place

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.040
to get stuff done, you know?

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.760
Especially the less developer-y.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.360
The less developer-y you are,

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.560
the more you're like,

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.760
just click these things together and do it for me.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.600
Yeah.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.440
- What could go wrong?

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.040
(laughing)

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.400
- YOLO, come on.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.560
- Password's the letter A, I don't see any problem here.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.000
This is way more secure than that.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.040
- Good thing we made all passwords password.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.000
- Exactly.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.840
That way I never forget it.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.960
It just says, "What's your password?"

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.040
And I'm like, "Well, you gave me the hint right there."

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:34.880
Perfect.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.000
(laughing)

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.240
As our items, our main items, what else you got there?

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.320
- I got a couple extra.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.880
Since I covered Django a little bit earlier,

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.000
I wanted to, I ran across Adam Johnson's

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.600
Django Join the Community on Mastodon.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.560
I'm also working with Django a lot lately.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.040
So having, trying to follow some of the Django people

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.080
on Mastodon is good.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.480
So he's got a good resource for people that wanna,

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.320
if you're a Django person

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.440
and you wanna get started on Mastodon,

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.400
there's some good people to follow,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.240
some projects, official accounts around Django,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.200
and reminders to do a welcome post,

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.360
which I still have forgotten to do.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.840
So sorry, people out there that don't know who I am.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.320
Anyway, yeah, the introductory post is a good idea.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.880
- And to hit and throw it.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.400
So yeah, that, the other one extra sent,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.600
got sent in just this morning from Ken Van Wyk.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.600
And it's a website called unmaintained.tech.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.560
And essentially the idea is there's a badge

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.000
and there's some description.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.920
So basically if you wanna,

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.240
if you have some open source stuff

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.360
that you're just kinda done with

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.360
and nobody wants to take it over,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.520
you can just link to this to tell people

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.200
that you're not intending to maintain it.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.280
People can still use it as a reference and read it,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.840
but no promises as to whether it's gonna work

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.080
'cause I'm done.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.080
So interesting.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.600
- Yeah, some things are done.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.640
They're just done.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.480
- Yeah, some things, and it's okay.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.680
So you don't have to take them down.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.000
Just tell people that you're not working with it anymore.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.040
- Interesting.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.840
Wasn't there a thing with GitHub

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.720
where they were going to either take down

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.760
or charge very, very briefly for things

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.040
that had no activity over a two year period

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.000
or something like that?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And they quickly rolled it back

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.280
'cause people were like, "Stuff can be done.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.120
"Don't do that."

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.800
- Okay, yeah, I think that was pre-Microsoft takeover.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.920
- Yeah, that might have,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.120
you know what I think it probably was

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.720
when they were like, "How are we gonna pay for this stuff?

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.000
"We need to start getting rid of some of the storage

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.560
"of things that were just abandoned."

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.480
- And now they don't wanna do that

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.120
'cause there's all that AI meat in there to eat.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.160
So anyway.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.240
- That's right.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.720
Well, well, speaking of takeovers,

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.320
US sues Apple for illegal monopoly over smartphones,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.240
says The Verge.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.520
Now, I think the monopoly angle

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.480
is a little bit of interesting here.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.880
I had some conversations on Mastodon.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.520
People are like, "Oh, they only have 20% of the market."

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.520
In the US, they have over 60%, 68%, 60%,

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.560
something like that.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.960
But I think the real problem is there's nowhere else to go.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.800
Where do you go?

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.720
You go to one, there's literally one other option

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.640
in the entire world.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.920
I mean, I know technically there's like some Kickstarter

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.440
that somebody could have like 100 other phones,

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.480
but in practice, as an adult,

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.560
you need a smartphone to live these days,

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.800
to function in society.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.240
Like, well, you get this app to do this thing.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.760
Like, well, how do I get it on my phone?

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.960
I have to hit the get C.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.160
I press number one three times.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.280
I go, "Hey, you can't do this part of the world.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.120
"You're done."

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.320
And I think Apple, I think it's, I don't know.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.000
It's a little bit, a little bit of a silly lawsuit

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.160
in some senses that people don't really,

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.880
the people writing the lawsuit seem to be

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.640
not very connected technically

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.240
or deeply understand the problems here.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.360
I think there's some really legitimate causes

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.560
and I'm here for this.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.080
I hope this makes a change

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.560
because Apple is just such a bully.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.360
I have had such insanely bad experiences

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.280
working with them, getting apps in the app store,

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.480
which is crazy because you're like,

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.520
I spent, me and Lauren spent months

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.400
writing the latest Talk Python app

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.000
to just try to make the iPhone a little bit better,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.520
to make people who wanna do our stuff

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.920
enjoy doing it more on the iPhone.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.000
And they're like, "Nope, we're rejecting that.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.120
"And we have these rules.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.480
"We need more money from you,

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.080
"even though you're already paying us $100 a month

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.000
"and making the platform better."

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.160
For example, I'm sure people think I'm cranky about this,

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.200
but I just wanna give a little background

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.440
for people who haven't heard me rant about this.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.920
We submitted it and they said,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.880
"Well, it doesn't have in-app purchases."

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.720
I said, "That's okay.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.480
"I don't really want to sell anything through here.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.400
"My main, it's not like people are coming to the app

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.000
"and then they're becoming."

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.120
This is for people who are already customers of mine,

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:40.960
already taking courses.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.720
I just want them to be able to do that better.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.200
No, apps rejected.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.040
- Interesting.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.400
- But you have this clause, 4.3.1, called Reader Apps

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.560
that says if you bought material on the web,

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.360
like a book, audio, or video,

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.200
you're allowed to consume that on the phone

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.320
and there's no in-app purchase required.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.240
We don't care.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.200
You don't count as that.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.160
You're something else.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.160
- You're not as big as Amazon, so you can't.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.680
- Yeah, you don't get any special treatment.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.320
So what you're gonna do is you're gonna spend two weeks

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.320
for two people, full-time developing the in-app purchase

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.480
so that you can sell a couple of courses a month,

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.800
even though it costs you thousands and thousands of dollars

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.720
to do it, or you can't be part of this.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.080
The majority of your customers in the United States

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.920
can't have your app, right?

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.520
And just that we're going to grind it out

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.800
on these little companies to get a couple hundred bucks

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.640
and cost them tons of effort.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.480
Now it's harder to maintain the app.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.080
If I add a new course, I've gotta do more work

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.520
and release new versions of the app just because of that.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.040
It gets incredibly frustrating

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.480
how they're just doing this--

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.760
- Does this even talk about that?

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.520
Because when I read this, I was thinking,

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.880
I was thinking, I mean, I've felt this.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.880
I love Apple.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.760
I've got two or three computers.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.440
I got the phone watch, but I've thought,

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.120
hey, I wanna try a different watch.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.160
Oh, it doesn't work with anything else.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.320
I can't really.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.480
So I feel the customer lock-in part,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.000
I'm not really happy about that.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.120
But the other part that I, is that part,

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.040
and I don't know if the lawsuit covers that,

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.520
is this whole 30% tax that they wanna--

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.280
- I think, yeah, I think it does cover

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.480
the lack of ability of using other--

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.480
- Payment processors and stuff.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.640
- Other payment processing, other delivery methods,

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.520
all that kind of stuff.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.240
Like another really creepy thing that Apple's doing

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.440
is they're gonna allow only the big companies

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.240
to install apps over the web directly

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.680
and use their own payment processor directly,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.640
but only in Europe and only for companies

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.520
that have had over a million downloads previously.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.600
So there's no way to get started ever.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.440
- Yeah, you have to be--

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.520
- If you created a popular app now,

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.800
you have to have done it last year,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.920
but if you don't have it yet, how do you?

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.120
But then they're charging 27% for their fee

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.160
for delivering your app,

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.000
but if they're not doing the processing

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.800
and it doesn't go over their servers,

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.800
what is the 27% for again?

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.440
It's just-- - Just to give them money.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.800
- It's bad.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.760
So anyway, there's a couple of videos

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.720
from this guy called Theo Rance.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.200
They're actually quite good,

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.320
both the lawsuit and another one.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.360
And then also the day after, this was yesterday, Brian,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.120
the EU rejects Apple's European App Store changes.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.280
This is the one I just talked about

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.040
with some of those weird fees and other stuff, right?

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.080
Company could be fined 10% of global revenue,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.480
and 20% if they don't fix it after that.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.520
And so it's just one thing after another

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.200
coming down on this company that's just,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.400
they make 85% of their money off in-app purchases from games.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.160
They should just make the rest of it free

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.760
and not even make it a hassle for people.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.600
You know what I mean?

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.200
It's just like, why are they doing all of these things

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.240
to just for that last little bit of stockholder value?

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.720
- Yeah, but even the games part,

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.280
why are they taking 30% cut?

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.240
It's just, it's too high.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.440
- Yeah, and honestly, I don't even mind the 30%.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.760
What I mind is that they say

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.880
that these kinds of apps can't exist

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.760
or your app has to be completely rewritten

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.760
so that you do start selling even if you don't want to,

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.920
or we won't accept it, right?

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.160
If I wanted to sell it, I'd be like,

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.120
all right, look, 30%, it's rough,

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.720
but it's digital products, I'll live.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.320
But the fact they're like, you can't even not,

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.240
you can't even choose to not sell stuff.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.800
We're gonna make you sell stuff.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.360
And that kind of stuff is just,

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.400
that's where I think like, okay, this is over the line.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.680
When it's that high of a percentage

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.920
and you treat people like that,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.520
it's bad news for you.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.200
That said, I have like five Apple devices just in this room.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.120
So I'm very conflicted.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.880
- Yeah, definitely.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.800
- Yeah, yeah.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.400
Okay, I have a few more things, they're quicker, I promise.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.360
The PSF is looking to hire somebody,

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.960
which is awesome, for PyPI support specialists.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.840
How cool is that?

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.320
- That is cool, yeah, right about that.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.080
- It's kind of nuts that all of PyPI,

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.200
with, you think of the infrastructure,

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.160
the amount of bandwidth flowing through that thing

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.000
and how much traffic there is in that website

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.800
that there's nobody whose job is to keep it running.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.640
It's kind of nuts, but yeah.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.320
So a PyPI support specialist is a job,

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.920
a person that are looking to join the team.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.840
So if you're interested in that, check it out,

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.400
that'd be really cool.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.600
Let's see, why is this looking like it looks here?

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.680
There we go.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.960
We're gonna do, this needs to go away.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.800
We're gonna do a VS Code, ask me anything with Brian Clark,

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.360
not Brian, I can, Brian Clark and Cecil Phillip

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.640
and me and 21 days.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.240
So if you wanna be part of that YouTube only event,

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.920
then the link is in the show notes, check that out.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.640
You can submit questions ahead of time.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.960
So if you've got one, please, please do that.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.080
In the lastly, a quick conference thing,

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.760
here Thomas said, hey, just let you all know,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:45.600
PyData Eindhoven 2024 will take place on the 11th of July

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.320
and there's a call for proposals open.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.360
So if you're interested in that, check it out.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.280
- Okay, I've got one extra, extra thing.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.840
- An extra, you have an extra, extra.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.680
- Extra, extra.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.680
And partly it's an apology.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.560
So I've been doing the emails for the show,

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.960
but I kind of forgot last week.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.440
So I'll get the, this week you'll get two

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.120
or we'll combine them into one or something like that.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.240
But how do you get the email?

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:12.080
So if you go to Python Bytes and click on friends,

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.600
you can fill out your name there

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.760
and get the show notes into your inbox if you want.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.200
So, plus we'll sell it and make lots of money.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.720
No, we don't sell your email or anything.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.160
We don't sell it.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.120
We don't even transfer it to other locations.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:28.960
It's pretty excellent.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.200
We've got some good infrastructure set up.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.640
- I don't even look at them.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.040
So.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:34.880
- Yeah, exactly.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.640
Only if something goes wrong, do I bother looking.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.280
All right, well, let's wrap this up with a joke.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.120
- Okay.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.320
- So, Windows, some of these different operating systems

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.840
and ecosystems have more certifications than others.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.280
Like there's the network certifications

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.440
for network engineers and Windows has got a lot, right?

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.960
So there's the Windows certified technician.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.680
(laughs)

00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.000
It's a game, it's like a giant arcade

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.840
that has the windows on it.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.760
It says, "Can you make it work?"

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.160
Can you make it work?

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.280
"Battle your way through driver updates

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.560
and registry edits on your quest

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.160
to defeat the dreaded blue screen of death."

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.880
And there's like a super excited guy with a toolbox

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.200
ready to take on the Windows blue screen of death

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.960
and hack the registry.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.120
Can you be a Windows certified engineer?

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.960
It's the hottest game of Dave and Busters this year.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.920
- Okay, but look at the controls.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.400
You gotta be a Windows engineer

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.080
with a track pad and three buttons.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.160
- Yeah, but look at the labels on the buttons.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.840
There's four buttons, you missed an important one.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.320
There's a big giant roller ball, like track pad.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.160
What is that?

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.000
Track ball.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.840
- Track ball.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.440
- Then there's three buttons, Control + Alt + Delete.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.280
But down at the bottom, there's another one

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.240
that says reboot.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.480
It's like the bonus button.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.480
- Yeah, that's good.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.880
- I'll make this the chapter art.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.720
This is good.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.040
- Yeah, awesome.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.720
- All right, well, always fun.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.800
Thanks for being here, Brian.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.640
- Thank you.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.840
- Yeah, thanks to everyone for listening.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.680
Catch y'all later.
