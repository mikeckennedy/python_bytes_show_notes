Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.600
This is episode 105, recorded November 21st on Turkey Eve.


00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.100
Yeah.


00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.200
And I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.000
And I'm Brian Atkin.


00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.500
Hey Brian, are you ready for Turkey Eve?


00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.700
No, not at all.


00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.400
Yeah.


00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.200
Are you?


00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.600
I'm getting there, I'm getting there. I just picked up a whole bunch of stuff.


00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.800
We're going to cook a turkey and it's going to be crazy.


00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.400
So, yeah.


00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.000
We bought a smoked turkey, so it's already, all the work's done.


00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.120
- Yeah, that's the way to do it.


00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.240
Just save yourself the trouble.


00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240
I don't know how many people out there listening


00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.520
who don't go through this Thanksgiving thing,


00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.640
actually cook turkeys, but it's kind of stressful


00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.480
and it takes forever.


00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.960
It's like many hours.


00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.360
- Yeah, and then for some reason,


00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.960
everybody wants to eat dinner at two o'clock


00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.800
in the afternoon or something weird like that.


00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.040
- They've probably been drinking since 10,


00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.240
so you know, that's why.


00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.080
All right, so for those of you who celebrate Thanksgiving,


00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.920
happy Thanksgiving.


00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.960
For those of you who don't,


00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.960
a happy email Black Friday spam week.


00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.040
and hopefully got some deals.


00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.480
- Yes.


00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.600
- So thinking of crazy things,


00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.400
it's pretty awesome that DigitalOcean


00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.000
is giving people $100 credit for creating an account


00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.600
over at pythonbytes.fm/digitalocean.


00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.080
Tell you more about that later.


00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.640
You know, one thing I like about Thanksgiving


00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.160
is it lets you sort of look back on history


00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.680
and think about your family


00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.960
and kind of just older stuff, right?


00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.160
- Yeah, it does.


00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.000
It's nice.


00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And maybe look at some old pictures.


00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.280
- Yeah, but sometimes it would be great


00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.120
if they weren't like, you know, old and black and white


00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.880
and boring and crummy.


00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.720
- Definitely.


00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.240
There's a project and it's Python based


00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.680
and machine learning called DeOldify.


00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.720
- DeOldify, the name says it all.


00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.640
- Yeah, it would be actually a great name


00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.600
for a health club too, I think.


00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.440
What it is is, I can only sort of describe it.


00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.360
What it does is it takes a black and white photo


00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.880
and makes it look awesome.


00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.740
And like, does a whole bunch of cleanup of sharpening


00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.160
and then colorizing it.


00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.920
You kind of have to look at these pictures.


00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.200
They're kind of amazing.


00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.600
One of the things I like about actual old pictures


00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.420
when they started to take color photos and do colorizing,


00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.280
there was a lot of color.


00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.280
It wasn't muted, whereas a lot of the,


00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.440
some of the colorizing algorithms that are out


00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.440
are kind of just come default to obvious things


00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.880
like grass is green and make everything


00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.320
kind of brownish and stuff.


00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.200
And it just makes it a little bit better


00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.560
than black and white, but not really.


00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.840
but these really pop, like adding purple and greens


00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.480
and reds and all sorts of awesome things.


00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.280
- These are glorious, like the old SodaShop one.


00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.840
It's just so amazing.


00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.600
Do you know how it gets the color right?


00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.360
Like why does it not make people purple or something?


00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.760
- Well, I mean, things like people are sort of an easy thing


00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.220
because they're gonna be kind of people colored.


00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.480
(laughing)


00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.320
- Okay.


00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.900
- If we get too far into how it works,


00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.040
I really can't tell you.


00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.340
- Well, it does use deep learning,


00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.900
which means like if you get too deep down,


00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.820
nobody knows how it works in some sense, right?


00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.220
Like you've taught it sort of by example?


00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.380
- Yeah, yeah, it's definitely based on self-attenuation,


00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.600
generative adversarial networks,


00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.900
and progressively growing the GANs


00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.340
with a two-time scale update rule


00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.540
and generator loss in two parts.


00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.760
I have no idea what those words mean,


00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.780
but that's part of it.


00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.780
- I think it's a really cool project.


00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.160
I mean, you know what would be like a great Christmas gift


00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.440
something would be to like get a hold of some old photos, do this against them, and then


00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.120
take them and like turn that into a photo book for like your grandparents or something.


00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
Wouldn't that be awesome?


00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
Yeah, it would be.


00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.520
And I'm actually, I can't wait to try playing with this.


00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.600
What I'm going to, with our main link in the show notes of this is an interview with, it's


00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.600
a text-based interview with Jason Antic, the developer of DeOldify, talking about why he


00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.880
developed it and how he developed it.


00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.640
It's kind of a really fun article.


00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.720
So if you're curious about this, either just play with it,


00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.840
try it, or read the article.


00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.980
- I really like these visual things.


00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.160
I think it very clearly highlights how amazing


00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.320
just this whole deep learning,


00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.800
machine learning thing is, you know?


00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.160
- Yeah, and this is a sort of a fun application of it


00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.720
that I would have never thought


00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.160
we could make our lives better


00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.520
by making these photos better.


00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.400
I mean, I wouldn't have thought


00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.720
machine learning would be for that, but it's cool.


00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.800
- Yeah, it's very cool.


00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.860
So remember last time how you said


00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.560
Brett Canham was going to be mad at me?


00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.060
Yeah.


00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.860
Well, Brett Canham will probably be happy,


00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.400
because I got a lot of items on VS Code this week,


00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.040
and they're pretty awesome.


00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.240
So I didn't do it to make up for it,


00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.400
but I'm happy to feature them.


00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.240
So this first one has to do with IoT.


00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.360
And I think IoT is one of these amazing things that often


00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.440
is below the surface.


00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.960
Like when smartphones came out, it was so amazing.


00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.000
Everybody saw it and you're like,


00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.800
show me that thing, that's incredible.


00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.800
But the fact that, I don't know,


00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.440
your refrigerator's slightly smarter,


00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.880
or your microwave, or your doorbell,


00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.640
I think it's less obvious.


00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.600
But there's tons of IoT stuff out there,


00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.160
and the ability to do it in Python these days


00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.000
is great, right?


00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.040
- Yeah, and it's amazing how the IoT everywhere


00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.760
is sort of just make, it's no big deal anymore, so fast.


00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.080
- Yeah, and the price is coming down,


00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.320
the energy consumption is coming down, it's great.


00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.560
So the thing that I wanna tell folks about


00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.360
is something that Jason Percor told us about,


00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.000
called PlatformIO IDE for VS Code.


00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.280
So PlatformIO is this platform for interacting


00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.580
with all sorts of IoT and small device type


00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.480
of programming examples.


00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.160
And it has tons of languages.


00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.360
And what they've done is they've built in a debugging,


00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.600
their framework, all that stuff, into Visual Studio Code.


00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.440
- Oh, that's cool.


00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.840
- And what's cool is 'cause it's Visual Studio Code,


00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.080
it has all sorts of mixed mode understanding.


00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.980
So if you're doing C++, embedded C++, great.


00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.840
If you're doing Python, great.


00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.460
It knows about all these things.


00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.480
So super cool.


00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.520
It has a cross-platform, of course,


00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.880
because it's just VS Code, basically.


00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.240
Built-in debugger.


00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.880
Check this out.


00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.200
Remote unit testing on your device.


00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.160
That's pretty sweet.


00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.280
Firmware updates, all that sort of stuff.


00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.520
- Yeah, neat.


00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.240
- Yeah, so if you're working on, like,


00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.240
Arduinos or something like that, it's


00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.920
sort of comparable to the Arduino IDE, which I haven't actually


00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.280
used very much.


00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.140
But it's sort of that kind of thing.


00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.280
Now, there's a few features.


00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.240
I think firmware updates and a few other things are paid.


00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.080
But it's like $9 a month.


00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.360
But there's also a free version.


00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.200
So it's a little bit like PyCharm in that sense.


00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.440
There's a paid edition and a free community edition.


00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.360
So it's pretty cool.


00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.760
The Platform.IO core itself is written in Python,


00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.960
which is awesome.


00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.360
But it's written in legacy Python.


00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.240
Boo!


00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.920
Hiss, hiss.


00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.840
But that's OK.


00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.960
And then finally, Jason put together


00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.560
a video of when he--


00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.140
it's sort of an unboxing of the IDE, but it's digital,


00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.960
so you don't really take it out of anything.


00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.640
But when he first sort of test drove it--


00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.520
Oh, that's neat.


00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.960
--going through it.


00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.240
So it's like a 15-minute video.


00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.560
So if you really are interested in doing this and seeing


00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.400
how it works, you can check out Jason's video,


00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.200
which I also link there.


00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.760
Nice.


00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.260
Cool.


00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.760
Yeah.


00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.640
So IoT, definitely a cool option here.


00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.000
You might be collecting a lot of data on those IoT devices,


00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.280
right?


00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.960
You could have them all grabbing data


00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.840
from all over the world every five seconds,


00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.960
streaming it back, dropping it somewhere.


00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.200
You want to look at it, right?


00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.760
Yeah.


00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.040
You might want to make that into some visualization.


00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.920
>> Yes.


00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.520
>> There's a lot of options.


00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.680
I actually, I'm in the middle of this problem right now with


00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.760
a work project of trying to decide


00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.080
which visualization libraries to use on a particular problem.


00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.480
>> Let's draw a graph. Wait,


00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.120
there's 300 ways to do that. Why is this?


00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.360
>> Yeah. There's an article,


00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.640
it's on the Anaconda blog called Python Data Visualization 2018.


00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.080
Why are there, why so many libraries?


00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.040
It talks about, you know, how like there's some of them are map,


00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.440
there's matplotlib of course, and there's a whole bunch of others


00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.360
that are based on matplotlib.


00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.880
And then whether or not you use JavaScript and then, you know,


00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.480
if you use JSON or something else, and then there's WebGL.


00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:07.040
And anyway, this, it's a nice breakdown of the different tools and kind of the data,


00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.520
like what the behind it, like what data and stuff


00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.480
are they're using?


00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.000
And then also what you can do with them,


00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.800
what plot types you can do.


00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.880
And generally if you're, like if you're using,


00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.600
for instance, geographical data,


00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.240
then you probably maybe should look at a map plot lib


00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.580
with Kartopi or a few others.


00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.500
They've got some examples and they bucket them together.


00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.200
So it's less of a search.


00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.600
You don't have to look at everything


00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.960
to see if you should look at it.


00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.960
and also kind of what your data size is.


00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.480
And I very much appreciated this


00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.080
to kind of narrow things down.


00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.900
- Yeah, it's really cool.


00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.160
And there's a great visualization as well


00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
from Jake Venderplass,


00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.840
which it's kind of like a mind map of related,


00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.320
linked together different visualization libraries.


00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.680
So it has like, well, here's D3 as one of the major hubs,


00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.280
and you've got Matplotlib.


00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.720
And maybe for Matplotlib,


00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.520
you might wanna use scikit-plot,


00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.460
which is derived based on that.


00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.420
Or if you're using D3, you might use, I don't know,


00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.740
D3 Poe or whatever, like one of these other things.


00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.420
But it also says, well, you can combine


00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.860
Matplotlib and D3.js and get MPLD,


00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.700
Matplot-something-3, like a combination.


00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.100
MPLD3, I guess, I don't know.


00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.340
But the relationships, so maybe,


00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.340
oh, if I'm using this, there's this other library


00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.180
that also has some other features I could combine.


00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.020
I think it's cool.


00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.700
- Yeah, they all kind of interrelate.


00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.180
And then I wanted to point out that there's some,


00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.580
Sometimes you just like I just want something simple


00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.980
I really was looking for this example about a year ago, and I wish I would have found it, but there's a


00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:48.640
Example I'm gonna link to that's just a really short article and then a link to a gist which is just a single file containing


00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.080
Flask application that both generates and displays a couple matplotlib


00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:02.080
Charts so now the plot lib might be the simplest thing, but it isn't obvious right off the bat


00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.200
how do you encode, how do you generate one of these things


00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.920
and then link to it in a web page and all that sort of stuff.


00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.520
So this is nice.


00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.360
- Nice, nice.


00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.640
I don't have a reason to draw graphs too much,


00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.240
but I'm starting to think maybe some BI type stuff


00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.600
might be in my future.


00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.720
That would be interesting to learn


00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.380
and I'll definitely have to come back to this


00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.760
to figure out how to look at it.


00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.600
Cool.


00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.440
So before we get on to the next one,


00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.560
which will also make Brett Cannon happy, I think,


00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.520
is I want to tell you quickly about DigitalOcean.


00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.520
So DigitalOcean, great hosting provider,


00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.800
super affordable, really rock solid.


00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.080
And one of the things that's cool that they do


00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.800
is they've created this idea of projects.


00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.840
Because often you go into your cloud provider


00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.600
and you've got these testing servers


00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.320
and all this stuff.


00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.720
You're like, well, what goes with what?


00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.200
Is this thing, can I turn this server off?


00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.440
Is it being used, right?


00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.620
What group is it related with?


00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.100
So they have this idea of projects


00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.040
and you can group your droplets,


00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.560
which are VMs and load balancers and domains


00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.100
and IPs and all that into these different projects


00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.400
so you can treat them individually


00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.640
as like all of this infrastructure goes with this site


00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.160
and that infrastructure goes with that site


00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.000
and stuff like that.


00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.040
So very cool.


00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.120
You should check out what they got going on over there


00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.640
at pythonbytes.fm/digitalocean.


00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.640
And like I said, you'll get $100 free credit


00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.000
if you create a new account there.


00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.400
So very nice stuff.


00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.200
Now, speaking in the cloud


00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.080
and speaking of Visual Studio Code,


00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.360
I wanna tell you all about coder.com.


00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.020
So coder.com is a thing


00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.340
I recently learned about.


00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.940
They reached out to me for some stuff on Talk Python.


00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.900
And after playing with it, it is pretty cool.


00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.660
So you know how VS Code is an ElectronJS app, right?


00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.260
OK.


00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.940
So in ElectronJS, there's kind of a hidden Chrome--


00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.620
the thing that you see is a window that's really Chrome,


00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.080
just like a headless Chrome type of thing running


00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.580
some kind of HTML there.


00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.020
And then it talks to Node.js over a local transport


00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:55.780
of some sort.


00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.220
What if you could separate those?


00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.200
What if the Node.js backend lived in a server


00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.560
that was really awesome,


00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.780
and then you could just put the front end


00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.700
anywhere like a website?


00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.740
- That's kind of how it's designed to work.


00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.940
- Yeah, yeah.


00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.860
It seems possible, right?


00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.900
So basically, that's like Coder.com.


00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.580
So it's full Visual Studio Code,


00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.380
but in your browser on awesome hardware.


00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.620
So you can write code in your browser,


00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.980
and because it's full Visual Studio Code,


00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.880
you get all the 4,000 extensions,


00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.460
all the different languages,


00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.700
and it's not some cheapo imitation,


00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.500
sort of sometimes the autocomplete works,


00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.820
IDE in the cloud, it's like literally just Visual Studio,


00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.980
but working in your browser.


00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.100
So it's really, once you fire it up and you get going,


00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.220
it's like, within a few minutes, you're like,


00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.140
oh wait, that's not the regular top bar for my app.


00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.980
That's a browser window, but you would just kind of forget.


00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.380
And it has some other features, so like,


00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.500
it runs, every time you create a project,


00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.420
your project lives in a Docker container,


00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.080
and you get root access to install and configure


00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.620
that Linux Docker machine however you want.


00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.600
So you can do basically whatever you want


00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600
in the cloud on this thing.


00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.500
And there's a paid feature, you can push a button,


00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.880
and it will give you up to 96 cores of computational power.


00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.660
You get a certain amount of free, like five hours,


00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.520
but after that, it's a paid feature.


00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.560
But still, it's pretty awesome.


00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.240
So if you wanna work on Linux and you're on, say,


00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.700
Windows and you need hardcore Linux, not just a VM,


00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.100
but something that's really running solid, you can use this.


00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.740
If you're on a Chromebook or you're on a tablet,


00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.040
this would be awesome.


00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.880
All sorts of stuff.


00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.180
Another thing that's really cool is it has


00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.420
Google Docs-like collaboration.


00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.540
So multiple people can be working on the same file


00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.380
at the same time.


00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.200
- Oh, that's neat.


00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.040
- Yeah, it's pretty awesome.


00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.020
So anyway, I wanted to tell people about it.


00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.980
They just launched a few weeks ago


00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.780
and I think it's pretty awesome.


00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.300
They have really good Python support.


00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.220
You can obviously pip install all the stuff you need


00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.260
'cause you just open the terminal and you have root access.


00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.580
So do what you like to it.


00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.940
- It looks like it has a whole bunch of plugins


00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.860
available too.


00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.020
It isn't just bare VS Code.


00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.100
- Yeah, no, it's super cool, that thing.


00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.720
So, quite a neat project.


00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.640
Now, just for transparency,


00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.220
they did sponsor Talk Python to me,


00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.060
but this is not an ad,


00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.060
this is just like, I learned about it because of that,


00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.220
and I'm like, oh, this is pretty cool,


00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.320
I'll tell people about it here.


00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.300
So, anyway, something worth checking out,


00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.060
and the free option is pretty cool.


00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.120
You get like three gigs of disk space,


00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.020
one gig of RAM for free forever, pretty much.


00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:16.860
So, it's pretty cool.


00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.340
- Yeah, that's generous.


00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.620
- Yeah, yeah, not bad.


00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.460
All right, what's your next one?


00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.460
This one, it just popped up on my news feed,


00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.960
I think it was this morning.


00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.420
This is a Forbes article about Guido


00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:34.260
and trying to bring more women into the Python community.


00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.460
Some of the stuff I didn't,


00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.180
I knew some of these things were happening,


00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.420
but I didn't know some of the impetus and the,


00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.680
I mean, I was glad, but I didn't really understand why.


00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.540
But apparently in 2015, somebody just mentioned to him,


00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.540
like weird, there's no women in the core, in Python core, why?


00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.540
And, you know, he talks about a lot of projects having that problem,


00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.540
or at least a situation where there's not a lot of women contributing,


00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.540
and you kind of have to examine why that's going on.


00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:11.540
And so he took on putting out an offer saying that he would mentor women


00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.540
that wanted to become core developers.


00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:20.540
And of course we know Marietta was the first, and that's awesome.


00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:26.540
And now there's four altogether, and he just wants that to keep growing.


00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:32.540
And it's also kind of a nice talk. It's an interview that happened after he stepped down,


00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.540
saying that he's definitely going to stay involved with Python,


00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:42.540
it's just he doesn't want to be part of all the everyday fighting and stuff.


00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.360
>> I read this also and I was thinking about,


00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.220
there was a comment that Python was worse than


00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.020
the average just commercial engineering team.


00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.380
That is troublesome, but I think a lot of,


00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.020
even depending on what field you're in,


00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.060
this might still be a problem and I think people need to


00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.980
examine their own hiring processes


00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.300
and how you get people involved in your project,


00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.740
and whether it's open source or whether it's commercial,


00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.200
And take a look about really, one of the comments was,


00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:20.440
some teams will say there's no women in the core because nobody's been interested, nobody's asked.


00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:27.140
But that's probably a little insincere if you take a look about how the commit bit happens.


00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:32.740
It's often a kind of a nebulous, fuzzy, we trust this person sort of a thing.


00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.740
And a lot of hiring is that way too.


00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.900
And the argument that a lot of hiring people say is,


00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.880
well, I would hire a woman or somebody,


00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.060
other underrepresented group, but nobody applied.


00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.820
And I think that's just kind of BS.


00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.780
You have to go out of your way


00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.140
to try to find a larger pool.


00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.940
And so this is just a good reminder.


00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.900
- Yeah, it's a great reminder.


00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.020
And Guido did super important work there.


00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.140
I said it before, but I think,


00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.060
I've been to different types of programming conferences,


00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.380
And coming to a Python conference


00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.780
is a much better experience in feeling


00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.540
like this group of people represents


00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.320
the general population of the world compared to other ones


00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.580
where not so much, or not at all, basically.


00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.780
So I think that's a really positive aspect of what's


00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.060
happening for the community.


00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.860
And it's great that Forbes--


00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.180
I mean, Forbes, that's a huge place to cover this.


00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.620
So that's pretty awesome.


00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.580
And on your hiring thought, a lot of jobs I think get filled by first asking all the


00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.500
team members who work there, "Who do you know and who's awesome?


00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.500
Who should we hire?"


00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:44.140
And when that process fails, then it's like, "Fine, we'll put like a general, put a general


00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.900
job offer out there that everybody might get."


00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.180
But I can certainly see how that would create reinforcing groups because the team that you


00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.540
have would know people most likely like them, right?


00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:02.180
right? Yeah, and also the some of it's the the crucible process of the hiring process of as well,


00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:07.140
even if you have people that are decent candidates. I don't remember where I could


00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:14.340
have this reference from, but I've heard a comment that more frequently a male will apply for a job


00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:22.100
where he meets at least two of the qualifications, but more likely a woman will only apply for jobs


00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.260
where she meets all of the qualifications and there's a difference right there.


00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:32.720
So you have to it has to start from the very beginning of be very careful what you put in your required qualifications


00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.580
Because it'll eliminate a bunch of people. Yeah, I think that's really interesting


00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.660
I speak to my wife about this sometimes and she's like guys will just


00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:45.880
Say they'll just they can do this thing or or whatever and they can't they don't have all this the experience or everything that they


00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.160
Need and they'll just do it and then they'll get the job and women don't and I don't know


00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.320
She wasn't really saying that was unfair. She's just saying it is the way it is


00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.000
So you have to be aware of it. It is the way it is


00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.400
But I mean on one hand let's put this out here as an encouragement to women to say look if you have a moment


00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.560
Requirements, yes


00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:07.920
And if you have most of it's a wish list and if you have most of the things or the important ones even just apply


00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:14.560
Right. I mean there's so many opportunities for JET learning just in time learning like if you know three out of the six things


00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.960
but you could take some online classes or something or read a book on the others like


00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:26.800
Just apply. Yeah, the other end of it is often part of the hiring process isn't really on qualifications. It's on


00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.240
Fit do they seem like they already fit into the team?


00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:30.720
Yeah


00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.960
And you have to be really careful with that because you you might end up with a whole bunch of people that are kind


00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.460
Of the same. Yeah, I think that one's that one's trickier and these needs attention


00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:45.220
Okay, so the last one that I want to cover is from a very inspirational woman named Annalena


00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.860
Popkis, and I had her back on Talk Python just last week, actually.


00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.860
That was an incredible interview, too.


00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.860
Thank you.


00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:58.460
She was such a great guest, and so many people wrote to me and said, "Wow, she was really


00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.460
inspirational."


00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.460
And I think she was.


00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.540
And one of the things that was inspirational was not long ago, she had no programming skills,


00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.680
Then she decided to go into a computer science


00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.240
master's program in machine learning,


00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.100
and now she's working at Microsoft's AI residency program


00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.980
in just a few short years, which is incredible.


00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.800
And the thing that I wanna tell people about


00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.220
is directly from that whole path.


00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.520
So she put together a GitHub repository


00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.460
of IPython notebooks, Jupyter notebooks,


00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.500
that are basically explorations to understand


00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.580
the core algorithms of machine learning.


00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.420
- Nice.


00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.620
Not, I want to create, you know, import scikit-learn


00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.820
and feed this function a few things,


00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.220
but with no dependencies, how do we build up these algorithms


00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.420
and what does that look like?


00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:42.920
Cool.


00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.020
So if you're out there and you are doing data science


00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.120
or want to get into data science,


00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.120
she has a bunch of really nice notebooks that you can check out.


00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.320
I'll link to most of them here.


00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.320
And this is built in modern Python, so hooray for that.


00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.320
So anyway, she built this for herself to learn these algorithms


00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.920
actually did this sort of career progression,


00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.720
and maybe throwing it out there is going to help a lot of people.


00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.020
It already has like 2,500 GitHub stars, so I guess it will be.


00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.520
Plus it has a perceptron.


00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.320
I don't even know what a perceptron is, but that's a really cool word.


00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.620
I know. It's like a psychic power used by the machine learning algorithm.


00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.020
[laughter]


00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.120
No, I have no idea what it is either, but it sounds awesome.


00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.520
I'm sure there's data science people rolling their eyes at us for not knowing this stuff.


00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.220
I'm sure.


00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.720
Yeah, I was going to make a good joke about another algorithm to follow up on that,


00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.560
but I just failed.


00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.140
So we're just going to leave it there.


00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.220
But yeah, so check out Anna Elena's work


00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.480
if you're getting into data science.


00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.480
That's pretty cool.


00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.900
Well, that's it for our main items, Brian.


00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.920
What else you got for us?


00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.860
Any little extra things you want to throw out?


00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.660
Just somebody mentioned to me the other day


00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:48.100
that AWS Lambda now supports Python 3.7, which is awesome.


00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.580
Yay, you can use data classes.


00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.420
Yeah.


00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:51.900
That's cool.


00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.060
And it wasn't like it upgraded from 3.6, I think.


00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.500
I think it was something before that.


00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.900
They were like, well, when is 3.6 coming?


00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.220
And they just said, skip that.


00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:58.720
3.7.


00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.920
Oh, they don't have 3.6?


00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.520
Well, they might now.


00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.240
I think that they were saying they were waiting for 3.6 and then actually 3.7 came out.


00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.960
I could be wrong about that, but I feel like this was a big jump in the 3 world.


00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.280
Yeah.


00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.520
I was so happy with 3.6, but now the 3.7 is here.


00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.880
I'm like, yeah, I'll just use 3.7.


00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.280
Yeah.


00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:12.800
That's awesome.


00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.280
How about you?


00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.320
Got anything else?


00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.760
Remember you asked me what Shabokan meant from last time?


00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.080
Yeah.


00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.520
It has a super deep meaning.


00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.560
Actually, no, it doesn't mean anything.


00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.960
It's just a random name.


00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.680
I wonder if it was, what was that?


00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.400
Hack your name?


00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.760
Like they could probably just name it from hack your name.


00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.360
Right.


00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.440
- Yeah. - Yeah, so right now


00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.280
I get Stylis for hack your name.


00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.880
That's pretty much as good as Shabokan,


00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.200
but Shabokan, I actually link to the blog post


00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.400
that says there's no name,


00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.240
but it's still a pretty cool C++ interop thing.


00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.360
Also, people out there listening,


00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.200
if you want to nominate somebody


00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.160
to become a PSF fellow, Python Software Foundation fellow,


00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.520
this is a group of folks who every quarter,


00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.960
five people are nominated and put on the roster


00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.440
as having done something awesome


00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.880
for the Python community in general.


00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:04.280
So I'm linking to the place where you can read what this is about and then nominate somebody.


00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.680
So if someone out there is doing something cool, nominate them.


00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.580
That way they have a chance of being in this group.


00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.380
Are you a fellow?


00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.180
I am, actually. Very surprising.


00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.280
I didn't even know about Python Software Foundation Fellows, and somebody nominated me,


00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.880
and they said, "Hey, you got the award."


00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.980
I said, "Wait, what?"


00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.980
So yeah, whoever nominated me, thank you so much.


00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.680
That was awesome. I am. Yes.


00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.480
Yeah, that's cool.


00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.680
So it would be waste if somebody were to nominate you again.


00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.440
- Yeah, the link I actually sent is a Twitter thing


00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.600
that says, "Please don't nominate me.


00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.400
Here's how to nominate somebody."


00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.240
- Oh, okay. (laughs)


00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.060
- Thanks.


00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.040
Yeah, yeah. - Cool.


00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.860
- But that's pretty awesome.


00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.900
All right, so anyway, I'm sure that would really


00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.200
make somebody's week if they got that,


00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.160
and they probably don't even expect it.


00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.000
- Yeah, nice.


00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.400
- Cool, all right, well, that's it for this week, Brian.
