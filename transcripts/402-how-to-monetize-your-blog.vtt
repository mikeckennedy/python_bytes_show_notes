00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.600
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.600
headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.160
This is episode 402 recorded September 23rd, 2024.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.160
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.360
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.160
This episode is brought to you by Scout APM.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.680
We'll tell you more about them later.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.680
If you want to keep up with us or the show, follow us on Mastodon.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.640
Links are in the show notes or over on X.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.840
If you really, really want to, you can find the links there

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.800
in the footer of the website.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.520
We typically live stream on Mondays.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.720
Now we used to do Tuesdays.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.040
Remember we moved to Mondays.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.400
So Mondays 10 a.m.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.000
Pacific time on YouTube.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.920
If you want to check that out, we'd love to have you.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.400
Always great to have people in the audience, but certainly not the environment.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.400
And finally, if you want to get artisanal handcrafted summary put together by your

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.560
very own Brian Okken about the show right after it ships, sign up for the newsletter.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.040
Just go to PythonBites.fm/ right there and just click newsletter right at the front.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.320
It's probably the easiest way actually.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.720
But in your email, we won't, we won't do bad things with it.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.320
We'll just send you updates.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.800
So, and things about like horses and other stuff.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.000
Horses, courses.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.440
Okay.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.880
Horses, courses for horses.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.120
No, this is a totally different kind of show.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.360
We go down that path.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.120
Let's what path do you want to take?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.880
Um, let, actually let's make some decisions.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.000
Uh, how about that?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.720
Yes.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.360
Okay.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.120
I actually, this was suggested to me actually at a work setting.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.960
Um, a friend of mine, Christian Gazelle said, Hey, architectural decision

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.960
records are pretty cool.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.720
Uh, do you use them?

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.360
And I had not heard of these things.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.720
So I was excited to explore the rabbit hole.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.360
So, this was, there's a article that we're going to link to.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.720
This is the original from 2011 called documenting architecture

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.320
decisions from Michael Nygaard.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.720
And, and it's, it, it's kind of this idea that you just have this lightweight

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.200
document to, to discuss things like, what you're deciding about, what the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.960
context is, what, you know, what, what the current situation is, and then the

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.800
decision, what you're going to do.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.640
And so the context is why, why you're doing it.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.040
The decision is what you're going to do.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.640
And then, you know, status, like if you're, whether you're

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.280
proposing it or whatever, I'm playing with status right now.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.760
So, and then the consequences, what you hope to will be

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.280
the benefits of this decision.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.200
This seems like, like, like so silly and simple that it can't be helpful, but it

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.640
is, it is awesome.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.480
Um, and I've started using it just for a few days, so we'll see.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.720
But, so there's another article I'd like to link to, and it's from, from

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.720
Red Hat called why you should be using ADRs or architectural decision records

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.840
to document your project.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.960
And it's a, that's, that's a really nice, lightweight introduction.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.160
Um, and, shows you basically you just had a handful of things and there's a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.640
bunch of templates people are using.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.920
I'm using Markdown.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.800
Um, and I'm going to show you the, essentially the template I'm using.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.520
It's just a Markdown file and I've got like a template, just a 0 0 0 ADR template

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.840
dot MD that just copy paste, modify.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.960
And it's just a few lines.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.760
And I've likely, sometimes I just put none in.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.160
If I'm not considering any options, I'll just put none, but I might fill it in

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.960
later, but including pros and cons for options.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.280
Um, this isn't, this is really only taking me a few minutes to get the stuff that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.800
I'm thinking about or the project and the things I want to change out of my head.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.040
And somewhere.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.440
Um, and since it's in Markdown and I'm storing it with the, with the code in the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.600
repository, it works great because, because the, because it's a GitHub or

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.560
GitLab just renders it it's Markdown.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.600
So it just gets rendered and it looks beautiful.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.880
Um, but it's super fast to just write this down.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.920
Um, and I'm, I'm already like, in, so the step, okay.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.400
I want to talk about the status a little bit.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.160
The proposed status, the status that was recommended in the original is like

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.200
proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, and it's kind of formally.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.640
So I've been using things like trying it out.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.440
Um, haven't decided yet because I'm like documenting the process as I'm going.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.560
And I'm guessing like, by the time I say accepted, I'm going to stop

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.560
editing these documents, but.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.040
I've got a couple architecture things that I'm just trying out playing with,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.640
you know, do be an agile about it.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.640
And, and it's helping me to actually go even just back a day to say,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.800
what was I thinking yesterday?

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.280
And, and having that written down someplace.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.960
And then I'm also working with a remote team, so it's good to have the remote

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.240
team to be able to like, they can see what I'm thinking by reading these docs

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.640
and other people can do too.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.160
So anyway, highly recommend architecture decision records.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.920
Yeah, that's great.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.320
You know, one thing that's might be cool to pair this with is the old style

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.160
GitHub projects, not the crummy new ones, but the good new, good old ones.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.640
Okay.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.120
Where you have counter on boards and they go through different stages, right?

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.080
So the status could be the columns of your projects and you could have just a

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.560
project for decisions and you could just see where they've gone and you know,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.120
maybe, somehow reference.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.720
Yeah.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.960
And a great issue is something to link it all together through GitHub, but that'd be cool.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.560
Definitely.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.040
And I've seen, there's a bunch of people that have done a bunch of extra stuff on

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.400
top of this to make it more processy.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.040
But to me, now it feels official and I don't want it to feel official.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.280
I want it to just be like dumping stuff out of my head.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.760
There's also a different, a different thing of like, how much things do you put in there?

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.040
Is it everything?

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.680
Is it, just big, important architectural changes and that you just sort of have, I'm

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.600
just playing with it to see what it is.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.760
I'm not putting bug fixes in here, but I'm putting things like, I'm really changing

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.720
a component, taking it here and putting it over here.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.680
Why am I doing that?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.120
Right.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.920
We're switching from FastAPI to flask and here's why.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.720
Something like that, right?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.480
So yeah.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.040
Theoretically.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.560
Awesome.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.320
Well, let's go to the sea and visit some narwhals.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.360
So I just had this, this project, had Marco Corelli on talk Python.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.280
This is a project he's doing a lot of work with and narwhals, it solves a problem.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.320
You can see their logo.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.400
If you go to their website, it's a pandas and a polar bear in a narwhal

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.960
kind of hanging out behind them.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.040
And the idea is if you have, if you are writing a library that takes a data frame

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.000
source, right?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.520
So if you have users for doing pandas and they want to, you want to write, write a

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.360
library and say, Hey, send me your pandas data frame and I'll graph it or I'll analyze

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.440
it or I'll do AI around it or whatever it is you're doing with it.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.000
You will probably get a message issue or something that says, Hey, we'd like you to

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.960
use polars.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.160
How do I work with that?

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.720
I want to convert everything to pandas.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.360
I want to use polar's like, now how do I take these two?

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.360
And then you're like, well, we actually use moden or we use, QPI for, GPU

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.960
programming.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.400
Can we pass our data frames?

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.120
You're like, great.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.760
Cause nobody wants to convert out of their native framework into this thing and into

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.360
some other one.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.840
Cause it's probably going to make it slow.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.920
Like if you convert out of a GPU into pandas, well, what's the point, you know?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.960
So that's what the goal of this narwhals thing is.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.600
It lets you primarily, it's primarily for people who are creating graphing libraries,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.080
analysis libraries, others that can take all these different frameworks.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.680
Okay.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.160
Right.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.760
And then what you do as the library writer is use a subset of the polar's API, a real

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.360
simple one program that comes from narwhals, but it's the same API.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.680
Right.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.360
And so you basically do that and then narwhals itself knows how to figure out

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.920
which data frame library you're working with, how to work with it.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.040
If it's polar's and it does, it's lazy operations, it won't turn it into eager

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.040
operations that will continue to be lazy until it gets evaluated, which is really

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.360
good for performance and memory.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.320
But if it's an eager API from pandas, also that very low overhead.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.040
If you go check it out, full static typing, lots of promises of stability.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.640
Because the point is to be a foundational library for other libraries, not cutting

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.680
edge, new features.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.000
So anyway, if people are out there and they want to work with multiple frameworks for

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.520
whatever reason, especially if you're creating libraries that you want to let

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.200
people from different slices of the data science world use, then this is pretty

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.440
awesome.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.040
So do you know, is it, it's not converting things as it brings it in, it's leaving it

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.560
in the native data.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.680
Yes, exactly.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.600
Yeah, exactly.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.320
That's part of the bonus here is that it does that.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.800
And then basically you write to the subset of the polar's API, but then narwhals

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.120
it's okay.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.000
Well, is it really a pandas thing or whatever?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.200
Yeah.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.160
What's the underlying thing?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.960
Yeah.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.360
Yeah.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:30.440
Yeah.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.080
I don't have a direct use for it because I don't data science as much, but I think

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.000
it's cool and wanted to share it.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.360
It will be on talk Python in much greater detail than I just explained in a couple of

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:42.680
weeks.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.720
You can find it on the Python live stream YouTube section already, but the full

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.920
edited version will be out later.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.480
All right.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.240
That's pretty cool.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.480
Yes, indeed.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.800
And sure is.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.400
How about we talk about our sponsor real quick, Brian, before we move on.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.320
That sounds great.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.040
Let me tell you real quick about Scout APM.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.240
They're big supporters of Python bites.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.800
So we appreciate that very much.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.760
So if you are tired of spending hours trying to find the root cause of issues

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.720
impacting your performance, then you owe it to yourself to check out Scout APM.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.160
They're a leading Python application performance monitoring tool, APM.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.920
That helps you identify and solve performance abnormalities faster and easier.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.760
Scout APM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks, slow database queries, background

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.520
jobs, and the dreaded N plus one queries that you can end up if you do lazy loading

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.040
in your ORM, then you say, Oh no, why is it so slow?

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.360
Why are you doing 200 database queries for what should be one?

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.680
So you can find out things like that.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.560
And it links it back directly to the source code.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.080
So you can spend less time in the debugger and healing logs and just finding the

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.960
problems and moving on.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.200
And you'll love it because it's built for developers by developers.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.680
It makes it easy to get set up.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.440
Seriously.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.280
You can do it in less than four minutes.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.080
So that's awesome.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.440
And the best part is the pricing is straightforward.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.600
You only pay for the data that used with no hidden overage fees or per seat pricing.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.880
And I just learned this, Brian.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.040
They also have, they provide the pro version for free to all open source projects.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.920
So if you're an open source maintainer and you want to have Scout APM for that

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.240
project, just shoot them a message or something on their pricing page about that.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.240
So you can start your free trial and get instant insights today.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.960
Visit by them by set of him slash scout.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.040
The link is in your podcast player show notes as well.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.400
And please use that link.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.280
Don't just search for them because otherwise they don't think you came from us.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.840
And then they'd stop supporting the show.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.400
So please use our link by them by set of him slash scout, check them out.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.320
It really supports the show.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.480
Well, next is, it's a little bit of bizarre news from the Northwest.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.840
Um, the you're probably, so I'm, I'm a little bit older than you, I think.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.680
Um, so I don't directly remember it, but I kind of remember the, the,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.560
the meltdown at three mile Island.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.880
And then I'm 27.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.320
How old are you?

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.000
I'm just, so I was born in 1970, so I was nine years old.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.920
So it wasn't really something I was completely aware of, but we, you know,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.320
we heard about it later cause it was kind of a big deal.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:14.360
So what this was, was a, nuclear nuclear facility in near, near Seattle.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:14.680
Ish.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.240
I don't know.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.560
I'm not that good at geography.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.920
Um, three mile Island in Washington.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.680
And there were two reactors and one of them did a partial meltdown

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.960
and it was a big, big thing, but it was, it's the worst nuclear accident

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.520
we've had in the United States.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.840
Um, and okay.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.240
So why am I talking about this?

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.800
Well, I didn't, I guess, I guess I didn't realize it was still operating up until

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.800
2019, not those reactors.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.200
There were other reactors nearby safer.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.200
I mean, in nuclear energy has come a long way and there's, and actually this three

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.160
mile thing was the reason why we have a lot of the nuclear, regulations we

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.800
have now, it did sort of put nuclear energy on the back burner more than it

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.720
probably should have been.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.800
And I'm not going to get into the politics of whether or not we should

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.360
have nuclear energy too much with that.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.280
I didn't want to get into that too much, but what I am want to talk about is that

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.360
it's going to start up again or it's proposed to, so it was closed in 2019.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.200
It might open again in 2028 and it's only going to be for Microsoft.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.560
This is the bizarre bit.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.760
So Microsoft, Microsoft wants to start this up again and have an exclusive 20

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.360
year deal for what 835 megawatts of energy.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.600
Um, just going to AI.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.680
Uh, this seems bizarre to me.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.040
So the, so AI needs a lot of power and, and yeah, so that they're just

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.400
going to, they hope this isn't the still in proposal phase, regulators,

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.960
regulators have to approve it.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.880
But, we're going to start up another nuclear power plant just

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.080
for, just for Microsoft AI.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.840
This, I just don't get it.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.640
Uh, so there's, there's that.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.280
Um, and then it was, this was, we linked to the verge article.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.000
I, I found it on the verge, but then I searched for it again.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.080
Some more, and there's just a CNN article as well.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.600
And also what it looks like.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.600
There's only one picture of this thing that's being used everywhere.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.440
Uh, anyway.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.120
Oh, I guess that's a different picture, but, so kind of start up again.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.040
Uh, it seems odd.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:19.640
Uh, and then, in a related news, I guess that's all I just wanted to say

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.080
is, I think this is weird that we're going to start a nuclear power plant just for AI.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.760
Maybe that's a problem.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.880
Uh, anyway, the article I found was, just, it's kind of a mock news article,

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.920
but this is just a mixed weenies, internet tendency.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.600
The article is the department of energy wants you to know that your conservation

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.160
efforts are making a difference.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.640
So I thought we were trying to like save the planet by saving energy and stuff.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.600
And, this has got some interesting bits.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.800
Um, it says, by turning off your lights all day, every day, you can serve

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.000
about 1% of the energy needed for AI to generate a picture of a duck wearing

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.480
sunglasses is an EQ, aside from the fact that he has feet that are a human of a

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.480
human man, of course.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.360
Um, so AI is consuming tons of energy and we're in the rest of our lives.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.000
We're trying to conserve energy.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.200
That's just a, I don't know.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.520
I, maybe I shouldn't brought it up as a topic.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.520
It's just seems bizarre to me.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.680
So I'll leave it there.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.480
Well, so I love these.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:28.880
Let's put your, your feeling bad about wasting energy or your effort to save

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.480
some energy and perspective.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.280
And it's just like, yeah, I mean, I still go around and turn off the lights after

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.920
my kid who just like leaves them on.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.680
Well, yeah.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:43.000
And also we're, I've like stopped buying 25 cent light bulbs and now we buy $8 LED

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.800
light bulbs that last about the same as the other bulbs used to.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.200
And they are more, I mean, we're spending way more on light bulbs and for what?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.840
So that AI can have more energy, I guess.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.920
Yeah.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.560
So on one side, I totally see the point there on the other.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.600
If we're going to dump tons of energy into AI, I would much rather see it coming from

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.800
carbon neutral sources than coal plants, you know, true fair, right?

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.280
Like, are you going to make the duck or are you going to not make the duck?

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.000
Like regardless of what light bulbs using people are making ducks and let's do that.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.520
Better.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.440
I think it's super bizarre that three mile Island is the choice because if there's

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:26.560
anything in at least American culture that says nuclear energy bad, it's three miles.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.040
Like anywhere else, you know?

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.440
Yeah.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.960
Well, they're going to change the name.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.720
It's going to be called the crane clean energy center.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:41.720
Oh, there's a good rebranding that, that said I'm super optimistic on

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.160
nuclear energy as a climate solution.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.160
Not necessarily old school three mile Island stuff, but the molten salt

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.960
reactors, the things that fail safe and not fail explosive like Fukushima.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.440
Right.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.920
I know there's nuclear waste.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.720
There are less, those new ones are less bad.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.120
And you know, I feel like a lot of the pushback against it.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:04.320
It's a little bit like, well, there's this rare endangered lizard in the desert.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.560
So we can't have in this desert, any solar farms.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.080
It's like, well, if it gets 20 degrees hotter, there's going to

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.360
be no lizards in the desert.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.520
We need to take some more positive action.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.000
And I feel like, you know, nuclear energy is that sort of in the extreme, right?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.720
People have such strong reactions, but there's so much better tech now.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.880
And I would love to see that.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.200
Yeah.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.600
My personal views are that I think it would be good to utilize what we have,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:34.040
including nuclear energy as a stop gap to get us off carbon based fuel.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.360
And then once we get that, we can get carbon neutral.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:43.480
Then we can go to, then we can be, as we beef up solar and, and wind

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.680
and everything, then we can maybe draw away from nuclear.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.600
That's a great way to put it.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.280
Like let's get rid of the carbon pollution and then we can debate

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.240
of the things that are working, which ones are working best.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:54.840
Very well.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.920
I also wanted to point out the excellent pun that you made intentional or not,

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.640
that with nuclear energy, people have strong reactions.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.800
That's very good.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.160
All right.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.280
People might have a strong reaction to this as well, but I got to

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.680
say it's way less, way less out there.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.400
So here's the strong reaction.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.120
I think when people use Docker, so this is a Docker topic.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.320
When people use Docker, there's two philosophies.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:24.320
One philosophy is I want the lightest weight, simplest, most basic thing that

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.560
I can possibly use to build my containers.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.360
So they're insanely small, right?

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.280
I want almost nothing there.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.480
I just want, if it is not needed for whatever I'm trying to do to execute,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.920
it doesn't belong there.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.800
Let's get it out of there.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.240
Yeah.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.400
That's one side.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.960
Does this topic is not from that topic is from the other side of perspective

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.080
that I would say the Michael side lives on that I live on in that is Docker can be

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.760
more difficult to understand what's going wrong when something goes wrong.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.880
How do you fix it?

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.840
How do you get other tools to see what's happening inside there?

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.240
Right.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.640
And so I think there's a bunch of people that stay away from Docker because

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.040
they're like, Oh, I just want to have access to the logs and the, the tools

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.200
that I normally use and all that kind of stuff inside my server or my VM.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.440
So I can understand what's happening better.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:10.880
Right.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.200
So one of the tools I really like is, Oh, my Z shell, right.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.880
With all of his plugins is auto-complete is cool history.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.080
And so I present to you ZSH in Docker.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.040
It installs Z shell.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.480
Oh, my Z shell and the plugins like auto-complete for source control and for,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.400
um, you know, all the, all the various plugins that you get right from Z shell.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.520
And it's one line.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:40.120
So you put this run shell at the, the, the, out of this repo and it just installs

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.880
Z shell and installs, Oh, my Z shell.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.360
It makes it the default shell.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.200
Or you just run it when you get into it, whatever.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.680
And then all the plugins, et cetera.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.480
So really, really nice.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.080
You even get to pick your theme as part of the one liner so that you can see

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.160
like what version of Python is active.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.640
What is the state of a get repo?

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.600
If you copied a get repo in as part of setting up your Docker container

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.560
and all those kinds of things.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.320
So super simple.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.280
If you believe in the, I want some tools inside of my container.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.840
So when things are not working, I can exec into it and ask what's going on.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.200
And this is really awesome.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.160
Uh, if you don't want that, if you're in the opposite side, this is not for you.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.200
All right, cool.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.120
Indeed.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.120
So do you, how much time do you spend in Docker?

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:26.080
Uh, very little, but when things are not quite working or I'm trying to figure out

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.800
a command, you know, maybe you've got a database running in there and you're

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.960
like, I really need to see, I just want to see what's going on with this.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.680
And you know that inside the container, there's some database management tools.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.360
If you just Docker exec Z shell, and then you start typing, it's like you're, you're

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.320
just on SSH in effectively.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.240
So, yeah, I'm going to have to check that out.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.680
So I'm changing my doc.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.840
Like I used to use Docker a lot for like actually cross compiling, C++ code.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.800
And I'm using it more now for web stuff.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.680
Um, and so, yeah, absolutely.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.400
I think it's great.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.720
And obviously I do a ton of stuff with Docker and for running the web apps and

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.800
things, but I don't go into the web apps unless I have questions.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.160
You know, but when you do, it's nice to just go, oh, okay, well, here's the thing.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.000
And you just make this one of your base layers of your Docker image

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.080
and it builds nice and fast.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.720
Nice.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.240
Okay.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.960
Um, well, we're, ran through our topics.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.880
Um, I don't have any extras today, so you're extra less.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.960
I'm extra list.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.480
What is the opposite of extra?

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.080
I don't know.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.800
I got a few basic, maybe I guess bear the bare minimums.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.200
Okay.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:40.440
So first one is I remember I spoke about this thing, this uptime Kuma while ago.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.520
Uptime Kuma is great.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.320
So it's self-hosted, free uptime monitoring.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:46.720
Okay.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.640
Well, I put in a bunch of things, like for example, if you go to Python bytes and you

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.800
go to the bottom and hit server status, it'll show you the server status of Python

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.360
bytes, how old the SSL search from let's encrypt are and all those kinds of things.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:20:59.560
Right.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.160
Very cool.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.080
Well, I turned that on all of my web things.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.560
Including my personal blog, which this might resonate with you, Brian is my

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.640
personal blog built with Hugo, which is a static site, so it cannot crash.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.640
It is HTML, CSS image.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.800
Like you can't crash.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.280
Right.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.800
And I thought, Oh, I'm going to host this on Netlify because

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.960
Netlify is pretty awesome.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.400
Right.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:20.960
Right.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.160
Yeah.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:26.560
Well, I started getting every single day or every other day, your site has a five

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.760
Oh two error and it's been down for 10 minutes.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.400
Now it's back.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.160
It's been down.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:31.720
What?

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.840
How could it possibly?

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.080
It's a static site.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.200
So something about the Netlify infrastructure was going bonkers.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.920
And I will tell you if you already have an Intunix server laying around somewhere,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:49.200
it's about eight or nine lines of code of Intunix configuration to just host it yourself.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.960
So I switched this over to running on server that runs all the other things that I got,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.280
but because Netlify was crashing.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:01.520
So I think the takeaway is not that mkennedy.code is my personal blog, website,

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.160
consider is hosted anywhere different.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:03.960
Like, why do you care?

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.760
But if you're hosted on Netlify, maybe point some uptime status at your thing,

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.560
even though it's a static site, shouldn't fail.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.640
Look at it anyway.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.840
Mine was for a week or two.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.920
I would say at least two weeks, it has been all sorts of broken temporarily.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.280
So is it better now?

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.080
Yeah, it's perfect.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.680
Cause why would it have any problems now?

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.320
It's on our server.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.160
Yeah, it's better now.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:25.640
Okay.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.040
Okay.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:26.840
So that's number one.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.600
That's just a, check that out.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:35.840
Number two, over at Talk Python, if you go to the courses and you go to the apps, we've

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.720
really nice new version that came out, I think last year of our mobile apps for all

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.960
the courses, including Brian's pytest course.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.640
You can take it that way.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.280
The one that comes from Talk Python that is.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:52.360
Well, the guy who wrote this, Lauren Auge, I had him on Talk Python when we talked

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.000
about Python and mobile apps along with some other folks.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.400
Anyway, he used to be a live sound engineer until COVID hit.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.080
And then he moved over into software development and he wrote up a really

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.960
detailed story of his life journey.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.960
And I just wanted to share that if people are interested in that, maybe you're making

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.040
that transition as well, then, you know, check that out.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:12.440
It's pretty cool.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.000
That's pretty cool.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.400
Yeah.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.840
This other short one comes to us from it.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.160
Itmar Turner.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.000
I Turner trowing says it's time to stop using Python three, eight.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.600
I can't believe that, but it is.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.480
He puts it, he puts it onto our radar that, you know, 14% of the packages

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.720
downloaded from PyPI are for Python three, eight installations.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.440
And by the way, next month it's going end of life out of supported, no

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.880
virus, no security fixes, nothing.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.280
So you might not want that to be your foundation if you get to choose.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.360
And we got like seven days left to September.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:45.640
Yeah.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.280
I would say it's yeah, five weeks.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.280
What could go wrong?

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.200
Anyway, just put it on your radar.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.600
Maybe Python three 12.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.800
It's been out for a long time.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.600
Version six of that one just came out.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.200
So I think we're good.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.040
You know, three, 12, six.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:02.400
Oh, I also want to add to that, that since like, it's been years since I've ever

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.200
had any, any significant issue upgrading.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.640
Um, at most I'll see deprecations that I have to go through and, and

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.160
clean up or warnings or something.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.880
But I, maybe other people have, but I haven't had any issues,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.640
for really long time upgrading.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.440
So, yeah, same.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.600
I did have an issue with, I can't remember.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.520
There was some, it was packages that didn't support three 12.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.920
There was some deprecation in there that I had to wait three or four weeks before

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.960
I could start using three 12 when it first came out for some of my apps.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.520
However, that's not the same as to say that Python itself is unreliable.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.520
You would know right away if the imports fail or whatever, right?

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.000
Like you'll, you'll find out straight away.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.880
And so, yeah.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.880
And I don't remember the reason why, but on a couple of the projects that I've

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.560
converted from three eight to three 12, work projects, I jumped to from three

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:58.440
eight to three 10 with no issues or minor issues and then to three 12 fairly easy.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.040
And for some reason it just helped me to go from three 10 and then three 12.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.400
Uh, but anyway, your mileage may vary.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.600
It's these, it's these kinds of things that if you don't do it, you eventually

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.520
end up saying we have a two six app and a half million lines of code and

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.040
it's still running on Python two six.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.160
So don't talk to me about your fancy new libraries and your typing and your async.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.560
We're just trying to survive, you know, like, but if you keep, if you get into

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.600
the practice of just like, okay, well, let's just keep this stuff moving.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.240
All those steps are generally small unless you try to take them 10 years at a time.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.640
They're stressing me out, man.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.520
PTSD from two six.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.520
All right.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.440
Last thing.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.720
So pass keys.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.800
Let me ask you really quick, Brian, are you a pass key user?

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.400
Yes.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.400
Well, pass key is in believer.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.240
Well, yeah, I use pass keys.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:46.560
Yeah.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.760
I do too.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.800
I've been resisting using pass keys.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.160
So pass keys are cryptographic kind of like, almost like SSH keys, but for the

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.560
normal normal folks for just web authentication, right?

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.360
So cryptographic thing, blob that gets put into your, whatever thing is signing

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.440
in and if it shares that back, it's supposed to be dedicated to that instance.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.240
It knows it's you.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.760
Often you can skip to a phase, all those kinds of things.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.000
Right.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:16.080
But one of the things that really turned me off on pass keys is they felt to me,

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:21.480
like a couple of the tech giants are like, Hey, this is a sweet opportunity for lock-in.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:26.160
So let's see how much lock-in we can get, you know, Android and Apple, especially

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.040
right, like, Hey, just save your pass key to your iPhone.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:29.840
What could go wrong?

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.360
I was like, well, I could lose my, yeah.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.280
If I could lose my iPhone or even if it's synced to iCloud, like what?

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.000
I have a smart TV that says, you know, log in with your password.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.400
It's a super pain to type in, but you can do it.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.880
Or maybe I'll go over to my windows PC and I have to type in some password to log in.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.320
A lot of times it'll say like, Oh, your Microsoft account is expired.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.880
It's login, login again at the boot screen.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.080
So I don't get access to anything.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.680
I was like, Oh my gosh, this is a pain.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.880
But those situations get way worse.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.920
If you have pass keys that are dedicated to, you know, one provider, right.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.280
That's, that's just a mega lock-in.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:11.960
So I realized that if you're a one password user or I think also bit warden, I'm a user of both of

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.120
them and I really like them.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.200
If you store your pass keys there, all of a sudden they live everywhere.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.760
It's beautiful.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:21.040
And if your computer gets destroyed, just log into one password or it wouldn't or whatever

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.560
again, and you have them all again.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.160
So if you at least for one password, if you go into the watchtower, there's a section that

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.520
says, show me all the sites that could have past keys that I don't have stored past keys for

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.720
here, and it'll help you go through and basically add the no one password, which is a form of

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.840
lock-in, but a much lower grade form of lock-in in my, my feeling.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.560
So anyway, I am now a believer of past keys.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.080
I believe I went through and did that this weekend.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.680
I added like 35 accounts or so that have past keys and now life's a little easier.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680
Like GitHub, for example.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.360
Yeah.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:54.840
Nice.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.440
Yeah.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.320
So, all right.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.360
You have the joke for us this week.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.000
Do you not?

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.800
I do.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.920
And I actually, I thought it was going to be a topic.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.880
I just had it in my, in my backlog of how to monetize a blog.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.360
And then I started reading it and realized this is just a hilarious joke.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.000
And I love it.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.480
So I wanted to bring it up here.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.720
And so, and you should either, if you're listening and not, not on YouTube, you should

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.200
watch the, watch the video version or just go check it out yourself.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.120
I'll link in the show notes.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.560
Okay.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.360
So how to monetize a blog.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.800
I talked to, and I actually thought it was going to be advice, but it's just funny.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.000
Maintaining a blog can be a lot of work.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.920
I started reading it.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.160
You don't really need to read it.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.960
There's some fun font that shows up right away.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.880
Like, like there's, it can become a fairly lucrative venture and the become is in this

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.920
wacky font.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.560
I love the M that's cool.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:54.200
And then so you're going down and you see these various things like, like TimberQuest

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.760
advertisement, your lumberyard awaits you, my Lord.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.760
Play now.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.880
And almost all the, the, the clickable things, if you click on them, they just like pop up

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.680
little coins.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.480
You don't actually go anywhere.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:12.600
And then talks about slapping this bad boy here can start raking in some cash through

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.360
true primary means CPM or CPA.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:21.080
And and then you just sort of, if it's sort of seems reasonable, but it says, look, look,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.080
how am I doing so far?

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.240
I've, I've made 0.123 cents so far on this.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.000
And then it just adds it up.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.040
There's different various various little links around that if you click on them, it

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.400
increases the how much money this person's made, even though it's not real.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:44.800
But if you, I just started reading the ads, like there's an ad for minimal effort

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:51.200
graphic design, no proofing and time to say the ads are hilarious.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:58.160
Here's one free cruise sign up today with eligible purchase meeting or exceeding value

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.560
of cruise, after which no purchase is necessary.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:05.800
Of course, click on that guy for some extra cents.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.920
Let's see.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.520
I'll read one.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.760
The more clicks and grizzly bear sales you can squeeze out of your beloved readers, the

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.840
more of their money you can siphon to spend on cheeseburger deliveries.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.360
And of course, cheeseburger deliveries is clickable.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.040
It's got to be an affiliate link, right?

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.680
Yeah.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.560
All these things.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.120
Uh, let's see.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.400
Uh, here's a little, a little weird thing.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.360
Uh, add on the side that looks like a Amazon or eBay thing.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:37.680
Friendship assembly, 1595 collapsible by valve, and a that which

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.440
molts beneath enclosures toy.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.720
This is bizarre.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.360
I love these.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.240
I'm going to scroll down more literal snake oil, vials of freshly

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.560
squeezing, squeezing oil from actual snakes.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.960
Um, befriend a sandwich.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.280
No doctors allowed.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.600
The first mystery grab bag of unmarked vitamins is free.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.600
Um, oh, and then it pops up.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.720
We get a pop up, push notifications.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.680
Would you like to enable push notifications so you can receive

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.240
intrusive alert messages like these outside of the browser?

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:09.760
Yes.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.720
Or ask me later.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.560
Uh, I'm sure I said yes.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.960
And see if you got a coin for that.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.720
Yeah, maybe let's do it again.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.280
Another one.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:18.840
Yes.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.440
Oh yeah.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.040
Oh, you did.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.120
You make, get some money for that.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:21.480
Yeah.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.160
And a weird pop-up cheese cube burger now open.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.320
Uh, let's see.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.680
We soon become, oh, it's too bad.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.440
You can't see this.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.280
This one is a ice cream holding tips.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.760
Um, there's, we have radishes that will change your life.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.560
Add, let's see.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.320
Uh, huh.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.840
Oh, these, these are my, these are just my mind rending.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.000
God radishes, old school.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.040
Um, excuse me, a virus was detected on a computer.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.760
Send bit points like a Solaris window.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.600
Um, oh, anyway.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.440
And then you, you just sort of scroll down.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.640
It just comes, it becomes even more bizarre.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.480
You've got sideways text.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:07.240
Uh, and then, the, the spiral, this is awesome.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:07.920
I don't even know.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.960
So I was like, how did they do some of this stuff?

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.520
It's pretty cool.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.720
It's some pretty cool stuff.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.760
Uh, monetize.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.360
That's how you do it.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:13.880
Yeah.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.280
If you go all the way down also in the, if you actually start reading it, it says

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.360
stuff like there's not actually, you just sort of have to spew out lots of words.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.400
I didn't even edit this.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.640
Um, and then way at the bottom, there's a credits, how this was made.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.880
And then, this person goes through and walks through, basically all

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.320
the different, procedures for how, like how to do the spiral, how to do the

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.400
cool font, and all these sort of tricks, with HTML and CSS and whatnot.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.520
So anyway, just a hilarious little, blog on stupid ads.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.600
Um, that's awesome.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.720
Andre out there says this is art.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.240
It's definitely art.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:51.640
Yeah.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.440
Not art, but real time follow up.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:33:00.520
Bitwarden also supports pass keys, which Bitwarden being open source and the

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.520
paid version is insanely affordable.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.680
It's like a dollar, a couple of dollars a year or something.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.560
I can't remember exactly what it is, but maybe that's the proper

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.080
recommendation there for, for pass keys.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.360
But anyway, pretty cool.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:13.680
Yeah.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.120
Cool.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:14.480
Yeah.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.200
Well, let's call it a show, huh?

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.680
Yeah.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.240
It sounds good.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:17.720
All right.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.600
Well, thanks for being here.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.680
Thank you everyone for listening.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.200
See y'all later.
