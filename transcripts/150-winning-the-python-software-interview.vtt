00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.520
This is episode 150 recorded September 25th, 2019. I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.400
And I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.320
And this episode is brought to you by Datadog. Check them out at pythonbytes.fm/datadog.


00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.320
More on what they have to offer later. But Michael, right now I kind of sense a theme.


00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.600
Are you looking for a new job? Are you hiring somebody? Or what's going on?


00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.800
I'm going to cover a couple of topics about getting better at interviews.


00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.920
You know, I kind of hope I never have to apply for a job or go to a job again in my life.


00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.180
So no, I'm not actually on the hunt for that.


00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.280
But I do have a couple of friends who are looking for jobs.


00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.080
And you know, I'm just a little sympathetic to the challenges and whatnot.


00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.920
So I want to kick us off with a thing called how to stand out in the Python coding interview.


00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.920
Okay.


00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.800
This comes from James Timmons on, and he wrote it on real python.com.


00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.520
So it's kind of a Python version of the stuff that it seems like the tech


00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.080
industry thinks you should know.


00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.440
And I feel like it's a little bit better.


00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.240
I feel like the tech industry says, Oh, you know, which is better,


00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.760
a bubble sort or a quick sort?


00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.320
You know what?


00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.920
I don't care.


00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.120
I call sort on the list and we're good.


00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.280
You know, I don't maybe sorted like you could debate dot sort versus sorted,


00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.520
but who cares, right?


00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.320
Like, this is not a problem we need to keep solving.


00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.840
And yet it feels like in the interview process


00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.200
it falls back to, well, they asked about big O notation,


00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.600
they asked about algorithms of that type,


00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.120
they asked about a data structure,


00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.760
like when would I use a doubly linked list


00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.520
versus a single linked list?


00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
And like, ah, I can go build a Python web app


00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.360
with SQLAlchemy and talk to Stripe and charge a credit card,


00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.200
but I forgot when I use a single linked list, right?


00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.680
single direction like list.


00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.440
But that seems like what people are testing.


00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.320
So here's an article that sort of covers


00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.440
those kinds of questions, but specifically


00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.360
for the Python developer.


00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.200
And I think it's pretty decent.


00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.800
So it's meant to help you kind of navigate


00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.640
that space of Python and show you


00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.440
that you have some knowledge of the built-ins


00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.360
and of the language and things like that.


00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.360
And you can kind of write decent code.


00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.200
So it covers a handful of things


00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.000
with a bunch of other stuff mixed in there.


00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.500
So how do you use enumerate to iterate both over a view of like collection to


00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.020
iterate both with indices and values.


00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.160
And if you've been doing Python for a long time, that's obvious.


00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.500
We do that a lot, but if you come from a language like C++ or Java or


00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.260
something that doesn't have this all of a sudden, well, then it's really weird.


00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.680
Right.


00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.540
And you don't know to use it.


00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.780
So it's good to have that in there.


00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.880
Debugging with breakpoint formatting with f-strings F yes.


00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.560
For that one.


00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.460
That's great.


00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.860
Sorting.


00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.220
All right.


00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.820
Sorting lists.


00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.660
I talked about that, like you don't have to care about the algorithms, but


00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.980
knowing how to sort stuff is really nice generators and it's pressure on memory.


00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.120
Default values and dictionaries using the counter class and then


00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.680
just some standard library stuff.


00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.260
And I think knowing all those things kind of puts a nice Python spin on


00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.860
that level of Python interviewing.


00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.320
Yeah.


00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.280
Do you do any interviewing?


00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.380
I haven't actually applied for a job for several years.


00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.220
Do you do it in reverse though?


00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.820
Do you hiring?


00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.540
I mean, like interview people for it there.


00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.780
Yeah.


00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.860
- Yeah, definitely a lot.


00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.500
And I help out with other teams too when they're hiring.


00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.960
And like, for some reason,


00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.780
people know me as this person that knows Python.


00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.340
So I'll do the Python interview part.


00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.380
But yeah, a lot of this stuff is stuff that I look for.


00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.700
If you actually say for I in length, the interview's over.


00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.500
Just, you don't know Python then.


00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.580
- Yeah, I mean, maybe if you're hiring for,


00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.300
like I'm hiring a developer and it doesn't,


00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.540
they don't have to know Python,


00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.700
but they're going to be doing it.


00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.940
So we're going to help them along.


00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.980
And they are, they're really good at Java.


00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.460
You could probably mentor them over.


00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.460
But if your goal is to hire an experienced Python developer


00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.300
and they don't know for item in collection,


00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.300
like, yeah, you're done.


00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.180
- Yeah, but I'm a pretty fair person.


00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.700
I talk through stuff.


00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.820
People can always recover.


00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.820
If you freeze up, don't worry about it, just flow with it.


00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.140
I think people should interview more,


00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.400
even if they're not looking for a job,


00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.380
just to keep up their interview chops.


00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.220
It's good.


00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.040
- Yeah, nice, I agree.


00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.580
- Speaking of being nice to people,


00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.780
we have a bit of news,


00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.700
and even though I didn't even actually know


00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.540
this was an issue.


00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.100
So there was an announcement made


00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.620
that the PSF, the Python Software Foundation,


00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.700
updated its code of conduct.


00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.420
And apparently the PSF had one code of conduct for the PSF


00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.220
and things it was sponsoring,


00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.980
and a different one for PyCon US.


00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.460
And now there's just one.


00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.140
So that's the big news.


00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.740
And we've got links to the code of conduct


00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.440
and the enforcement guidelines and reporting guidelines.


00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.540
And we hear about codes of conduct occasionally and stuff.


00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.620
And in the past, I've thought,


00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.820
why do I have to care about this?


00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.640
I mean, just don't be a jerk and try to be a nice person.


00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.820
Isn't that enough?


00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.200
And for the most part, yes,


00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.100
but if that was all there was to it


00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.460
and there weren't any problems,


00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.780
then we wouldn't need these.


00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.300
And clearly we need them.


00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.120
Things come up.


00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.300
So I think it's good for people to go,


00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.260
it's not a long read.


00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.660
I think people should read them,


00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.500
especially before you go to an event


00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.980
to make sure you know what's up with that.


00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.620
The other thing that's nice to look up


00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.420
is what is the reporting mechanism?


00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.860
So if you see somebody violating these,


00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.500
or basically just somebody being a jerk,


00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.580
what do you do about it?


00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.420
Who do you contact?


00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.180
And so that's good to just sort of,


00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.320
at least have read it once so that if it happens,


00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.260
you can look it up and figure out what to do.


00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.140
- At least know what it is.


00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.260
And you're kind of putting yourself in a space


00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.060
where you gotta know even a little more about it maybe, huh?


00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.180
- Right, so one of the things is that it covers things


00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.180
that the PSF sponsors also, sponsored spaces.


00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.020
This includes a couple different,


00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.900
two or three of the Python meetups around the country.


00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.060
They're not sponsoring us yet,


00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.860
although we probably should hit them up for that.


00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.180
But we are doing a meetup here in Portland West


00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.180
coming up next month.


00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.600
And yeah, we probably ought to think about this


00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.740
of what to do if something happens.


00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.180
So yeah, Michael and I will probably talk about this


00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.260
and before the actual meetup.


00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.080
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.


00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.700
What's the date of the meetup again for people?


00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.760
- Oh my gosh, I should know this.


00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.020
It's like the second Tuesday in October.


00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.660
So that's like the sixth or the eighth


00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.500
or something like that.


00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.580
- That would be the eighth.


00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.860
- The eighth, yeah. - Yes, eighth.


00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.700
Awesome, all right.


00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.140
Well, for those of you who could make it,


00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.460
that'd be great to see you out there.


00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.900
All right, now, speaking of great stuff,


00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.660
before we get on to more interviewing on my theme here,


00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.060
I wanna tell you about Datadog.


00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.500
So Python Bytes is sponsored by Datadog.


00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.340
They're a modern cloud-scale monitoring platform


00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.180
that brings things like metrics, logs,


00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.140
and traces all into one place.


00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.860
Their tracing client includes auto-instrumenting support


00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.660
for things like Django, Flask, Postgres.


00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.820
That means you get visibility


00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.340
into what your entire application is doing,


00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.620
not just maybe a trace out of your Python app


00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.340
or profiling just your Python app,


00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.900
but you can troubleshoot slow requests


00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.380
and optimize your code within a few minutes.


00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.820
So start monitoring your dynamic environment


00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.540
with a free trial


00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.600
and Datadog will send you a free t-shirt as well.


00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.100
Just get over to pythonbytes.fm/datadog to get started.


00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.700
So this previous one that I talked about, Brian,


00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.080
It was very much focused on sort of these,


00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.060
almost these data structure algorithm versions.


00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.140
And it said, here's the Python equivalent


00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.300
of some of these conversations you might have.


00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.380
This next one, I don't know how long it would take you


00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.460
to go through all this stuff,


00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.820
but it would take you a good long while.


00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.500
This is by Ben Rogagen, I'm gonna say,


00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.380
sorry about that if I got that wrong,


00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.180
goes by Seattle Data Guy.


00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.100
So it talks a little bit about some of the silly stuff


00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.160
like FizzBuzz and some of the traditional classical,


00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.840
I don't know, silly algorithm problems


00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.720
like give us the mth Fibonacci, et cetera, et cetera.


00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.000
And some things that you might study and so on.


00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.140
But then there's a bunch of videos.


00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.280
And I don't know how many videos.


00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.000
There are many, I would say at least 75 videos


00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.040
on different topics.


00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.320
And these are like 15 minute videos.


00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.480
So there's some on algorithms,


00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.480
there's some on data structures,


00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.200
there's some on big O notation,


00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.400
dynamic programming, string manipulation,


00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.760
system design, operating systems, threads,


00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.240
object-oriented programming, design patterns,


00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.240
SQL, and more stuff.


00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.860
So if you are in the process of trying to learn these things


00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.200
to get one of these jobs or nail one of these interviews,


00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.040
you've got homework.


00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.280
- Oh, okay. - That's a lot, huh?


00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.320
- This is frightening though.


00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.800
Yeah, awesome that this resource is here.


00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.680
Especially you can like pick a part where you,


00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.000
you know, had trouble with,


00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.680
or maybe after an interview even,


00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.560
and go, "Wow, I got asked this stuff


00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.920
and I didn't understand it, so maybe go review it then.


00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.080
I was just watching all of the different algorithms,


00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.720
sorting algorithms, I love videos of sorting algorithms.


00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.720
- I know, the visualizations, yeah.


00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.520
There's a big graphic of like 20 different


00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.600
sorting algorithms all sorting next to each other


00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.960
at the same time, right?


00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.240
Something like that. - Yeah.


00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.280
- It's mesmerizing.


00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.700
And also, I would say there are maybe 15 pages of comments,


00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.960
and the comments get kicked off like,


00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.120
I think we really need to face a reckoning


00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.400
in our profession.


00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.360
And the reckoning is this.


00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.920
we require an overload of stuff that's simply not important


00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.400
on the job just to get through the interview process


00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.320
and land a position.


00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.440
So basically, you've got to go through all these algorithms,


00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.240
kind of like I said.


00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.880
And then in the end, you do a lot of Googling,


00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.700
stack overflow, and you find packages on awesome Python,


00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.920
and then you install them and you roll.


00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.080
There's a huge discussion about why that is,


00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.680
what we can do about it, and so on.


00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.040
So I think it's great.


00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.640
You should also check out the conversation in the comments.


00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.480
On the other end of it, just a devil's advocate,


00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.480
one of the reasons I know people do pick up


00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.760
algorithm type questions is because


00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.960
they work in a specific space domain


00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.300
and it would be obvious to ask about that.


00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.400
But if they don't really,


00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.480
if they know they can train you on their domain,


00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.680
they have to ask you about stuff that is something generic


00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.900
and that's where the algorithm stuff is.


00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.640
I still think it's bad.


00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.120
Things like, what should you use,


00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.160
a bubble sort or quick sort?


00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.640
That's a dumb question.


00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.480
But if you have things like, I don't know,


00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.440
fizzbuzz is kind of silly, but you should know it by now.


00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.440
And some of the other things,


00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.520
it's hard to come up with good questions


00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.480
that are fair for anybody coming at it.


00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.720
So also, keep in mind that.


00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.480
- Yeah, you know what I would much rather see


00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.480
is something live and in the tooling and environment


00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.000
that that person likes to work in.


00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.980
So if I was interviewing somebody,


00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.480
it seems to me like I might set up like a Zoom call


00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.560
and we do screen share and say,


00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.720
hey, I would like you to create this kind of website


00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.760
and have it, you know, have a route that passes data


00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.420
to the view method or whatever, right?


00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.720
Like if it's a web job,


00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.280
or I'd like you to have a program that reads a JSON file


00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.240
and prints out these things and just say, okay, now go,


00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.080
let's do it.


00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.320
Talk me through building this app and spend 15 minutes.


00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.000
You can tell if somebody is comfortable in the language


00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.840
and comfortable in their tools, or they have just no idea.


00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.800
Like, I know that's what fizzbuzz is supposed to solve,


00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.760
but if you can't load a JSON file,


00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.320
which is like three lines of code,


00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.040
and it just works with dictionaries after that,


00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.800
you probably are not really capable in Python.


00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.720
So I would much rather see something like that,


00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.960
like a small task that's not super domain-specific,


00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.040
it's not really deep into some library


00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.600
that you could ask over all of these crazy things,


00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.840
and it seems like it'd be effective.


00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.200
So I don't know, that's my thoughts.


00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.360
- Definitely, cool.


00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.360
So one thing that does, I would really hope I don't get asked


00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.920
in interviews, is about is regular expressions.


00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.200
Because those things are like right only.


00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.120
- No, no, simple regular expressions are fine.


00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.960
- Okay.


00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.640
- In regular expressions defense,


00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.400
they're very useful to concisely say something,


00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.360
some string kind of matches some other string within,


00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.400
you know, anyway, people know what regular expressions


00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.480
are for, hopefully.


00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.320
If you're gonna interview, you probably should look it up.


00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.680
Yeah.


00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.140
- But one of the hard things though is if you,


00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.060
this is, I'm gonna introduce a project by Anthony Sotile,


00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.300
Sotile, Sotile, oh, anyway, sorry Anthony.


00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.580
Sotile, called re-assert.


00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.220
And so what this is, it's just a new matcher


00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.900
that does better tracebacks for when the match fails.


00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.420
And so this is really helpful if you've got,


00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.660
if you wanna do, use regular expressions for a test


00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.400
for part of your test for your application.


00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.740
This string should say,


00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.400
"Hello, Michael, welcome to my website."


00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.440
And I know that the name's going to be different,


00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.660
so I'm going to use a regular expression


00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.320
to parse out the name.


00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.400
How do I make sure that that matches


00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.560
and have a useful answer when it doesn't?


00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.400
And that's where reassert comes in.


00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.760
And it's pretty fun, and it's a fairly new project,


00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.840
so the documentation's a little on the light side.


00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.360
So I did what I often do with new projects is I jumped into the test code and looked at the test


00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:07.200
code for this to find out how it was used. And it's kind of fun. Like for instance, we're going


00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:15.040
to put in a show notes, an example of just matching foo with fob and how that if you use just re.match,


00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.120
it just returns a none. >> No match.


00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:25.600
>> Yeah, so it's not going to tell you anything. But if you use the matches object within the re


00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.480
assert project, it gives you more detail of why it doesn't match.


00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.000
So I think this is for very specific use cases.


00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.680
It's very cool.


00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.200
I love it because one of the really frustrating things about regular


00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.020
expressions is you say, here's the thing and it should match this.


00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.040
And it says, nope, doesn't match.


00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.460
Why don't you match?


00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.500
And this is really cool.


00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.320
So if, if you compare foo to fob, like foo is a regular expression, fob is


00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.080
value for static characters.


00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.560
It just matches, you know, just tries to find that substring basically.


00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.620
And the error is right here at the B it didn't match the F match the O match,


00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.520
but the B didn't match and that's super helpful.


00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:04.960
That's great.


00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.660
And there's a bunch of examples in, especially in test code, but yeah, so


00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.940
check it out and good job, Anthony.


00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.480
Absolutely.


00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.160
You know, there's a bunch of awesome Python lists these days, Brian.


00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:15.800
Yeah.


00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.000
We've got awesome ASGI.


00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.240
We've got awesome Python applications from Mahmoud.


00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.240
And we've talked a bit about Python typing and type hints and whatnot.


00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.240
So of course there's an awesome Python typing awesome list.


00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240
Okay, nice.


00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.240
Yeah, it's a collection of awesome Python types, stubs, plugins, and tools for working with them.


00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.240
So in terms of the tools, there's the static type checkers.


00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:47.240
There's stub packages, which define the types that go with other packages,


00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.240
which is pretty interesting, like typeshed.


00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.880
So instead of actually putting the types in the libraries,


00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.880
you can put them in these libraries that go next to your library,


00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.880
and it will actually pull that.


00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.080
It has stuff for Python 3.6, 3.7, standard library,


00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.960
like data classes, and all of those things.


00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.480
So yeah, it's pretty interesting.


00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.240
Put them in a PYI file, and it will carry the types over to--


00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:18.320
there's an example of data classes.py that'll apply the types to data classes.py.


00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:18.820
Oh, cool.


00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.900
So it's got a bunch of those.


00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.340
TypeShed is probably the biggest one there.


00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.900
It's got tools.


00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.140
This is like a super category of many other ones.


00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.780
But one I thought you might like is pytest mypy.


00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.420
So mypy static type checker plugin for pytest.


00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.340
I think we covered that one at some point.


00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.180
- Yeah, I think so.


00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.000
- Yeah.


00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.900
And then cool articles like how to type check Django


00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.240
and Django REST framework.


00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.380
So which is a whole tutorial on doing that.


00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.380
Apparently Django has a bunch of magic


00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.780
and it makes type checking it extra hard.


00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.060
So there's just a bunch of things like that in there


00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.180
that I thought people might,


00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.280
if they're getting into this Python typing space,


00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.940
it's a lot of good stuff to go check out.


00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.860
- And some of the, like even linters,


00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.100
'cause some people, I mean, you try one and it's confusing.


00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.060
Well, try another one.


00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.780
Maybe it fits better for what you're doing.


00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.140
- Yeah, there's a bunch of like eight


00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.700
and some, I think some black stuff


00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.700
and things like that in there.


00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.540
- Okay, cool.


00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.460
I haven't really worked with stubs yet.


00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.700
I think that's something I wanna try soon, so.


00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.540
- Yeah. - Neat.


00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.360
- Same here.


00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.200
What do you got for our last one?


00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.380
- Last one, oh, so we have actually,


00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.000
In the space of looking at people writing articles


00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.520
and speaking and stuff, we kind of do that a lot.


00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.120
We run across quite a few people


00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.360
that list developer advocate as their job title.


00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.880
And I don't really know exactly what that is.


00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.680
And I've asked a couple people


00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.120
and not quite understood it still.


00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.200
You did like an entire episode on it, didn't you?


00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.520
- I did, I did.


00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.340
- Okay.


00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.180
- I'm gonna see if I can pull up the number.


00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.840
The number is, I'm not sure what the number is.


00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.680
I gotta figure it out.


00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.500
I'll look, keep going.


00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:49.240
This is from Dustin Ingram, an article called Developer Advocacy Frequently Asked Questions.


00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:55.160
And the disclaimer he puts is that he is a developer advocate for Google.


00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.980
So other companies and other people might experience different things.


00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.480
But first off, just what is it?


00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.760
And he says he helps represent the Python community at Google in his sense, in his case,


00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.760
but really at whatever company somebody is working for.


00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.720
to get more involved with the Python community and then also try to represent the Python community


00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:21.080
within the company and represent the company in the community, that kind of both ends of it.


00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.880
He has a chance to work on different packages that he cares about. In Dustin's case, he works


00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:31.400
with the PyPI and with packaging and other things. Speaking at conferences, of course, that's what we


00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.120
assume. That's what I assume. But there are apparently some that don't do much speaking


00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.880
and conferences and some that just do like one or two a year, which that sounds fun.


00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.480
The thing that I think really sounds fun is being the user zero for new products or features


00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.480
for a company.


00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480
Yeah, that's pretty cool.


00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.920
With the bent of thinking about Python users and whether or not they like it and things


00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.920
like that.


00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.000
He's got a whole list of different things that they do, but actually this sounds like


00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
a lot of fun to me.


00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.240
Actually be kind of cool.


00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.440
I think this would be a great job.


00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.440
Yeah, I interviewed a couple of folks back on Talk Python.


00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.280
It was a lot of fun to do that episode.


00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.240
And yeah, I think it sounds like a great job.


00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.880
It's one of those jobs where you get to,


00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.140
you basically get to explore technology.


00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.800
Obviously, when you work for one of these companies,


00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.520
it's in the slant of that.


00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.640
So the three people I interviewed,


00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.960
Cecil Phillip from Microsoft,


00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.260
Paul Everett from JetBrains,


00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.720
and Matt McKay from Twilio,


00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.900
they all kind of work around their space.


00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.120
But I don't know, I think it sounds great.


00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.880
Like if you just like researching new stuff


00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.440
and playing with new ideas and talking to people,


00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.320
I would definitely do it.


00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.520
- I kind of assumed that they even address


00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.320
the work-life balance.


00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.480
There's some people that do like to travel a lot,


00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.000
so you can do that, and some people that don't.


00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.920
I thought that maybe that was just required for a DA, but--


00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.560
- Maybe, I'm not really sure either.


00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.520
But work-life balance is interesting, right?


00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.640
Because a lot of times those folks would be working


00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.960
from home when they're not gone.


00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.880
They might have more time with their family,


00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.240
more flexibility to go to their kid's soccer game,


00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.440
but then make it up in the evening.


00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.200
Whereas people go to office every day,


00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.040
maybe not so much.


00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.400
- Definitely, I guess it depends on your life, right?


00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.680
- That's right, what do you call balance?


00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.760
Okay, so you got any extra stuff you wanna share?


00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.560
We already gave a shout out to our Portland West meetup


00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.600
that you were doing out by your office.


00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.640
- That's all I wanted to shout out, how about you?


00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.480
- Yeah, that's on meetup.com, so people can check that out.


00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.360
Nothing major, there was some interesting news.


00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.440
We covered a while ago that some of Kenneth Wright's


00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.640
projects were being moved around.


00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.640
And the biggest domino in that whole space was requests.


00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.760
Can't remember exactly who jumped in,


00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.040
but someone from the PSF jumped in and said,


00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:42.880
"Hey, we'll take it.


00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.720
"We'll take care of it."


00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.160
And this thing called some project that the PSF runs


00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.920
that can take care of these types of projects


00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.080
when they become important


00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.240
and are teetering on being unowned or whatever.


00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.880
So there's a huge discussion on Reddit


00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.280
about how it actually has moved over.


00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.840
So it actually has moved over to the PSF for one.


00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.760
And so now the place for requests on GitHub, for example,


00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.960
is github.com/psf/requests.


00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.800
That's wild.


00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.880
But there's a huge discussion around it on Reddit


00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.400
and take that for what it is, it's Reddit.


00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.200
Like it's kind of a, you get both sides type of place,


00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.440
but I think people find it interesting.


00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.400
- I didn't really know that there was,


00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.440
actually there's quite a bit of stuff.


00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.280
There's a few projects under PSF.


00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.160
I imagine that will grow bigger now.


00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.440
- Yeah, I would think so as well.


00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.200
- Black is there, that's interesting.


00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.020
- How interesting.


00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.040
Are you ready for some laughs?


00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.880
- I am.


00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.220
- This one might hurt us a little bit.


00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.260
This is good.


00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.020
As in from laughing so hard.


00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.860
- Okay.


00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.760
- This one is called to our attention by Colin Martin.


00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.760
And it's a set of web development merit badges.


00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.960
Go ahead and pull up the link


00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.440
for where you can see the badges


00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.720
'cause you gotta see the picture


00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.440
that goes along with each badge.


00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.120
Let's take them like row by row.


00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.960
- Okay.


00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.800
- I'll do the first one.


00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.960
Each has a big circle


00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.460
and it's got like something in it.


00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.140
This one has a giant A, and it says,


00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.140
so you get this badge if you changed a DNS record


00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.740
and everything worked just fine.


00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.320
This one, I love this one.


00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.660
There's a forward slash bracket A dash brain bracket bracket


00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.560
and it says, comprehended someone else's regex.


00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.280
- Yeah, exactly, definitely.


00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.160
- And you just have a little bit of a webbed.


00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.960
Another one is like an expander thing,


00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.760
says built an accordion from scratch.


00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.680
- I've done that.


00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.400
- I think you've done this next one,


00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.520
- And one in the next row.


00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.640
- So colon WQ for exited vim.


00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.740
- Exited vim, I love it.


00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.580
You wanna do the next two?


00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.560
- Yeah, so, aw crud.


00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.720
Somebody, you get it if you accidentally created


00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.160
your own CMS.


00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.560
And then a little painter.


00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.320
I like the little painter with the acorn hat.


00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.480
- Yeah, it's like a French design painter.


00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.300
- Yeah, pulled off, you get this if you pulled off a design


00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.760
you didn't think you could.


00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.040
Well, that's actually kind of nice.


00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.040
- Yeah, this is nice.


00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.720
This next one is for the consultants out there.


00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.560
It's like a mallet banging down like a judge.


00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.440
And you get this one if you told a client or boss,


00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.000
no, we're not doing that.


00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.960
- Yeah, that's awesome.


00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.760
- Then there's one with like some crazy matching symbols.


00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.000
It says you wrote an HT access redirect


00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.640
that included a capture group.


00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.040
And then this one's pretty funny.


00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.680
You have a minus CSS pink and a plus CSS green.


00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.360
It says you refactored a large portion of CSS


00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.720
and you didn't break anything.


00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.400
- Oh yeah, that's good.


00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.240
There's some good ones.


00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.140
You want to just pick out a couple more?


00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:28.980
We can't do one thing.


00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.620
- Yeah, merged master into a six-month-old branch.


00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.580
- I love that one.


00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.200
There's like two arrows going sideways,


00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.040
two arrows going down.


00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.320
It says centered an element horizontally and vertically.


00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.200
- Oh, nobody can have that one.


00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.040
- That's so hard.


00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.680
- It's not possible, I don't think.


00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.680
- I don't think it is either.


00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.560
- I like the dude laying down on the ground,


00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.560
says you pushed to production on Friday


00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.920
and didn't roll it back over the weekend.


00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.340
- Here's an undecadent one.


00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.600
- How did a neglected site get hacked and spammed?


00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.360
- Oh yeah.


00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.600
- And then another one, there's a guy sleeping on a laptop


00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.120
and it says, "Solved a bug by taking a nap."


00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.200
- That's awesome.


00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.760
There's a semicolon for debugged something for over an hour


00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.800
where the fix literally was one character.


00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.120
- Awesome, yeah.


00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.180
All right, let's leave the rest for the listeners


00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.520
out there to go check out.


00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.680
You just gotta see the pictures.


00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.720
These are brilliant.


00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.560
- These are great.


00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.400
- Yeah, the first time I read it,


00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.200
Like, I was, my stomach hurt, it was really good.


00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.000
(laughing)


00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.600
All right, well, speaking of good, this was a fun show.


00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.720
Thanks, Brian. - Thank you.


00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.020
- You bet, talk to you later.


00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.760
- Thank you for listening to Python Bytes.


00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.220
Follow the show on Twitter @pythonbytes.
