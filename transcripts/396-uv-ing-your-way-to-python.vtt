00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.680
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.840
We deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.360
This is episode 396, recorded August 13, 2024.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.400
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.680
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.600
And this episode is brought to you by Scout APM.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.200
Thank you to Scout for their continued support of the show.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.440
Check out their link in the show notes.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.040
We'll tell you more about them later.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.800
If you want to follow us on the socials, you can find us all over on Mastodon.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.200
Links at the top of the show notes.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.000
And we are on X, although less active than we are on Mastodon, I would say.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760
We're going to catch the live show.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.520
You can do that at pythonbytes.fm/live.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.560
And it takes you either to the old ones or lets you know about the new one if it's running right there.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.960
So we appreciate when people are there, but audio always, always works as well.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.080
Brian, how are you doing?

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.200
I'm good.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.320
Yeah?

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.400
I didn't know we were still on X.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.600
But...

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.100
Well...

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.040
You're on X.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.640
Here's the thing.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.720
You're not on X anymore, okay?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.160
Did you actually delete your account?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.240
I have an account, but I check it like every other month or something like that.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.560
So...

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.760
I still get notifications if people will @ mention me.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.240
Oh, okay.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.320
I'll see it, but it's kind of the same thing.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.800
I don't like drop in and cruise through there as much.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.520
I'd be happy on Mastodon, but there's just, I would say 75% of the people that follow us,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.320
interact with us, at least through the show account, probably didn't make the transition.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.820
So...

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.320
Okay.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.640
I should pay attention more.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.360
So, apologies.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.560
Still there for them.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.960
Yeah.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.080
We're still there for them.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.800
Okay, good.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.280
That's all I meant by it.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.760
Okay.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.080
All right.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.840
Well, let's kick it off with your first item.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.320
Okay.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.680
I want to talk, I think I already, I covered UV, a UV article yesterday, or last week.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.240
Yeah.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.720
Well, it's the summertime and you got to be real careful about your UV index and put on your...

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.760
Oh, wait, no, not that.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.080
I love UV.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.920
Oh my God, we could put together a UV index.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.560
It'd be like the...

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.760
That would be awesome.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.520
Anyway, so I saw this article, Python packaging is great now, UV is all you need.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.160
And I'm like, I don't know.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.800
It seems like a little silver bullet dish for me.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.680
But I took a look at it anyway.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.480
This is from Juan Luis Cano Rodriguez, awesome name and cool profile picture.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.480
Anyway, so UV, what is, we like to bash on packaging, but it's

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.880
just continually getting better.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.960
And especially with people like Brett Cannon trying to continue to make it better, it's going

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.680
to, and people at UV, at Astral, making UV better.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.200
But so what is this about?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.640
This article, I didn't really want to completely cover the article, but there's some pretty cool

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.200
stuff here.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.000
So bootstrapping, getting a project started is difficult sometimes, or knowing what to do.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.880
And I've been using UV for making virtual environments, and it's really fast at that.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.120
But I took another look at it.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.600
There's been some updates that I didn't know it did some cool stuff.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.520
So one of the highlights here is UV Python, it manages Python versions.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.640
And I'm like, what?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.360
It does what?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.840
So I went and checked it out.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.920
And you can, so you don't even have to.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.680
So you can go down and say UV Python install, and it installs Python versions for you.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.160
And it's really fast, but you don't have to.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.240
And I'll tell you why in just a sec.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.040
You can install it like that, but you can also say UV Python list, and it lists all the Python

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.360
versions that it can find on your system.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.400
But if you say UV, V-E-N-V, so creating a virtual environment, you can give it a Python

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.240
flag with a number so you can do list ahead of time.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.200
And it tells you not only what versions are there, but also what versions it has available.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.480
So you can say, like, if you don't have 3.11 on your system, you can say 3.11 anyway, and

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.520
it'll install it.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.680
I'm like, does that really work?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.800
So I checked it out.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.360
I tried it.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.440
I personally, it said that it would just do it automatically if it wasn't there.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.640
But I had to add the Python.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.120
There's a flag called Python preference managed, and it's listed here somewhere.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.240
Anyway, Python preference managed.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.480
>> --Python preference.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.920
And then you can say UV managed, only managed, or managed system, or only system.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.480
Gotcha.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.040
Awesome.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.540
>> Yeah.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.360
Yeah, Python preference.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.880
But if you say managed, which is supposedly the default, but I had to pass it in anyway,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.600
it just does it.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.440
So I'm like, this is cool.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.080
And I installed, like, six versions of Python on my Mac yesterday in seconds.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.400
And just to have fun, to create virtual environments.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.400
And it's just neat.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.160
So I only really need a Python with -- I usually use Python within virtual environments.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.240
So being able to just install one into a virtual environment is cool.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.200
So what else can we do?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:17.120
So there's other things that UV can do that, like, it can initialize PyProject.toml for you.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.960
And it sets up -- if you do a net, it sets up PyProject.toml and a readme and a source layout.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.960
It doesn't do a lot, but it gets you started.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.120
The thing that I thought was neat is add.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.480
So you can add dependencies to your PyProject.toml with UV add.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.880
And so you don't have to look up the syntax for it.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.720
The other cool thing about it is you can give it the dev flag.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.440
You can say UV add --dev.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.960
Like, you can say --dev pytest, and it'll add pytest to your development dependencies,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.560
which is neat.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.040
So I guess I was going to say packaging is not solved with UV, but maybe it is.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.640
There's some pretty cool stuff.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.160
>> This is awesome, yeah.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.400
If you look up -- if you say UV help, there's a whole bunch of experimental items through here.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.640
So there's run, init, add.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.880
A lot of these are experimental features.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.760
Tree is cool.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.600
You can do a project dependency tree using UV.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.080
So there's a lot of stuff that I used to use other tools for that UV's doing.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.200
So kind of cool.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.880
Locking, creating lock files.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.680
>> I like the self.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.080
I like it.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.280
>> What does self do?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.520
>> Manage the UV executable itself.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.800
>> Oh, yeah.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.440
Okay.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.800
>> So there was a lot of drama, honestly, not on our show, but on the mailing lists

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.920
when this was announced.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.000
>> With UV Python?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.840
>> No, with UV pip.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.040
>> UV pip, yeah.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.400
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:53.200
And so the reason that Charlie and team chose UV pip as part of the CLI interface as a subcommand

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.840
was so that they had space to do all these other things.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.080
If you just said UV install, well, is that install the Python thing?

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.760
Is that install a package?

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.000
>> Oh, yeah.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.120
>> Right?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.800
And so they put that in there as almost like a namespace for all their commands and stuff.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.080
And how much new stuff is under these experimental sections, starting to feel like, okay, this

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.920
is what I had in mind, right?

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.800
>> Yeah.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.040
Yeah.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:23.520
So the experimental part makes me nervous to put it into my normal everyday workflow a

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.080
little bit.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.480
But for personal workflow stuff, why not play with it?

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.440
>> Yeah.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:27.840
>> So.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.000
>> You know, as you're going through this and seeing this title, Python packaging is

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.400
great.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.280
UV is all you need.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.720
I think it's all I use these days.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.920
I don't think I use anything else.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.520
>> There are some systems that the whole, especially with certain firewalls that I know

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.600
you can get around it with UV, but there are some systems that I work on where I have trouble

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.800
working with UV, but pip works fine.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.960
So.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.160
>> Oh, interesting.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.640
Okay.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.200
Yeah.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.560
I have basically three or four, maybe four or five aliases that are just like two or

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.440
three letters that will do all the combining, you know, like the full commands with this

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:01.840
and that.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.160
So those used to be pip commands.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.720
Now they're UV pip with like the different parameters and stuff.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.120
>> Yeah.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:14.320
And I tried, so when UV pip started, came, I tried to alias pip to UV pip and same with

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.360
virtual environment.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.400
But I realized that I kind of like control.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.240
I like to be able to use both.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.120
So I just sort of taught myself these UV commands.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.920
>> Yeah.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.880
Yeah.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.360
Sounds good.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.040
Not too hard, is it?

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.920
All right.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:35.120
Well, I have a set of bookends around Python versions to start and end the show here.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:42.880
So let's start with Python 3.12.5 was out just last week, came out right after the show

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.840
was released, I think.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.840
So we didn't cover it, but yeah, here we have a brand new version of the most recent version

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.640
Python.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.760
And I just checked by the way.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.480
>> What?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.280
>> Yeah.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:01.440
And I just checked with the UV Python list and I think 3.12.4 is the latest there, just

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.280
to give you a sense that like one week into it, apparently we don't have the latest.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.120
I was kind of hoping like that thing would be super cutting edge on top of it.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:16.240
So, but I wonder if I, you know what, it's possible that my UV is over a week out of

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.280
date and it doesn't know, right?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.760
Something like that.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.240
I don't know.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.880
Anyway, 3.12.5 is out.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.160
And if you scroll through, I'm linking to the release notes.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:32.000
Sometimes it's hard to find like what is actually changed in say 3.12.4 to 3.12.5, because if

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.480
you go to the, if you go to python.org and click on downloads, a lot of times it'll just

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.240
show like, well, here's what's new for 3.12.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.600
Be like, great.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.800
And from the last one that I had, the last one was that.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.240
But if you go, you can find the release notes at which I'm linking to.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.640
And so there are a lot of releases and changes in just this minor point release.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.200
So we've got a bunch of tests that are fixed.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.240
How about that, Brian?

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.120
That's great.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.760
Yeah.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.120
Two different security improvements, patches, I guess.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.920
You know, they're not, don't think they have CVEs.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.000
So there must not be too bad.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.280
Like audit, like missing audit events around certain behaviors.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.600
Like, okay, so you couldn't audit it properly, but it's not, it's not a, you know, all your

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.200
bases are belong to us sort of thing.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.440
Bunch of stuff in the library.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.840
So for example, a new version of pip.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.240
So for just a moment, just briefly, when you create a virtual environment, I won't say

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.600
your pip is out of date.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.120
But this, things like this, fix crash when importing SSL after the main interpreter starts.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.120
Hmm, might want to have that not happen.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.240
Handle value errors raised by os.stat.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.880
Fix some error messages in pickle.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.560
Here's one that's worth paying attention to.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.040
Fixed a seg fault in asyncio.task.getCoroutine.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.600
Okay.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.240
You know, a lot of times you think of, at least I think one of the really huge advantages

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.040
of Python is when stuff goes wrong, your program doesn't just go poof and go away.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.480
It, it reports the error.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.840
It gives you a chance to catch it, right?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.800
You like this, Python itself doesn't die.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.840
It knows it's something's gone terribly wrong and it shuts down.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.080
Right.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.840
But Python, CPython seg faults, then it just goes poof and goes away.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.120
So there's a ton of stuff like this.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.800
So I just wanted to call, call people's attention to all the changes here.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.440
And there's even some that look like performance.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.160
For example, what was it?

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.040
f-strings.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.640
If you have an F string that has just one entry into it, it, I think it used to create

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.200
an abstract syntax tree to try to build it up.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.120
And they're like, ah, not really needed all that stuff for a single F string.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.000
Our F string was single entry in it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.120
So, yeah, that's, that's going to be a nice performance improvement as well.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.120
Instead of dash, how do they F string it?

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.600
Yeah.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.680
So anyway, these are all good things.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.880
Yeah, definitely.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.040
f-strings are getting, getting more secure, more fast, more faster, better.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.320
Faster, better, stronger.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.240
We have the technology, we can rebuild it.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:52.640
Okay.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.840
Can you even imagine going back to the time before f-strings?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.360
It was a dark time.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.360
It was a dark time.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.160
My percent, my percent key still has no, no characters on it.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:04.720
No, just kidding.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.400
Yeah.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.280
Yeah, indeed.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.600
Okay.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.520
And before we go on to the next one, you were probably going to give us some really

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:17.520
awesome segue there, but let's talk about, ScoutAPM before we move on.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.080
Okay.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.760
Let me tell you real quick about ScoutAPM.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.520
They're big supporters of Python Bytes.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.280
So we appreciate that very much.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.640
So if you are tired of spending hours trying to find the root cause of issues impacting

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.560
your performance, then you owe it to yourself to check out ScoutAPM.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.520
They're a leading Python application performance monitoring tool, APM, that

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.760
helps you identify and solve performance abnormalities faster and easier.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.320
ScoutAPM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks, slow database queries, background

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.120
jobs, and the dreaded N plus one queries that you can end up if you do lazy loading

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.640
in your ORM, then you say, Oh no, why is it so slow?

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.040
Why are you doing 200 database queries for what should be one?

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.480
So you can find out things like that.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.320
And it links it back directly to the source code.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.880
So you can spend less time in the debugger and healing logs and just finding the

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.920
problems and moving on.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.880
And you'll love it because it's built for developers by developers.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.720
It makes it easy to get set up.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.040
Seriously, you can do it in less than four minutes.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.920
So that's awesome.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.440
And the best part is the pricing is straightforward.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.320
You only pay for the data that used with no hidden overage fees or per seat pricing.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.800
And I just learned this, Brian.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.000
They also have, they provide the pro version for free to all open source projects.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.640
So if you're an open source maintainer and you want to have ScoutAPM for that project,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.760
just shoot them a message or something on their pricing page about that.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.440
So you can start your free trial and get instant insights today.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.080
Visit pythonbytes.fm/scout.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.480
The link is in your podcast player show notes as well.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.440
And please use that link.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.680
Don't just search for them because otherwise they don't think you came from us.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.040
And then they'd stop supporting the show.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.840
So please use our link pythonbytes.fm/scout.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.640
Check them out.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.720
It really supports the show.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.840
Over to you, Brian.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.400
Alrighty.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.880
I want to talk about talks a little bit.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.080
We haven't talked, actually brought up talks for a while, I don't think.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.440
But there's an article on Victor Remark, Victor Remark's blog,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:19.200
about compile and use dependencies for multiple Python versions with talks.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.640
And it's kind of a neat idea.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:29.360
I use talks for incorporating it with GitHub actions a lot to be able to,

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.640
well, and just locally to be able to test multiple Python versions

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.240
and multiple versions of different libraries, how they work together.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.600
Talks is great for things like that.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.160
But one of the things that I didn't think about was doing pinning,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:50.000
like compiling pinned list or lock lists for dependencies for multiple Python versions.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.600
And so this article walks you through kind of why you would want to do that,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.880
but then also how to.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.600
And the little trick here, which I think is cool,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.440
is that talks uses an environment name called the env name.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:09.040
And so there is a way to be able to specify,

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.440
use that to look at different, the talks environment that it created,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.480
because it creates a little virtual environments when it's running.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.320
But the neat thing about that is you can use it other places.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.520
And the idea around this was to go ahead and use,

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.680
this article uses pip tools, but really I think you could use anything,

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:36.160
but to target a compile like a pip tools compile and send it to,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.720
it's using pip compile and using pyproject.toml as the base file,

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.360
and then outputting to a requirements env name, which is,

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:52.880
or a env.text or a, like a env-dev.text.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.800
So you could do like a requirements with a requirements file,

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.120
essentially with your environment specified in it.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.760
You could, in this example, it's using a directory,

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.640
pumping them all into a requirements folder with a directory,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.800
but you could also do a directory.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.120
And then also, I also like to have a requirements-whatever.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.760
So even if I had them all filed into a directory,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.240
I usually put something like requirements-312.text

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.040
or something like that.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.520
But having that, be able to specify it from the project,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.520
allows the little trick to be able to say,

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.640
oh, here's an example of with the requirements-,

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.840
I like that a little bit better.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:42.720
But to have a requirements target within talks,

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.760
so that you can use that to compile your project,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.160
compile those and while they're running,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.480
instead of like in CI or something could grab those.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.720
And instead of generating a, just whatever it can find,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.400
it's a pinned or a locked set of dependencies.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.080
It might be a little bit more consistent.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.960
So, so that locally, the, and the idea would be then,

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.320
locally, you, when you're testing yourself,

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.040
you can say, hey, I'm ready to update my dependencies.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.760
And then it regenerate the, all of the,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.360
all of the dev files and then, or all the lock files.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:24.240
And then later, when you're, when CI is running,

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.680
it doesn't look up dependencies.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.200
It just like knows the fixed links or the fixed versions.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.800
So kind of a neat idea.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.000
I wanted to highlight that.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.760
I also wanted to highlight this because I wanna,

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.160
I like this idea, but I wanna do it with UV.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.720
And I wanna, I'd like to be, I think I'll play with this,

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.640
but if anybody else has time to play with this

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.720
and see if they can get it working with UV,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.400
I'd love to see the outcome.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.440
So, yeah, that's awesome.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.440
I imagine you can, because if it was using pip-tools,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.640
you know, it's got the pip compile behaviors.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.920
It shouldn't be that hard.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.960
Yeah, yeah, it's awesome.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.840
Yeah, this looks great.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.340
I love it.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.680
What do you got for us?

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.680
You, let's, let's close it out with, I think dark.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.760
I did tell you it was the 13th, didn't I?

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.040
Yeah.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.040
So I present to you a, this is not exactly a Python thing,

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.160
but I feel like this is anyone who builds web apps

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.960
or other types of apps and interacts with,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.640
you know, users sort of thing.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.880
So super set, if you will.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.640
I present to you a catalog of dark patterns for software.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.720
Says, discover a variety of dark pattern examples

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.280
sorted by category to help you better understand

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.760
deceptive design practices.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.240
So there's some that you probably would know

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.120
like bait and switch.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.160
And each one of these has at least one concrete,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.040
like case study of evil, badness of darkness, let's say.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.320
So the bait and switch one, which says this tactic lures users

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.600
with an enticing offer only to change the terms unexpectedly.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.320
So they've got a lift 60% off.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.560
Wouldn't you like 60% off of your next ride?

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.480
Just click here and sign up, right?

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.480
And then once, actually your next two ride

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.600
that says right here.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.000
Yeah.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.720
But then actually, as you try to apply it,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.840
it turns out it only counts towards 60%

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.960
off the first $10.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.120
So if you like went to the airport, it was 50 bucks.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.320
It's like, well, you know, it's still 44.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:20.960
Yeah, perfect.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.840
So that's not ideal.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.680
To me, the classic bait and switch is the cable companies

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.280
for internet or anything.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.400
Like, don't you want to add like a home phone,

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.680
like digital phone?

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.240
And then you can add like the sports package

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.280
and it's only $5 more for the first, you know,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.440
for the first six months.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.360
And then it's like $150 more.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.760
So I had one just like yesterday.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.760
I had an email from my cell phone provider that said,

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.480
since you've been here, like so many numbers of years,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.160
we're going to give you 10% off.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.200
I'm like, that's cool.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.000
And I clicked on it and it was 10% off

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.080
any of your case purchases.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.560
(laughing)

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.360
So shady.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.120
So shady.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.360
So that, I mean, people probably know that one,

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.840
but there's other ones that are interesting.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.600
Like one that I really like is the Roach Motel.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.240
Okay.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.840
So what is that?

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.040
Oh, it's this dark pattern usually used for subscriptions,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.040
making it easy to sign up, but nearly impossible to cancel.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.360
So there's, you know, you can't,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.760
there's not like a just unsubscribe us button.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.120
You've got to call somebody

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.800
and they try to talk you out of it.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.080
Like I'm a hat tip the cable companies again on this.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.600
Right.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.480
But yeah.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.640
One click subscribe.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.400
But if you want to, if you want to cancel,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.360
please come down to our office during hours of four and three.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.280
Exactly.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.240
Exactly.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.240
And if you don't get through the line of people backed up,

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.840
trying to get out of it, then you'll, you'll do bad.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.800
Try again the next week.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.760
So there's a bunch of these.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.640
I'll do one more.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.640
Just the people can go play with them.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.400
Disguised ads.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.640
Oh, I thought it was disgusting ads.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.360
Disguised ads.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:01.680
Okay.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.960
Disguised ads, which are themselves disgusting,

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.760
but the pattern is disguised.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.480
So Microsoft edge, for example,

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.760
and I feel like Google, this is towards Google Chrome,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.840
like a thing towards,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.480
I feel like it's also kind of reverse a lot of like,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.440
Google does that as well.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.920
Like, wouldn't you rather use this instead

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.040
when you search for something?

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.760
Anyway, I'll give you the example that's on the page.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.840
So you may encounter not one, but two dark padding patterns

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.440
when attempting to get Google Chrome onto your computer.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.560
When you have Microsoft edge,

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.280
this happens when you have a empty install of windows,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.280
you have edge installed, but not Chrome.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.400
And, or, I mean, I feel like installing Chrome itself

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.400
as a dark pattern that you should just avoid.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.680
Use of all the brave Firefox, something else.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.840
But anyway, that's not the point.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.040
There's two here.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.440
And the first one is disguised ads.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.440
The second one is confirm shaming.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.040
And so this is like a good case here.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:03.280
So if you go over to google.com/chrome in edge

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.520
and you go to the, you go to the,

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.200
like the, where you get to download it,

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.960
it literally has a built into the browser pop-up

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.720
that comes out of the menu bar.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.720
You know, that dress bar rather says,

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.200
I hate saving money, said no one ever.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.560
Microsoft edge is the best browser for online shopping.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.520
(laughing)

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.400
Just by literally visiting the Chrome page,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.720
you get this pop-up that's like integrated,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.240
not into the HTML, but into the UI of the browser.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.520
- That's so funny.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.200
- Yeah, so that's, that's shady.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.160
That's one.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.720
- I kind of love the boldness of that though, actually.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.080
(laughing)

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.040
- I know.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.720
And then if you go to, go to Bing, I believe this,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.240
which is the default search engine,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.440
and you just search for Chrome, you get some results.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.680
But then there's like this other part.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.440
Oh no, this is actually in the start, the start menu.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.040
This is in the start menu.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.840
So if you type Chrome, you're like trying to run Chrome.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.440
(laughing)

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.720
Half of the whole start menu says, try Bing wallpaper.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.920
Switch to the browser recommended by Microsoft.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.640
Default edge.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.880
- Dude, that's rough.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.440
Yeah, so what's cool is that it says, look,

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.800
here like it kind of highlights the various patterns

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.680
that are here and then like other companies

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.120
that do similar patterns.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.200
Anyway, I think this is interesting reading.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.840
I think figuring out, like just being aware of this stuff.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.160
So if you're involved in building these things,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.320
you're like, hey guys, people are gonna not like us.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.480
Could we do this a little bit differently?

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.080
You know, sometimes marketing will win.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.440
Sometimes developers will win.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:41.680
- So are these dark patterns or maybe growth hacking?

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.240
- Yes, is this our yacht or is this a dark pattern?

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.920
Could it be both?

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.640
- What could I incorporate these into?

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:50.880
No.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.080
- Yeah, it's like, #EUWin if you can get like all dark patterns.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.760
- Oh, that'd be fun to try to.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.880
- It'd be a good growth hack

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.040
'cause then you could appear under every category.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.480
It'd be like some like link.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.440
- Pre-advertising.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.560
- Exactly, yeah.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.760
Anyway, this is what I got for you.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.480
Kind of interesting.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:08.960
- Nice.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.960
- Extras, you got any extras you wanna share?

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.440
- The extra I wanted to shout out was just,

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:21.280
I think I have my recording done for Hellopytest.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.000
The only thing left to record is the summary at the end.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.200
There's a few things I wanna,

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.120
like one extra video I wanna record,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.040
but I wanna edit everything first.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.800
So I'm in the process of editing

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.400
and keeping track of everything

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.080
so that at the end I can go,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.920
"Hey, we went through all these things."

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.160
So I wanna make sure.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.640
Actually, the thing that I have left is

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.280
I want to review all of the command line flags

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.720
that I use in the course,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.200
but I don't remember all the ones I've used.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.120
So I'm writing down as I'm editing.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.480
- Nice, that's awesome.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.720
- But I'm on track for August 19th.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.560
A few people have ordered already.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.760
Thank you so much, everyone that's ordered so far.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.440
So love you.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.320
My wife loves you.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.000
We went out to get coffee off of money we got from this.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.280
- Beautiful.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.960
Yeah, available for pre-order now.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.440
- Yeah.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.960
What you got?

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.080
- I have just a couple things.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.520
Django 5.1 released.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.840
So big deal here is easier guardrails for authentication

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.720
'cause having people access stuff

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.080
that was supposed to be authenticated,

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.280
but isn't is bad.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.640
They didn't say that, that's my words.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.600
The new and shiny login required middleware

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.040
is available which enforces authentication for all views.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.320
Better screen reader support, better HTML semantics.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.200
The second oldest ticket is now fixed

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.040
with a long awaited query string template tag.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.800
So these things are all good.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.520
And let's see, what's there?

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.160
Yeah, I thought there might've been a CVE

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.240
or something in here, but I don't think so.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.600
I saw Django CVE not too long ago, security deal,

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.160
but it doesn't seem like it's addressed with this one.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.840
So it must've been fixed previously.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.920
All right, so that, and then here's the bookend.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.760
We started with 3.12.5 being available.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.720
Well, how about Python 3.13 looking forward

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.200
with release candidate one is out.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.600
So this happened a little bit ago,

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.360
but if you're out there and they say,

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.280
"Please test, you have a package,

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.560
especially a popular one,

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.960
please test it with Python 3.13 ahead of time

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.160
so we can do stuff about it."

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.000
And you're like, "Oh, it's betas.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.360
I'm not gonna take the trouble.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.400
I'm not gonna worry about it."

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.080
Well, it's now officially stable in terms of features, right?

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.560
They're not gonna add or remove things ideally

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.080
unless they absolutely have to.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.880
So you should be able to properly start putting energy

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.200
into testing and playing with this one.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.320
And this one is a big deal

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.680
because this is the first free threaded Python,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.160
which is gonna have significant effects

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.320
on runtime behavior, not just the API still work, right?

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.800
So it's gonna be worth testing with this one.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.480
- All those other versions of Python

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.680
you have to pay for threading.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.720
This one's free threading.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.840
- Yeah, it's awesome.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.240
Finally, it's free.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.040
You just have, yeah, you have to pay by buying other machines

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.000
and running copies on them to get parallels.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
- No, so I was hoping that UV Python

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.400
would have 3.13 there, but it doesn't yet.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.760
So we'll just- - Yeah, that would,

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.080
all right, UV team out there listening.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.760
- Just Astro, come on Astro, what are you doing?

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.760
- Exactly, let's turn UV Python into like,

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.760
this is how I get the freshest Python,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.400
which is actually one of the things that's a little tricky.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.720
Like homebrew, it takes a week for that stuff to show up

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.000
and other stuff, yeah.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.800
- A week?

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.240
Yeah, who wants week old coffee?

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.840
- No, no, your threads are totally stale by now.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.920
(both laughing)

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.280
- It's a goofy episode, man.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.640
- It is, all right.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.080
I know you got the joke for us this week, so take us out.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.320
- Well, actually, before we get onto this,

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.680
I was just thinking, because you,

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.920
when you were talking about Django,

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.560
I thought of a new, of a dorky joke.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.040
So what do you call a 17 year old insect?

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.480
A minor bug?

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.280
- Oh, that's pretty good.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.280
- Okay, so I saw this Ars Technica, is it Ars or A-R-S?

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.720
I don't know, Ars Technica?

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.880
- I say Ars, but I know now you say that,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.080
I'm not sure I've ever heard anyone pronounce it.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.240
So go with Ars, 'cause it's lowercase.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.800
- Ars Technica, had an article,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.920
"Parody site Clownstrike refuses to bow down

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.120
"to Cloudstrike's bogus DMCA takedown."

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.280
So there's an article here, I wanted to check it out myself.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:44.960
So if you go to clownstrike.lol, and we'll refresh it.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.640
See if it, it starts out looking like Crowdstrike,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.400
but it has a little goofy hat on it.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.760
And then if you, I'm not gonna play the music now,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.960
but if you play music, it's got like some goofy little music

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.960
that goes along with it, and there's a clown.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.960
That's it, it's just funny.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.800
But now if you click on the left,

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.960
it tells you about all this,

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.200
well, it tells you the Ars Technica article,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.120
but it also talks about this story

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.440
about how they had these takedown,

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.480
Crowdstrike tried to take them down,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.000
and it's just silly.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.080
There's some other stuff here too

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.520
that I think is just hilarious.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:27.440
Like the, what, scam advisor lists clownstrike.lol

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.000
as a highly trusted, might be safe.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.040
It's like nothing there,

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.960
except for just this goofy little picture.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.120
But there are some other stuff in it.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.760
You can read the whole story and all the letters about,

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.480
or all the emails back and forth about the takedowns.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.000
And actually, I was surprised to find out

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.360
that they had to, like Cloudflare was hosting this,

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.320
but it like accepted the takedown at first,

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.960
and eventually backed down,

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.440
but even after, but after it got moved.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.040
But I'm surprised that it got taken down so fast

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.400
because obviously this is a parody site,

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.320
and parody is protected.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.960
There's no way, like even a cursory look at this,

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.920
anybody would think this is a realistic violation.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.920
Yeah, it's not trying to impersonate it

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.120
or anything like that, for sure.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.360
No, just making fun of the situation.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.600
And I think that they just probably,

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.440
I mean, they really should have just ignored it

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.520
because now clownstrike is known,

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.560
and we're talking about it,

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.320
and Ars Technic is talking about it, anyway.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.840
Exactly.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.000
It's the Barbra Streisand effect, right?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.500
Yeah.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.400
So.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.360
Oh boy.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:39.920
Anyway.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.640
Yeah, I'm somewhat sympathetic to CrowdStrike,

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.320
but this is a bad look.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.800
You know, if you've got to write native code

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.000
that runs in the kernel,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.920
I think the smallest mistake,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.240
and it has to be like updated within hours

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.080
of you learning new information,

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:54.720
I don't know.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.360
It's tough.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.680
Apparently it's one of the best antivirus systems out there

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.360
that actually works and isn't just,

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.800
you know, you want to talk dark patterns,

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.000
like a lot of this antivirus,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.440
clean your computer stuff is really shady.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.360
But boy, did they cause a problem,

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.520
and I would not want to be in their shoes.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.320
No.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.680
Well, I don't know.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.760
I mean, a couple of weeks of shame

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.440
over you get billions of dollars to pay for that shame.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:19.940
So.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.400
Yeah, I think they're going to get a lot of lawsuits

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.560
from a lot of angry Fortune 500 companies.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.760
And even if they win,

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.920
defending them is going to hurt them bad.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.760
If it doesn't kill them, it's going to hurt them bad.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.400
So.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:30.960
Okay.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.280
So.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:31.680
Yeah.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.920
Sympathies out there for somebody?

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.420
Some.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.960
A little bit.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.160
A little bit.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:38.800
A little bit.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.280
But I feel like they've certainly earned this website.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.920
And wow, I didn't know LOL was the top level domain.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.600
Yeah.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:45.840
It's funny.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.560
It makes me laugh.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.280
Yeah, it makes me laugh.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.280
I wonder what that stands, what it is.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.840
Is it like a country or something?

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.280
Is it literally LOL?

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.240
Like laugh out loud?

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.840
Or is it because they're like .pizza is the top level domain as well,

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.880
which just seems wrong.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.880
Oh, that does seem wrong.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.960
Really?

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:03.520
I think so.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.400
I'll have to check that out.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.280
Like pepperoni.pizza and like, you know, Hawaiian.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.080
Honestly.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:08.800
Yeah.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.440
Pineapple.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.880
Maybe we need to get some domains.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:11.840
Yeah.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.340
Anyway.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.440
Okay.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:13.760
Awesome.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.320
Thanks for sharing.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.280
This is great.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:15.680
All right.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.320
Thanks for being here.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.120
Like always.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.760
Thank you.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.240
Bye.
