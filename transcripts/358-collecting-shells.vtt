Wonderful.


00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.880
So Brian, you have a big, big time release to talk about. Want to tell the people?


00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:44.640
Yeah. So there's been a Django, Django beta, beta one released. So Django, sorry, Django 5.0


00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.520
beta one. So we're now, we're now in the 5.0 world of Django. So we're linking to the, to the


00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.360
basically announcement. But what I think is interesting is, oh, I didn't see the schedule.


00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.360
So let's take a look at the release schedule. It looks like, so we've got the beta now,


00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.640
October 23. There should be a release candidate, November 20th and the final by December. So by


00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.920
the end of the year, there'll be a final.


00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.000
Are you saying we're going to get Django 5.0 for Christmas?


00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.200
Before, to get ready for Christmas. Yeah. Honey, can you help me wrap presents? No,


00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.640
I got to play with Django 5. So I'm pretty excited about this. It looks pretty cool. Let's


00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.800
look at some of the, some of what we got. There's a release notes under development because it's


00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.600
still just the first beta, but there's some really cool stuff. One thing to note, I think we, we may


00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.360
have mentioned this before, but I can't remember that Django 5.0 only supports 3.10, 11 and 12.


00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.080
So they're, that's the last time we were talking about, oh, can't believe we're saying goodbye to


00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.760
3.7. Yeah. And they're like, you know what? That's, we'll go into the future, baby. 3.10 and above.


00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.600
Well, you know, and I, I actually think this is decent because there's some fun stuff in 3.10 and


00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.360
above, and I haven't had any issues like upgrading any of the projects I've worked on. They've been


00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.120
maybe minor things. So the, the last, the last few have been really easy upgrades, I think.


00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.880
But you know, other, your mileage may vary. There's a note about third-party library support


00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.440
for older versions of Django and mostly it's, you know, how to deal with looking for warnings. So


00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.040
you should be, if you don't support older, or if you're planning on not supporting new versions


00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.440
of Python or Django or whatever, you should put warnings in and then people can run with,


00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.800
with warnings on with dash capital W and the D for deprecation. So to look for deprecated warnings.


00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.760
And that's, that's really kind of a cool thing that a lot of, most package maintainers do this.


00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.160
So that's pretty great. Okay. So what's new facet filters in the admin. I have no idea what this is.


00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.600
I don't know what this is, but it sounds neat. So that's cool. The thing that I really was pretty


00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.240
excited about was the simplified templates for form field rendering. So you know, when you're


00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.440
creating a form there's a lot of ways to help you create forms. There's extra plugins like


00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.560
crispy forms and others, but this looks great. So look, this is the before picture. This is the


00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.960
before form. There's a lot in that form. This is the after it's just a few lines of code. It's


00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.120
really great. So for, for those of you listening, of course, check out the show notes and you can


00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.840
link, you can see the link for where the release notes are. So just like maybe three or four lines


00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.200
of code versus 20 ish. I mean, it's not terrible, but it's also kind of confusing. So, and this is


00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.160
just an email form with email and password or sign in form or something. So this is pretty cool.


00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.720
Yep. There's more excitement to come database computed default values. This is, this is


00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:01.040
actually a pretty big deal. I think this, because things like now for a timestamp, well, now on your


00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.680
computer or now on the server or now it's now you've got one server running the database and,


00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.400
and that so that'll be like a consistent time across everything, but there's a whole,


00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.120
go ahead. Sorry. With, with a lot of these, like that, that default in the ORM that happens on,


00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.320
it happens in Python, which means it happens on the web for an end server along with all their


00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.720
times and latency. So there could be a little mismatch, but if your server or your database


00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.840
servers in a different time zone or something, it could be really out of whack. The other is if you


00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.960
have it set up a default that goes into the schema instead of just in Python, some other tool


00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.760
creates something. It will also take on those defaults, which is I think the bigger deal.


00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.960
Oh, okay. Cool.


00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.240
Right. Because if you use some database admin thing, you say insert this and this,


00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.480
but you're not doing it in Python. Well, normally database defaults would kick in,


00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.200
but not previously if it was just in Python, right?


00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.080
Yeah. And so if, if you're using, right, especially if you're using different tools,


00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.600
also having database defaults is a, is a, is an awesome thing, but it's plus it saves,


00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.120
it's faster, probably. I don't know. It seems like it might be faster. There's also database


00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.680
generated model field. So you can have your database generate fields based on other fields


00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.560
and have that be done in the database. So that's pretty cool. And there's, they give,


00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.120
they give some examples in here and then more options for declaring field choices.


00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.240
This hasn't been something I've run into, but apparently that's the current set and we have


00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.480
new set. We can do things like integer fields and stuff. I think, Oh, also there's like a,


00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.240
I don't know, there's a different API for this. And if it's been an issue, hopefully it's not


00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.720
an issue for you anymore. But anyway, and then a bunch of other minor features, but I'm sure


00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.640
there's been tons of bug fixes and everything like that too. So this is pretty exciting.


00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.200
That's pretty cool. That, that, that other one, those new types of fields,


00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.240
it looks like it supports string enumerations. Oh, okay. Which is pretty cool. If you go back


00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.360
down to that example there, I'm declaring field choices. Yeah, I think so. Like see how it says


00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.160
choices, metal dot choices. So you could have a, a, a gold, silver or bronze. Oh, right. Option.


00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.000
And those are the only three string values instead of it's just a string. It's like basically a


00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.760
string enumeration type thing, which is pretty cool. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Neat. While we're talking


00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.640
about Django, I want to go ahead and do it. This was going to be an extra, but I thought I'd go


00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.000
ahead and call out that Django, the Django, there's a couple of things. There's Django,


00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
not Django, not space, which we covered a few episodes ago, which is a place where you can


00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.280
kind of with, with mentors, learn about Django or learn about how to help maintain Django. Maybe


00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.040
this is a, this Django, not space is now accepting applications for the next contributor


00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.280
mentorship cohort. So, and I think I saw today that it's the, they're accepting applications


00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.560
through mid November, I think. So not that long though. So get on that. And if you would like to


00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.080
do it, and then there's also, they're also doing a survey along with in, in in collaboration with


00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.760
JetBrains and the Django software foundation. So go ahead and if you're a Django person,


00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.040
fill out the survey, be nice. And then when we get results, we can maybe cover it on the episode


00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:29.440
also. So yeah, that'd be great. All right. This next item, Brian is inspired by you. Okay. Okay.


00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:36.640
So last week we were talking about Windows terminal. We were talking about the get bash


00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:44.640
CMD thing for Windows, whatever the heck it's, it's called the, the bash shell that comes with


00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.520
get when you install it on Windows. And I said, Hey, why don't we just add that to the Windows


00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.400
terminal? And you're like, wait, the Windows terminal, Windows terminal is of course,


00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.400
something that Windows 10 or above can give it you have, you don't have it, you have to go to


00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.280
the Windows store and install it. It's pretty awesome. It comes with a bunch of different


00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.880
shells like command prompt, PowerShell, Windows subsystem for Linux, Azure, whatever you got


00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.680
installed down in the subsystem, I suppose. Pretty cool. It even has GPU acceleration for the


00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.600
text rendering, which is kind of cool, you know, motivated by warp, right? Because they were


00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.200
they're programming like metal on the GPU for their, their stuff. So, you know, so are they


00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.760
here on the Windows one, but I wanted to talk about adding it because if you just go to the


00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.960
get bash command prompt command and try to take that and stick it into the Windows shell, it


00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.920
doesn't actually work it, you click, show me the shell and all it does is launch command prompt


00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.000
and another window with the get bash. I'm like, huh, that's not doing it. So I found this article


00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.960
called add get bash to Windows. It has this real helpful message at the bottom here, Brian, it


00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.920
says, you're seeing this message because adder script blocking software is interfering with this


00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.760
page, disable any adder script. It's not interfering, it's blocking malware delivered over


00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.600
retargeting networks. So I'm helping them with their wording here and they can then correct that


00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.440
later. Anyway, you it's a super simple way that just walks through that ended up basically it


00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:18.240
shows you how to go and add a new profile. But most importantly, what the actual thing that is


00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.360
the the profile command that you need to add, which is not the same thing as you launch normally.


00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.120
So you just add that. Okay, pretty cool. Yeah. And it shows you how to even set the icon if you


00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.520
wanted to have the right icon in the drop down. And finally, you can even set it as the default.


00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.280
So if you just open Windows terminal, it defaults to the bash from git version. But then of course,


00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.160
you get the drop down. So like, here's what my Windows machine looks like. After I set this up,


00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.560
you've got Windows PowerShell, command prompt, Azure Cloud Shell, PowerShell, which is different


00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.440
than Windows PowerShell. It's the older one, like apparently, the developer command prompt for VS


00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:00.240
Visual Studio 2022 PowerShell for the same thing, and the bash one, which is pretty cool. And then


00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.680
yeah, so if people want to take and make their Windows shells better, here's one more option.


00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.680
And if you're on Mac, you can check out warp as well, because we talked about that last time. And


00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.080
I have more to say about shells later. So what funny thing about happened between last week and


00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:22.160
this week, my laptop died. Oh, no. And you didn't try to do this and kill it? Did you? No. What


00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.160
happened to it? I think the fan was just freaking out or something. Okay. And so I grabbed a,


00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:35.600
this was a work thing. So I got a new laptop and it came with Windows 11 and this was already


00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.960
installed. So, okay. I don't know if it automatically does it or if my IT department did it


00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.280
for me. Yeah. I don't know. It probably is already installed on Windows 11, but not Windows 10. I


00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:52.400
don't think. But then when I loaded a Windows bash or get for Windows, it just did this like


00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.720
on Windows 11, it just installed it in the right place. And so I can. Oh, that's pretty cool. It


00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.120
registered one of these profiles or something, huh? Yeah. Yeah. So that was cool. Excellent.


00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.880
Yeah. Excellent. I think, you know, if you're going to use one of these alternate shells on


00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.840
Windows, you might as well use this like nice front end container thing. And you know, the


00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.880
funny thing was, is I was, I was worried about it because most of our, I'm used to like worrying


00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.880
about operating system changes because of the compile dependencies and stuff. But we're doing


00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.440
all of our compiles in Docker images now and it's like, oh, I don't actually have to care about that


00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.200
anymore. So that's nice. We were running Windows seven. Who cares? Wait a minute. I don't know if


00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.840
you can get Windows Docker desktop to run on Windows seven, but you know, I know that was a


00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.600
joke. You probably cannot, but even if you can, you probably should not. All right. I think that's,


00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.760
yeah, that's the last, that's the last I got to say about that. So if you're on Windows and


00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.520
definitely check out the Windows terminal, which is a much, much nicer than command prompt and,


00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.280
you know, plug in your shells and then we can talk more later some other time about like,


00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.200
oh my posh, which I think I've talked about before. Well, I gotta get, I still want to


00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.320
get set up on that. So, yeah. Oh, it's so much better. Yeah. It's so good. Okay. Well,


00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:11.680
should we talk about testing a little bit? Yes, sure. So the, here's an article from Alex Jacobs,


00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:18.000
mastering integration testing with FastAPI. And I know it's focused on FastAPI, but it's just kind


00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.320
of a really pretty good walkthrough of, of different types of testing for a website or,


00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.320
well, an API at least. And that's, it's pretty great. So first off really quick description of


00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:37.520
what a integration testing is. And it's, I've, I've had a hard time describing what integration


00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:44.480
testing is to other people. So kudos for them to Alex. So integration testing involves combining


00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.320
individual units of code and testing them as a group, maybe kind of this type of testing aims


00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.600
to expose faults in interactions between integrated units. Yes, definitely. So basically you get to


00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.880
decide how much of the system you're going to put together. And, and if there's things that you want,


00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.240
don't want to include, that's kind of where this article comes in. It's it's challenging to do this,


00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.040
especially with web applications. So he goes through a lot of common things that you'd want


00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.800
to do, which is great. So he has a little, a little test app, which I think is pretty kind of,


00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.640
kind of fun. I don't know if he's includes the actual source code for the test app, but it's just


00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:29.600
the the, the, the, what the straight schema for the API that he's posting. So that's kind of cool.


00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.760
Anyway, talks about, okay, you're going to have to authenticate for almost all applications. So


00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.360
how do you, how do you mock that so that you can get around testing with that? So mocking authentication


00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.600
talks about that testing, the login page also talks about both testing. So one of the things


00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.880
that's kind of neat is he's using pytest, but he talks about how to do this straight in one test.


00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.080
And then also how to separate some of the mocking part into a fixture, because that's how you'd want


00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.880
to do it if you have multiple tests. And that's pretty cool. So mocking authentication talks about


00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.960
in, in the test client or within the test client here is, is his fixture and then


00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:17.120
directly in the tests. So kind of goes through a lot of detail with the authentication part,


00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.400
because it's the first time he's talking about mocking. Then also how about external APIs? So


00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.720
authentication is something you'd want to like put some mocking around so you can test that thoroughly.


00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.360
External APIs, definitely, because you don't really want to be hitting that a lot. And also


00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.000
you don't have control over what the external API is going to return. So you want to have more


00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.080
control over this. And so a couple examples here of actually, it was kind of, kind of really some


00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:49.520
pretty cool examples around mocking an external API and utilizes something I don't see very often


00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:55.520
is, oh, I don't know where it was. Oh, he, when he's creating a fixture for it, he's using


00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.640
indirect parameterization, which is, it's kind of a cool advanced pytest technique, but


00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:08.080
he explains it fairly clearly, and it's, it's pretty nice. So, oh, here it is. New, anyway,


00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.080
somewhere indirect, indirect. Yeah, I love seeing indirect because it's kind of a, it took me a while


00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.120
to get my head around indirect, but anyway, so, okay. So mocking authentication, mocking


00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.320
an external API, and then something else is you might want to mock the database,


00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:30.080
because you can possibly fill up your database with, you can, you can use a temporary database


00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:36.320
or a small one, but you might want to just mock it also. So talks about mocking MongoDB client


00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:43.760
or MongoDB database. So anyway, nice, nice discussion of testing a service specifically


00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.120
for FastAPI, but I kind of think this applies to everything, doesn't it?


00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:55.600
Yeah, I think so. So anyway, makes me think of VCR pi. Yeah. When you, if you're mocking out


00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.640
a call to external APIs, just record it, play it back. Like that one was good. I'll just do that.


00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:08.160
And on a lot of my integration tests, I just talk to MongoDB. Yeah, it's fine.


00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.960
So do you set up like an extra, an extra database and just fill it in?


00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.480
Yeah, because so much of our stuff, so much of the stuff that I have is, that the tests


00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.080
are addressing is like kind of static data. You know, it's like, oh, here's a list of podcasts


00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.720
or here's a list of courses. And it, it doesn't necessarily need to know, it doesn't need to


00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:35.760
depend on what those are. So yeah, anyway, yes, you have to rewind it. Tyler asks of VCR pi.


00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.400
You don't have to, but there is a fee if you take it back without, without rewinding.


00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.480
So yeah, be kind, rewind.


00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.640
Yeah, be kind. You kind of have to be a certain age to remember that. Remember that? Like,


00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.880
you're like, oh, I got this new movie and I got to rewind it. They didn't rewind it. You're like,


00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.760
oh, we're going to wait like two minutes to start watching this.


00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.840
Did you have one of those extra like fast, we had a, for a couple of years, we had a


00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.800
fast rewinder that you could just pop it in and it would just go.


00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:06.320
And I don't know what fast is, but I remember it would make quite the noise. So maybe it was fast.


00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.320
Yeah, anyway.


00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:16.000
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So Mojo Logic says blockbuster charges if you don't do it. That's true.


00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.280
Or your PRs don't get accepted if you don't rewind your tests. Either way.


00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.880
You know, let's talk about not getting accepted though, because oh boy.


00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.200
This is terrible.


00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.480
This is so bad. So this was recommended to us from Pat Decker previously on the show.


00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:36.720
And it's an article essay by Ruven Lerner, who like us teaches Python and teaches data science


00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:42.560
and stuff. And I will tell you the hardest part of our job is not writing courses,


00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:48.000
not coming up with courses. It's gaining awareness. It is so difficult to cut through


00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.920
all the noise. And even if you built something awesome for people to actually go, oh, maybe I'll


00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.440
pay attention to that for one minute to see if it is awesome. So we all have to try different ways.


00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:03.440
Some of us start podcasts. Others of us do different things. And Ruven said, hey, look,


00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:09.200
I'm just going to try to put in some meta, aka Facebook ads and see if I can get some


00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.640
interest from there. Right. Plenty of people are over there. So he does. And pretty soon,


00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:21.920
it turns out his ad count is canceled. He goes in there and says, you are banned for violating


00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:28.400
Facebook's policy on advertisement. He's like, I just don't know what I could have done wrong.


00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:35.200
It's so benign. I'm trying to sell corporate training to software developers for the most


00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:40.960
popular language by some standards in the world. I'm a reputable guy. I've been doing this for a


00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:48.560
while. It's not a shady business. No, banned. But there's a way to protest the ban. So he protests


00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.160
the ban. And they said, no, you're definitely banned. In fact, let's see if I can find it.


00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:58.640
Somewhere. It should be more bold in here, shouldn't it? Anyway, it says somewhere you're


00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:05.760
banned for life. Not only is your ad account temporarily banned, you will never, ever advertise


00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.520
on Facebook again. Okay. Why was that Brian? Because he was, they thought he was selling


00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:20.480
pandas and pythons, actual pandas and actual pythons. So, okay. So it's a misunderstanding,


00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.200
right? Let me give you all a glimpse into how big tech works. There's a misunderstanding.


00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.160
They have all these economy of scales. They have so many automated systems that even when you


00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:36.400
protest, it doesn't go to a human or when it goes to a human, it goes to a human who has a


00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:44.240
insanely fractional understanding of what advertising is or in examples that I've run into


00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:52.800
in the app store area. For like, when I first launched the Talk Python Training app for courses,


00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:59.360
it's been a week being declined at the Google play store because there's an app in the Google


00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:05.360
play store called learn Python. That's its title, learn Python. And mine is called talk Python


00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.160
courses or something along those lines in the Google play store. But in the description, it says


00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:16.160
if you get this app, you can learn Python from the experts at Talk Python Training and so on.


00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.040
Right. Yeah. Violated. You're trying to infringe upon the copyright of learn Python. That app


00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:27.600
already exists. Banned. Excuse me? Like, so I wrote back, surely you must misunderstand.


00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.360
I'm not trying to say the titles learn Python. It's just, it's an act that one takes one learns


00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.680
a subject and the subject happens to be Python. And so with our app, you can learn it. They're


00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:43.600
like band protests band. I'm like, what is going on here? And so finally I had to just change the


00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.000
subject. I said, okay, what if you were, we're learning a guitar, you want to learn music.


00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.280
And so with our app, you can learn the guitar. They're like, oh, I see the problem now. Yes,


00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.920
you're right. That's not the same thing as the title of learn guitar, the app, but it took a


00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:05.280
week back and forth. And this is exactly the same situation. I'm like, your one job is to like


00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.880
compare apps and see if they've like, you don't even understand the words that are in here.


00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.200
Right. And, but where do you go? Like I, I, protest as high as I could. And they're like,


00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.880
nope, band. I'm like, this doesn't even make any sense. And Reuven is in a, I would say slightly


00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.960
less bad because if you're banned from advertising, it's kind of like, well, I can't give this


00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.480
crummy company money and like to retarget. So it's not, it's not like you spent, you know,


00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.120
six months on an app and you can't sell it or deliver it, but still it's the same situation.


00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:41.280
Like the, the worst part is he's just put his head in the sand and said jerks for a while. And then


00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.640
came back like a year or two later and they have a data retention policy where they threw away all


00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:53.520
the data after 180 days. And so even though he has friends at Metta, they, nobody can help him


00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.600
because they threw away the data that would have proved he was selling Python courses,


00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.560
not Python animals. And so he's permanently banned. That's it.


00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.400
Really?


00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.960
Yes. Yeah. Because they, they, they won't do it. And it was like a bot that banned him.


00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.400
It's really, really frustrating how some of these things work because like, you know,


00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.200
an elementary school kid could go, yeah, I see those are not the same. These people whose job


00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.560
it is to make that distinction. Don't it's crazy. Yeah.


00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.600
Yeah. Well, I guess if I ever want to advertise on Facebook, I'm glad that there isn't an animal


00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.200
named by test. so yeah.


00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.680
Oh, well, and that you have a rocket, not some kind of animal. David out there points out,


00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.520
it's surprisingly crushing to have your app rejected. It really is. Cause you work for months


00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.600
on it and then you think, ah, it's ready to launch. And then it's just like, Nope, there's absolutely


00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.520
no path forward to even delivering it. It's not like a website you just put on and people can


00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.400
like it or not.


00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:55.520
Yeah. But I mean, also, I mean, Reuven it is his life cutting off advertising channel is,


00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.040
is pretty big deal.


00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.640
It is a pretty big deal. I think, you know, the more, the reason I brought this up is I think


00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:09.040
it shines a light onto just like big tech in general and how kind of, it strips the humanity


00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.440
out of a lot of these situations and the person is just, Nope. Well, you know, bot says, no, go


00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:20.560
away. Also a lot of these huge services and huge companies that like they're making tons of money


00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:26.080
and there's not really a way to talk to somebody, about it.


00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.720
Yeah. Think how important your, your Gmail is at, which connects to your Google docs and


00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.960
everything else and your photos. What if something goes wrong with your personal Gmail? There's


00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.480
no one to talk to. There's no recourse, right? It's just, well, all of your tax documents or


00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.520
whatever you happen to store wherever are good luck with that. Yeah. Or I mean, PayPal has been


00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.760
notorious about this too, of just like holding funds. Just, yeah. We're like, we're just holding


00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:55.600
it for 30 days. I, but I need it to like do there's no, there's nobody to talk to, but yeah.


00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:05.680
Sorry, Reuven. Sorry. Well, extras. I got a couple. do you, do you want to do yours or?


00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.560
Yeah, sure. I got my, yeah, sure. Mine, I almost made this an extra, extra, extra,


00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.160
extra episode because here all about it. Cause there's a lot of extras, but I'll, I'll, I'll


00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:22.640
go quickly. So first of all, I have spoken about McFly, which is an awesome new UI for state,


00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:28.560
like pretty much all the shelves on MacOS. I believe it's restricted to MacOS. Like it seems


00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:35.040
like a lot of these things are, but I love that. And so, Nick suggested that I check out


00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:43.120
Atuin, A T U I N making your shell magical with sync, search and backup of your shell history


00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.960
with end to end encryption, even so very, very cool. It's got a really nice UI with like a pop


00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:57.280
up that lets you search and navigate. it'll let you search through, like global, you know,


00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:02.800
all of the history or contextual based ones. Like what have I done in this directory before?


00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:08.960
Isn't that cool? It even stores whether the thing succeeded or not. So super, super cool. People can


00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:15.840
check this out. I believe it is, pretty cross platform. I don't think it's yeah, it's written


00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.440
Russ. I think it works at least, probably on Mac and Linux. This is actually created by


00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:29.360
Ellie Huxtable. So very nice job, Ellie and, props to her 701 Huskvar and a cool picture of


00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.600
her out riding somewhere. So anyway, yeah. If that sounds interesting, check


00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:41.280
Atuin or however you say it out. Pretty neat. Nice. let's see. JupyterCon 2023 had a ton


00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.600
of great talks. There's 86 videos with a surprisingly only 2,400 views across all 86


00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.960
videos, but we're trying to change that. People should check it out. So all those sessions from


00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:59.280
JupyterCon 2023 are out and I'll link to those. And there's many things like, look at that second


00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:06.960
one there. Shelley has a JupyterHub pytest plugin. Nice. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Neat. And then I'm going


00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:12.560
to make sure I give credit for this one. Hemu sent in something. This is all, this is the episode on


00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.720
shells. So it's an interesting thing about, Hey, I talked about warp, right? where warp is


00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.320
really awesome because it lets you treat what you type as a, as an editor. So like I could type


00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.920
something, then double click part of it. It'll select it. I could just start typing and use my


00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.280
mouse, all sorts of things. So, you know, you can do kind of, sort of a little bit, half of that,


00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:41.040
um, with Zia Z shell and bash. So if you set it up, right, you can basically get, you already


00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.360
mentioned this, Brian, the Vim key bindings, but you can also set up like Emacs key bindings,


00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:51.200
I believe as well on and send over technically directions for this. But I don't know, man,


00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:56.320
when I look at these things, they're just so, the man pages and stuff, I don't know,


00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.720
they bounce off my brain. Like I just, I look at this. I'm like, just an example, anyone example,


00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.000
anyone anywhere in here, like, could you just give me an example of what I need to do to make this


00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.320
work? But no, it's just like this parameter affects it in this way. I'm like, great. But


00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.520
what is the one thing I need to just, so I get that, you know, anyway. And, did you know


00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:19.360
the Z shell is hosted on source forge of, Ooh, okay. Makes me a little less happy to use Z shell,


00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.120
honestly, just from a, or not. It's, it's been around a while and there's no churn in it.


00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.120
Yeah, I know. That's true. It's the default Mac is probably sufficiently safe, but yeah, anyway,


00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.520
those, thank you Timo for sending those in people can check them out if they don't want to


00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.320
deviate from where they are. All right. Carrying on. It was a rough weekend, Brian.


00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.440
Okay. It was a rough weekend. no, it kind of was like, I had a little bit of a cold. Then I


00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:51.440
got both the COVID vaccine and the flu vaccine all at once. And so then I was like three times sick,


00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:57.120
but it was also rough in the sense that a really cool feature for the rough or matter came out,


00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:03.840
AKA rough black, which is, cool. So that was a, I think some, major version was released.


00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.520
Skylar who originally told us about this, sending a message like, Hey, there's kind of a major


00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:14.080
release. And the one thing that was holding me back from using it was, I was, I talked to


00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.560
Charlie Martian and he said, Hey, we're already working on this, but I'm like, Hey, I much prefer


00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.200
using a single quote instead of double quotes. It's like, help us understand why. So one of


00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.760
the main reasons is like, I have RSI stuff that I got to be careful about. I'm fine. As long as I'm


00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.080
careful. But if I'm not, then I'm not. Yeah. So for example, if I wanted to type the letter a,


00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:37.440
as a character, I use double quotes. It's five keystrokes. If I use single quotes, it's three


00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.680
keystrokes. Right. And it's also, you know, fewer hands in action, just like less wear and


00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:49.200
tear. So I'm like, really don't want to switch double quotes like black does. So for a rough


00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:55.440
for matter added, somewhere, I maybe don't have any, I have it in the show notes you have,


00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.160
you just say, format dot quotes, I equal single. And then instead of going to double


00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.320
quotes, it goes to single quotes, but it also has some exceptions for like doc strings and


00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.680
things like that. So pretty cool. So the other sense in which it was a rough weekend is I


00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:16.000
blasted, all the, the podcast websites and the training website with rough dash, rough format


00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.240
and formatted like 600 Python files with it. And it took it like a champ and just like rough itself.


00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:28.000
It's so fast. You go format these 600 or these, I guess one project, probably the biggest one had


00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.720
350 format, these 350 Python files. It done. It didn't work. What did it do? And it literally


00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.600
just goes straight away. It's awesome. Nice. Yeah. It's super fast. Yeah. Super fast. And


00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:46.320
okay. So, glyph says, Hey, thanks for the quick Mac hockey shout out last week. And more


00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.800
importantly, my video for that whole talk, which featured that, but like six or seven other cool


00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.680
things that you should check out is now online. So I'll link it to the video for him there. Nice.


00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.120
That was a good one. All right. That's it. Other than Joe, what are your extras?


00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:04.880
Okay. Well, I got a couple, Ned batch elder, wrote a post, said, where did everybody go?


00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:11.200
Um, so basically kinda, you know, post Twitter, where are people and the, and you know, we've


00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.120
covered this before. I'm like, I've tried new things lately. one of the things he talks about


00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:23.120
is a blue sky and I've tried that. I would say I'm not going to try threads because it's because


00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.800
of where it comes from. But, I tried blue sky and it's just seems to be empty to me. there's,


00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:34.320
it's slowly gaining traction. But one of the things that I, why I bring this up is one of the


00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:40.560
commenters said, Oh, by the way, remember that sir, text search now works on master on. And I


00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.520
kinda didn't know about that. So I wanted to make sure that people knew that. and we could play


00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.560
with it here. Oh. And I also wanted to show off a picture of my cats. So this was, this was my


00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:56.640
bad cat yesterday getting into things. But so if you go up and just do search, we can, we can


00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.240
just search for stuff now and it, and it doesn't, it's more than just the people you follow. So


00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:08.000
that's pretty nice. Yeah. That originally was, protect people that might go use the search


00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.680
to find people or groups they want to like jump on and start yelling at. So if you can't search


00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.320
for them, you can't find them. You can't be mean to them, but it really did take away. I'm like,


00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.840
I just, who was talking about this thing? I have no way of knowing. Right. And so I probably


00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:29.040
positive. I certainly useful. Yeah. It's useful. It's useful for me to have search. and Hey,


00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:35.040
look at that. high charm and JetBrains are doing a webinar about testing on November 21st.


00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:41.280
That that's cool. I'll definitely have to check that out. so, and the other thing I wanted


00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.840
to bring up is I released, I'm still working on the, the complete PI test course, which is not


00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:51.680
quite complete yet. but chapter nine was released, last week, over the weekend


00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:57.600
and chapter nine covered, covered coverage. And, my, my use of, coverage has changed


00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:04.240
over the past year or so. So, I kind of reflect that the video is well, way updated version of how


00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.600
I use coverage than when I wrote the book. So that's nice. Awesome. Those are my extra rats.


00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.440
Glad you're making progress there. That's excellent. Thanks. Before we get to the joke,


00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.400
um, two things, two comments from blaze. I used to work at the Google apps team when it was started.


00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.200
The goal was to have zero personal interaction, which I can understand that, but it sure leaves


00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.720
you in a lurch when the automation doesn't treat you well. Right. And add to an user for the past


00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:36.480
year. Pretty cool. Like me, no idea how to pronounce it. Jeremy says Python REPL also uses,


00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:43.200
uh, realign. So anything bash edit can do too. So now I have Vim and my Python REPL,


00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.160
which is kind of cool. Okay. Yeah. All right. Ready for a joke? Yeah. Do it. Let's do it. All


00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:54.080
right. So this one is visual, but just imagine a normal, normal distribution. Okay. And the


00:32:54.080 --> 00:33:00.720
height is representing code complexity. And can I open this? Yes. And the X, what would be the X


00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:06.960
axis is representing years or time of programming. Okay. So right in the beginning, when you're


00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:13.200
brand new, you write super simple code, right? I'm just getting started. I got some for loops


00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:18.080
of function maybe. And then as you get a little experience, it goes up in complexity. It got


00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:23.280
object oriented programming everywhere, a little farther design patterns, baby at the peak of the


00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:28.000
normal distribution, you've got abstract interfaces. I might need this later. And this


00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.920
is what the experts do. But, but as time goes on, you go right back down that slope after like 10


00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.720
years of programming, you're back to like super simple code. It's honestly, this really connects


00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:47.360
with me as a kind of a lesson. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I had, a couple of years ago, I had


00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:53.120
some people at the company asked me to, to develop a template that people could use to write their


00:33:53.120 --> 00:34:01.200
test code. So I had a test with one function in it called the def test underscore, and it said,


00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.840
assert true. That was it. I'm like, okay, here's your template. you don't really need much.


00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:12.320
Yeah. And also the OOP everywhere. I mean, I remember doing tons of classes now,


00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:18.400
even with my C++ code, I tried to avoid as many classes as I can. yeah.


00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.840
Cause it just gets in the way. This totally looks like my life. Yeah.


00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.080
Yeah. Mine too. I think classes are fine, but like deep object


00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.320
hierarchies and trying to make object hierarchies to find the whole world is a pretty bad adventure.


00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.400
Although the worst I do think is that I might need this later. So let's build an abstraction


00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:39.920
around this concept rather than I'll just refactor it if I actually do. And Pat, Hey,


00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.440
Pat is out in the audience says less is more. Thank you. Indeed, Pat.


00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:49.760
I'm a big fan of the term yagony that came up with the extreme programming. You ain't gonna need it.


00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:57.200
You ain't gonna need it. So keep it simple. Something stupid. Indeed. Anyway. Well,


00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:03.600
thanks. Yeah. And I'll try to put this picture as the chapter art for this chapter. So glance


00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.720
down at your podcast player and you might see it. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Even works in CarPlay. I don't


00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:14.320
know about Android auto. Haven't both listened to CarPlay. One of our, one of our episodes on


00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:20.160
Android with Android auto turned on, but I know it works for, for iOS. Okay. Don't look at your


00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:26.160
phone when you're driving though. It's true. It's true. All right. See you later, Brian.


00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.680
Thank you everyone. Bye.
