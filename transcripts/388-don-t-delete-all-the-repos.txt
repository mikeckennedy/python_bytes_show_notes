00:00:00 Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05 This is episode 388, recorded June 18th, 2024.

00:00:11 I am Michael Kennedy.

00:00:12 And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:13 And this episode is brought to you by Scout APM.

00:00:16 Check them out.

00:00:17 We'll tell you more about them as we get further into the show.

00:00:20 Brian, you, me, the podcast, we're all Fosstodonians and folks who want to come hang out on Mastodon.

00:00:27 Doesn't have to be Fostadon.

00:00:28 Talked about that last week.

00:00:30 That's the whole idea of Fostadon.

00:00:32 Go wherever you want, but we're happy to invite you to Fostadon if you want.

00:00:35 Yeah, find the links to connect us over there or even on X these days as well if you wish.

00:00:42 A lot of people are still just hanging out over there.

00:00:44 And listen, watch, participate live in AM Pacific Time on Tuesdays, typically.

00:00:51 Links in the show notes or on the website.

00:00:54 Finally, if you want a handcrafted, artisanal Brian Okken special summary and set of links of whatever we talk about, even if you don't listen to that episode, pythonbytes.fm.

00:01:05 Click on the newsletter.

00:01:06 Put in your information.

00:01:07 We won't share it.

00:01:09 Just want to tell you about what we're up to and keep in touch with you.

00:01:11 So that's pretty awesome.

00:01:12 That list keeps growing and people are enjoying it.

00:01:14 So good work on that, Brian.

00:01:16 There is a newsletter link.

00:01:17 That's cool.

00:01:18 Yeah.

00:01:18 How about that?

00:01:19 Nice.

00:01:20 We also kind of put it under the Friends of the Show thing, but that's a little more indirect, you know?

00:01:25 Like, okay, you want to sign up for the newsletter?

00:01:27 Click the newsletter button.

00:01:28 You can sign up for the newsletter even if you don't like us.

00:01:31 That's fine.

00:01:32 Yeah, that's true.

00:01:33 Yeah, you can just mock the links we put in there everywhere.

00:01:36 It's pretty much like that.

00:01:37 The show, too.

00:01:38 Everyone's welcome.

00:01:38 There probably are, actually.

00:01:41 All right.

00:01:43 Well, what have you brought today?

00:01:45 All right.

00:01:46 I want to talk about the PSF election.

00:01:49 So the Python Software Foundation has elections every year.

00:01:51 In order to vote, we're going to talk about a little bit around what's going on with this.

00:01:56 But I want to highlight that you, even if you voted last year, you can't just vote again without doing something.

00:02:03 And it's not difficult.

00:02:04 You just have to affirm your membership status.

00:02:06 So we've got a link in the show notes.

00:02:09 You just head up.

00:02:11 We'll talk about the dates a little bit.

00:02:12 I think maybe the dates are here.

00:02:14 No, there's another link.

00:02:16 We have lots of links for you for this.

00:02:18 But there is the, what are we doing?

00:02:21 What are we voting on?

00:02:23 We're voting on the new board of directors.

00:02:25 And then there's a few bylaws changes.

00:02:28 So head over to the first link.

00:02:30 Make sure you're either signed up.

00:02:32 So the deadlines are right around the corner.

00:02:34 So it's 25th.

00:02:35 June 25th is when you have to either sign up to be a member or, if you already are, affirm that you're going to vote.

00:02:44 So that's the 25th.

00:02:46 The board election, if you go to the board election, there's a blog post called, it's time to make nominations for the PSF board election.

00:02:56 It has the timeline.

00:02:57 This is a great, it's got mostly all that I'm talking about here.

00:03:01 Their nominations are open.

00:03:04 They opened on the 11th.

00:03:05 If you'd like to be nominated or nominate somebody, that is up until the 25th of June.

00:03:11 So the 25th of June is the close of board nominations.

00:03:14 It's also the cutoff date to affirm that you're going to vote or eligible to vote or whatever.

00:03:19 So that's June 25th.

00:03:21 Then we don't know who's in it because the candidate, it's still open.

00:03:25 Other people might enter.

00:03:27 And there's link, there's information in here on like what to include because you'll want some information about like who you are and stuff like that.

00:03:35 If you want to nominate yourself.

00:03:37 So the candidates are announced June 27th.

00:03:42 And then voting starts, voting is from July 2nd to July 16th.

00:03:49 So voting's in July, but we need to get everything ready in the end of June.

00:03:53 So that's what's going on here.

00:03:54 So there's, it's the nominations for the board of directors.

00:03:58 And there's links about what's going on.

00:04:02 Oh, there's, there's one other data I wanted to highlight.

00:04:04 Can't remember where I found this, but there is a, here it is.

00:04:09 Thinking about running for the board of directors, let's talk.

00:04:13 There is a June 18th session that you can, office hours where you can find out more information.

00:04:19 If you, if you're just curious and you'd like to know more, that's a great place to go.

00:04:24 There is, and then, so it's for the board of directors.

00:04:28 And then there's, there's also three bylaw changes proposed.

00:04:35 I think they make sense, but I'm not going to get into the depths of them, but there's a link here.

00:04:41 Go ahead and check that out about the, the three things.

00:04:44 So one of the things that I'm really kind of excited about is this.

00:04:47 The first one is merging, contributing and managing member classes.

00:04:52 And I think that's, I think it makes sense because I sometimes have forgot which is which,

00:04:57 what contributing and managing means.

00:05:00 And it, I think there's, there's, there's text on all of these.

00:05:04 So go ahead.

00:05:05 And then there's discussions going on around this too.

00:05:08 So anyway, elections coming up, make sure that you've affirmed your voter status.

00:05:13 If you'd like to vote.

00:05:14 So.

00:05:14 Okay.

00:05:15 Interesting.

00:05:16 Some of these shed some light on messages I've seen on social media.

00:05:20 What are, why are people talking about this?

00:05:22 Oh, okay.

00:05:22 I see.

00:05:23 Propose changes.

00:05:24 Got it.

00:05:24 Yeah.

00:05:27 So you know what I would propose, Brian?

00:05:29 What?

00:05:30 If you were working for a company and you were having HR issues, let's say, what would you

00:05:37 say exactly you do here?

00:05:39 Bob?

00:05:39 No.

00:05:41 You're having HR issues.

00:05:42 I'm a people person.

00:05:44 I talk to the people.

00:05:45 Then you just can't talk to the people.

00:05:46 No.

00:05:47 Yeah.

00:05:47 Something like that.

00:05:48 But anyway, if you were having issues with work and you got fired and you wanted to give

00:05:53 them the big middle finger on the way out.

00:05:55 One thing I don't recommend is going to all the GitHub repositories and permanently deleting

00:06:00 them or deleting the logs or then replacing them with code that mocks the existing employees

00:06:06 or anything like that.

00:06:07 There's this character and boys, he seemed like a piece of work.

00:06:12 Let me tell you.

00:06:12 Mick Lewis, Daniel Brody, a real, real piece of work.

00:06:16 Cloud, cloud engineer.

00:06:17 I don't know what a cloud engineer is.

00:06:18 I don't know what software developers are.

00:06:20 I know what.

00:06:20 Anyway, he's a cloud engineer.

00:06:22 He was sentenced to two years in prison and a restitution of over half a million dollars

00:06:28 for wiping the code repositories of his former employer in retaliation to being fired from

00:06:34 First Republic Bank.

00:06:35 Wow.

00:06:36 Wow.

00:06:37 So probably some kind of discrimination thing or something.

00:06:42 He really had a reason to be upset.

00:06:43 No.

00:06:44 Why was this guy fired?

00:06:45 The court documents state that Brody's employment was terminated after he violated company policies

00:06:50 by connecting a USB drive containing pornography to the company computers.

00:06:55 And then when they tried to get the work computer back.

00:06:58 You know, after he's done all this stuff to it, like deleted all the things and so on.

00:07:03 He then reported the laptop stolen.

00:07:06 Wouldn't give it back.

00:07:08 Huh.

00:07:08 Anyway, he may be not having a great time.

00:07:12 A couple of things he did.

00:07:14 He ran a malicious script named dar.sh to wipe the FRB servers, deleted Git logs, and Git commit history for that particular script.

00:07:23 You know, props to him for a little covering of the tracks there with the Git history.

00:07:26 That was clever.

00:07:28 I don't know how they figured that out, given that he-

00:07:30 Not too clever.

00:07:31 Nah, exactly.

00:07:33 Exactly.

00:07:34 I mean, you delete the repo and you still get that figured out somehow.

00:07:36 Anyway.

00:07:37 He accessed the GitHub repositories and deleted hosted code.

00:07:41 He inserted taunts in the code.

00:07:45 Yeah.

00:07:45 Anyway, I just thought this was, one, an amusing story.

00:07:48 A little bit of schadenfreude.

00:07:50 But also, people, if you're upset with your company, it is not worth it.

00:07:54 Two years of prison, half a million dollars.

00:07:56 Just walk away.

00:07:58 Just walk.

00:07:59 Just let it be.

00:08:00 It's not worth the revenge.

00:08:01 Anyway, let me leave you with that, huh, Brian?

00:08:03 What do you think of this?

00:08:04 Is this crazy?

00:08:05 I think it is, but I also, one of the things I really, okay, I'm not like taking sides here or anything, but something that drives me nuts is a thing that some companies do that say that, like, there's standard non-disclosure agreements for exit interviews.

00:08:22 And some of them are generally, you can't talk about what you worked on at this company for, say, like a period of six months or a year or something like that.

00:08:31 Just because you might have proprietary information.

00:08:34 The thing that drives me nuts is things that say, we're not going to give you any of your severance or a portion of your severance unless you promise to not ever disparage the company forever in the future.

00:08:49 Things like that are just insidious and like a blight on free speech.

00:08:55 It's disgusting.

00:08:56 Yeah.

00:08:57 I don't like it.

00:08:58 I know it's a standard practice, but I don't like it.

00:09:00 I don't like it either.

00:09:02 I am really happy to hear the non-compete stuff getting shot down.

00:09:06 I know it's not the same as NDA, but it's in the same category, I feel like.

00:09:09 Do they do that for people getting fired?

00:09:12 No, no, no, not for, but, you know, when you get hired, there's traditionally been a lot of non-competes.

00:09:20 And I think it was getting kind of out of control, like bakery workers or something silly like that, right?

00:09:25 You know, like really, really stuff that you wouldn't think would be under that purview.

00:09:30 But I believe that that got federally shot down or is it just California?

00:09:34 I can't remember.

00:09:35 But yeah, anyway, maybe this kind of stuff you're talking about, Bill, as well.

00:09:38 But I don't have a ton of sympathy for this character.

00:09:41 Yeah.

00:09:42 Reminds me a little bit of the guy who took down all the JavaScript folks with the NPM left pad.

00:09:50 Yeah.

00:09:51 And then later was arrested for making bombs.

00:09:53 You know, it's like, oh, there's that theme here, I see.

00:09:54 Yeah, not good.

00:09:57 Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the same person.

00:09:58 There's definitely a person with the same name in the same area.

00:10:00 Okay.

00:10:01 Hey.

00:10:01 You know what is awesome and is not going to get you into trouble?

00:10:04 Scout APM.

00:10:06 Let's talk about it.

00:10:06 So if you are tired of spending hours trying to find the root cause of issues impacting your performance,

00:10:12 then you owe it to yourself to check out Scout APM.

00:10:15 They're a leading Python application performance monitoring tool, APM, that helps you identify and solve performance abnormalities faster and easier.

00:10:25 Scout APM ties bottlenecks such as memory leaks, slow database queries, background jobs,

00:10:30 and the dreaded N plus one queries that you can end up if you do lazy loading in your ORM.

00:10:36 And then you say, oh, no, why is it so slow?

00:10:38 Why are you doing 200 database queries for what should be one?

00:10:40 So you can find out things like that.

00:10:42 And it links it back directly to source code.

00:10:44 So you can spend less time in the debugger and healing logs and just finding the problems and moving on.

00:10:49 And you'll love it because it's built for developers by developers.

00:10:52 It makes it easy to get set up.

00:10:54 Seriously, you can do it in less than four minutes.

00:10:56 So that's awesome.

00:10:58 And the best part is the pricing is straightforward.

00:11:00 You only pay for the data that you use with no hidden overage fees or per seat pricing.

00:11:06 And I just learned this, Brian.

00:11:08 They also have, they provide the pro version for free to all open source projects.

00:11:13 So if you're an open source maintainer and you want to have Scout APM for that project,

00:11:18 just shoot them a message or something on their pricing page about that.

00:11:21 So you can start your free trial and get instant insights today.

00:11:25 Visit pythonbytes.fm/scout.

00:11:27 The link is in your podcast player show notes as well.

00:11:30 And please use that link.

00:11:31 Don't just search for them because otherwise they don't think you came from us.

00:11:35 And then they'd stop supporting the show.

00:11:37 So please use our link pythonbytes.fm/scout.

00:11:39 Check them out.

00:11:40 It really supports the show.

00:11:42 Indeed.

00:11:43 Brian, what's your second one?

00:11:45 I'd like to talk about imports right now.

00:11:49 So if we're just importing a package.

00:11:53 Is this like tariffs and stuff?

00:11:54 What are we talking?

00:11:54 No, no, no.

00:11:55 Importing code into your own code.

00:11:57 So imports are normally difficult.

00:11:59 You just say import and the package name you want to import.

00:12:02 No, no, no.

00:12:03 The package has to be installed already or a standard library thing, of course, like import

00:12:07 or math or something.

00:12:10 I'm blanking right now.

00:12:11 It's terrible.

00:12:14 There is a blog post called Adam Johnson, which is talking about like, what if you don't

00:12:21 want to just use the import?

00:12:22 If you want to import it as an object or something.

00:12:23 And let's say you have a string to describe the package that you want to import.

00:12:28 There's a thing that I didn't know about called the packageutil.resolve name.

00:12:34 And this is actually pretty cool.

00:12:37 So what you do is it's in packageutil is part of the standard library.

00:12:42 And you say packageutil.resolve name.

00:12:44 And then you give it a string.

00:12:45 And it's got it's like it's like a package name that is also something that's installed

00:12:51 or in something in it, like a top level item, like the example is path lib and capital

00:12:57 path, the path object.

00:12:59 But I tried it on one of my own projects of just like, let's say I've got some third party

00:13:04 code that I want to import just something from it.

00:13:07 But I don't want to import it into the namespace.

00:13:08 I want to just import one thing out of there into an object.

00:13:12 And this is really cool.

00:13:13 The whole thing resolves and it's from a string.

00:13:15 So you give it a string with this colon in the middle and it creates it.

00:13:21 It creates you've got an object.

00:13:23 Why is this helpful?

00:13:25 Well, I don't know how other people are using it, but I'm using it for things like testing

00:13:31 and stuff that I don't want to like clutter the entire namespace.

00:13:33 I just want one object from something.

00:13:35 So so there's that.

00:13:36 Now, there's a note here that says the thing that you're you're importing.

00:13:40 Importing can be it can be a class from the package or a function or module or really any

00:13:46 top level thing object within the package.

00:13:50 You can just resolve that and bring it in.

00:13:52 If you're doing if you're going to grab the whole module, you can also use import lib import

00:13:57 module, of course, you can use that as well to import a thing.

00:14:01 And it's a little bit different syntax.

00:14:03 You just give it the give it the name of the package.

00:14:05 So there was a note at the top that says Django and some other frameworks allow you to do things

00:14:13 like this to configure something based on a string.

00:14:15 And I think this is pretty cool.

00:14:18 I'm one of the places where I'm considering.

00:14:20 Yeah.

00:14:21 Anyway, I've got lots of places and tests that I'm considering using this.

00:14:24 But but I guess I didn't know about it.

00:14:27 It's pretty neat.

00:14:27 So, you know, one area that might be useful that comes to mind outside of testing or in

00:14:31 addition to testing would be some kind of like plug in extension system.

00:14:35 So you say any any package that gets listed in this JSON file, we want it to be available.

00:14:42 And if you configure the app, it'll actually import it and use it.

00:14:44 But it might not import them.

00:14:46 The app doesn't know about them.

00:14:47 That can't be coded into it.

00:14:48 So you could just sort of parse that thing, pry it or, you know, even scan all the packages

00:14:53 somehow and see if they exist or whatever.

00:14:56 Right.

00:14:56 So some sort of dynamic thing like that as well.

00:14:59 Yeah.

00:14:59 Yeah.

00:15:00 Pulling dock strings out of a bunch of stuff to do a list of that.

00:15:04 Yeah.

00:15:05 Nice.

00:15:06 Lots of stuff you could do.

00:15:07 And you sure could.

00:15:08 Now, this last item from me here comes from Alex.

00:15:11 Monaghan just gave us a shout out and said, you know, that DuckDB thing, right?

00:15:17 DuckDB is a little bit like SQLite-ish type stuff and in process based on files rather than

00:15:24 separate servers, all those sort of things.

00:15:26 Well, that thing's getting some traction, up to 4 million downloads a month off of PyPI.

00:15:31 But the news is it's released version 1.0 of DuckDB.

00:15:37 And by the way, the cloud-hosted product, Mother Duck, also opened up general availability.

00:15:42 But the news is the announcing a 1.0.0.

00:15:47 And interesting, there's a lot of conversations like, well, we could have just called it 1.0

00:15:51 as soon as we made it public on GitHub, you know, 10 years ago or whatever it was, or not

00:15:56 quite 10 years ago, 8 years ago.

00:15:57 But focus is really on we want to make it super clear.

00:16:02 They want to make it super clear that they're focused on stability.

00:16:05 What's here is kind of what's going to stay.

00:16:08 So examples that they give, you know, as that thing has evolved, as DuckDB has evolved, they've

00:16:14 changed the file format around.

00:16:16 And that's created incompatibilities from different versions.

00:16:19 And so, for example, they're now committing to more stable back and forth

00:16:25 stability on the file system and things like that.

00:16:28 So very cool.

00:16:29 If you're looking for an interesting SQL-like database to include into your projects, this

00:16:36 one, you know, is quite popular.

00:16:38 20,000 stars.

00:16:40 A really analytical and process database rather than relational database focused, right?

00:16:46 You can do cool stuff like integrate it with pandas and other things like that, which is

00:16:51 pretty cool.

00:16:51 Yeah.

00:16:51 Like, for example, select star from a parquet file or a CSV file and so on.

00:16:55 So not meant to replace SQLite, but that's kind of the mental model people should have.

00:17:00 But more on data science.

00:17:03 Select star from a CSV file.

00:17:04 That sounds fun.

00:17:05 Anyway.

00:17:06 And by the way, this guy, Alex, Alex Monahan is in the audience.

00:17:10 Here's a backwards compatibility for the files.

00:17:12 So you can just leave those files around and not have to like manage the upgrades of them

00:17:17 and so on, which is especially tricky if they're just local files associated with an app rather

00:17:22 than a single server that all the apps talk to where you can just manage that one thing,

00:17:26 you know, through an API.

00:17:27 Yeah.

00:17:27 Pretty cool.

00:17:28 Cool.

00:17:29 All right.

00:17:29 Thanks for sending that in, Alex.

00:17:31 And good job, DuckDB folks.

00:17:33 Brian, what else you got?

00:17:34 I've got a couple extras.

00:17:36 Let's hear.

00:17:37 One of the extras that I wanted to talk about was just like, I guess, a shout out to everybody

00:17:43 that sends us topics.

00:17:45 I really appreciate it.

00:17:46 We appreciate hearing what's new.

00:17:48 Don't assume that we've heard about it just because we do pay attention to a lot of stuff,

00:17:52 but there's a lot to pay attention to.

00:17:54 So if you think it's important, let us know.

00:17:56 Yeah, Brian, I would say a lot of times people start messages like, I'm sure you've heard

00:18:00 of this.

00:18:01 And we're like, I have no idea what this is.

00:18:02 No.

00:18:03 I'm sure we have not heard of this.

00:18:05 I'm sure we have not covered it either.

00:18:06 But also it helps if like three or four people send in to say, this is exciting, then that

00:18:12 also helps us know that it is exciting.

00:18:15 Yeah.

00:18:15 It's pretty much guaranteed to be in on the show.

00:18:17 You can send it in anytime.

00:18:19 But the one request is if it's timely and it really needs to go in this week, if it

00:18:25 shows up at all, try to send it before Tuesday because, you know, sometimes we already have

00:18:30 our topics anyway.

00:18:32 That's right.

00:18:32 Yes.

00:18:33 So right after Tuesday, a Wednesday is a fantastic day for recommendations.

00:18:36 Really, anytime is great for me.

00:18:41 But anyway, so a couple new 2.0 releases I just wanted to shout out.

00:18:46 We talked about this last week, but NumPy 2.0 is out now.

00:18:50 So NumPy 2.0.

00:18:51 So and there's a scientific on the scientific Python blog.

00:18:55 There's a discussion about it.

00:18:58 So you can read up on all the NumPy 2.0.

00:19:00 And this is kind of exciting.

00:19:02 I just heard about this yesterday.

00:19:03 HTMX 2.0.

00:19:05 I don't.

00:19:05 Oh, you have my attention.

00:19:07 So I haven't read any of this, but it should be so there's major changes and we'll see.

00:19:14 I'm not sure what broke or what.

00:19:16 Wait a minute.

00:19:17 Why the 2.0?

00:19:18 But I'm not sure I can switch to this.

00:19:20 This release ends the support for Internet Explorer.

00:19:22 Oh, my gosh.

00:19:23 Just kidding.

00:19:25 The interesting bit about this, though, is they're not marking 2.0 as the latest on NPM until January of 2025 because they'd like to have everybody, you know, have a smooth transition to there.

00:19:39 So anyway, any extras on your side?

00:19:42 A few.

00:19:43 First of all, partnered with the folks over at PyCharm.

00:19:46 And now if you are taking a course at Talk Python Training, you can get six months of PyCharm Pro for free.

00:19:53 That even works for our free courses.

00:19:55 So if you just come over and take a course, sign up and check that out.

00:19:58 Only works for new accounts at JetBrains.

00:20:01 It doesn't work for renewals.

00:20:02 So this is the best I can do, folks.

00:20:05 But it's still pretty awesome to be able to get a good chunk of the users free access to PyCharm Pro.

00:20:11 Also, other item is we have a awesome new course on data science coming to Talk Python.

00:20:17 Its release is imminent.

00:20:18 It awaits a marketing landing page, basically.

00:20:21 And then it's out.

00:20:22 So we have a new course called Reactive Web Dashboards with Shiny.

00:20:28 Shiny for Python, not Shiny for R.

00:20:30 So partnered with Posit folks to put this course together.

00:20:34 And it's super cool to build interactive dashboards and web apps for your data science things with Shiny.

00:20:41 Shiny, of course.

00:20:42 Very cool.

00:20:44 Indeed.

00:20:44 It's a Shiny brand new course.

00:20:46 All right.

00:20:46 It will be Shiny for a while.

00:20:49 How about a joke?

00:20:51 Are you up for it?

00:20:51 Yes.

00:20:52 Okay.

00:20:53 So we all, you know, you're sitting around, you're in a relationship.

00:20:55 You have these thoughts that just kind of run through your head and you always don't know.

00:20:59 So here's a young couple laying in bed.

00:21:01 The woman is thinking, I bet he's thinking about another woman.

00:21:04 That guy is just laying there.

00:21:05 What would happen if I add a gitignore into the gitignore file?

00:21:09 She's like, she's giving him way too much credit.

00:21:12 What would happen?

00:21:14 I know the title is I Can't Ignore the gitignore.

00:21:17 What would happen if I add the gitignore to the gitignore file?

00:21:20 No.

00:21:22 Well, there's the joke.

00:21:28 This is what I got for you, Brian, this week.

00:21:30 I don't know what to tell you.

00:21:32 Now I've got to try it to see.

00:21:33 Exactly.

00:21:34 I don't know.

00:21:35 If you do that, you might take GitHub down.

00:21:37 I wouldn't, I don't know if I'd check that in.

00:21:39 Well, not GitHub, but local.

00:21:41 Well, I mean, it has automation.

00:21:42 It could explode.

00:21:44 It could.

00:21:44 Dependabot will just stop working for everyone after that.

00:21:47 Yeah.

00:21:48 All right.

00:21:49 All right.

00:21:49 Well, that's it.

00:21:51 Well, everyone, thank you for listening.

00:21:54 Scout APM, thank you for supporting the show.

00:21:56 And Brian, thanks as always.
