00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.620
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.160
This is episode 421, recorded February 24th.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.320
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.400
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.500
And this fabulous episode is sponsored by all of you folks that support us at,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.180
like maybe taking a course over at Talk Python Training or heading to pythontest.com,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.340
learn about pytest, maybe taking a course.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.760
We also love our Patreon supporters, so thank you.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.760
If you'd like to connect with us, of course, you can check.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:40.600
There's six links in the show notes for the show and me and Michael over at Blue Sky or Fostadon or Mastodon.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.440
So keep in track of both of those.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.740
And if you'd ever like to jump into the show live, you can head to pythonbytes.fm/live

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:56.720
and check out when the next recording will be and you can be with us and ask questions and stuff.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.180
And it's fun.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.060
And finally, the newsletter is still going out.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.760
And Michael's made some improvements to it.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.820
So we're making some neat things.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.060
And I think it's a really cool resource now.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.940
If you're, especially if sometimes you listen to the show and you're like,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.320
that seems like a cool topic, but I don't quite know much about that thing that they're talking about.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.500
We're including some background information.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.060
So if you'd like to learn more about the topic, we're including a lot of links and that's really cool.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.400
Yeah.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.880
Super fun.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.300
Yeah.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.260
Speaking of super fun, what's your first topic for us, Michael?

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.340
You know what is super fun?

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.520
Debugging is super fun.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.880
Because testing is sometimes fun, but debugging, that's where the mysteries really live.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.760
You never know.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.000
And if you don't do much testing, you might do more debugging.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.540
You never know.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.680
Anyway, I want to talk about debugging HTTP calls.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.880
Now, one way in which you might do this is you might say, I have this well-factored piece of code over here.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.620
And I can call this function and we can, in isolation, test how it talks to some part, something else in the world.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.000
Right.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.320
And maybe we'll mock the HTTP later out.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.820
We talked about REST, RSPX, which was a cool way to mock out HTTPX.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.760
And, you know, there's VCR and other things like that, which you might do.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.240
But this kind of allows you to intercept what's actually happening.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.600
You could use it during tests or you could use it just when your app is running.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.080
All the HTTP calls coming out of your Python app and then gives you a UI for understanding them.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.300
Pretty darn cool, I think.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.840
Yeah.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.320
Okay.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.100
So what you do is the thing is called HTTP DBG for debug because those two vowels are hard work, folks.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.800
And so HTTP debug tool is for Python developers to easily debug HTTP or HTTPS client requests in a Python program.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.680
All you got to do to use it is instead of saying Python, my app, you say, hi, HTTP debug, my app.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.520
And it will sort of wrap and mock out all of the stuff.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.420
Mock is maybe not quite the right word because it still does the action.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.420
sort of put an adapter or an intercepting layer on top of all your behaviors, right?

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.960
Okay.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.560
So you get, yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.280
So you get this UI and it shows you all the requests that your app has made.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.520
And then you can click on them.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.860
You can put them side by side and compare them.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.940
All those kinds of stuff.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.860
Which for the grand total effort of pip install and then run your code slightly differently.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.400
But it's, you know, that's a lot of benefit and a lot of visibility into your app.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.680
So if you're doing things like maybe using Postman or something like that to kind of test out the calls and you try to replicate it over there and you're like, why is it not
quite the same?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.840
Well, you put this thing on it and see what happens.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.340
Yeah, I can also see this like as a learning tool while you're just learning how all of this stuff gets put together.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.000
Like, how does the request get, what does the data look like and what's going on here?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.900
Yeah.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.640
It's pretty neat.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.920
Absolutely.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.160
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:03.800
And the other thing you can do is it's not just your direct HTTP calls, like say HTTPX or requests or something.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:12.080
If something else, a library you're using is then calling the API and it's not your library, you still get visibility into what that thing's doing.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.500
Because it's anything the application does, not anything that your code does, which is pretty cool.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.660
So if you're using, say, the Sentry API and you're like, why is it failing to talk to this thing?

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.720
Like, what is it even doing?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.340
You know, you just say capture exception.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.580
But, you know, somewhere along the way, HTTP request is being done.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.660
So you could intercept that as well, like all the traffic.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.360
And I guess if you're like, is my thing spying on me?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.840
Is this library that I'm using reaching out to something that I'm not aware of that's happening?

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.940
You could also catch that theoretically.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:50.160
But it supports requests, URL, HTTPX, my fave these days, AIO HTTP, PIP, pytest, UnitTest, and your package.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.400
Yes, if you include it.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.960
Anyway, there's, then when you run it, you get a web interface that gives you some behaviors in the UI.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.160
You can change the strategy to group requests.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.040
You can hide the scheme, the network URL.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.780
You can group rows, tags, all these different things.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.920
So there you have it, folks.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.520
HTTP.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.860
I think you're supposed to just say the initials like HTTP.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.460
This is hard.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.960
HTTP.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.360
DBG.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.460
Yeah, that's.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.020
Yeah, possibly.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.900
Anyway.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.280
Okay.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.240
Something a little easier to pronounce.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.760
PyPI now supports iOS and Android wheels for mobile Python development.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.380
This is cool, I think.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.500
This is very cool.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.720
Yeah.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.360
This is very cool.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.260
So this is brought to us by Sarah Gooding.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.840
And so the announcement really is there's been some work.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:50.060
Russell Keith McGee has been a longtime advocate to try to push this ball forward and get Python directly on devices better.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:58.860
So there's a couple of PEPs, 730 and 738, to talk about adding iOS and Android as a supported platform.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.540
So now they are their wheels supported there.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.700
So how do we take advantage of this?

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.480
Well, there are some information in the article that we're linking to.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.080
But also, let's see.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.240
There is, there's some tools that I've heard of Beware and we've covered Beware and Kivi before.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.340
And then Chakopi, Chakopi, maybe?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.720
I don't think, I don't know if we've covered that.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.220
But that's another one for Android.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.660
Yeah, that sounds new to me as well.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.640
I haven't, I don't remember that one.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.380
So, however, so you're going to either use these.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.940
But I was curious about like, so for pure Python stuff, if I want to be able, like, if I'm not doing anything too fancy,

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.800
and I want to be able to have it be installable on one of these, what would I could possibly do?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:53.560
And CI Build Wheel is one of the tools that people have used before for other operating systems.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.420
And apparently that's not ready yet, but that is in the works.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:03.980
So CI Build Wheel updates are in progress to simplify iOS and Android wheel creation.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:13.000
So soon, more and more third-party little libraries might be in, possibly big libraries might be available for.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.660
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.880
I'm very excited for this.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:22.340
I think this is, you know, there's two areas of Python that are very troublesome, right?

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.280
If someone comes to you and says, hey, I want to do some programming.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.080
What language should I use?

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.340
Python, that's a great one.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:27.740
Yeah.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.660
So I'm looking to build a mobile app like this.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.420
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.640
I totally retract my statement.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.000
You can't even, don't do that.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.660
It's the one.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.980
And then the other is like Vue, React, other front-end JavaScript-y things, right?

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:45.900
And what's cool is that the folks at Anaconda are actually really working hard to address both of those.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.720
And part of what we're seeing here is some of the work from them.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.940
I actually had, bumping over this way, I had Russell Keith McGee on, the guy behind Beware,

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:02.060
to talk about the state of Python on mobile just, YouTube helped me out, five days ago.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.520
Wow.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.600
To talk about this.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.640
And he's been working, employed by Anaconda, as part of their open source team for a couple

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.120
years, solving these problems.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:18.300
Getting him and a guy named Malcolm are getting peps to have Python officially be, to have iOS

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.900
and Android an official build target of CPython, which is pretty interesting, right?

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.180
Yeah.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:28.440
We expect, as part of the core developer process, we should be able to build it so that it runs

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.700
on those platforms.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.940
And those peps, I believe, are accepted, but not necessarily in yet.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.260
So that's upstream in a lot of the work that Russell has done.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.400
And they're using CI Build Will to make this happen.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.800
So a lot of interesting stuff happening there.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.280
Yeah.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:43.680
Yeah.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.080
Cool.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.540
Yeah.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.140
I wasn't planning to talk about that episode, but since you brought it up, it sounds like

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.480
if you guys are like, wait, what, what is all this about?

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.180
You know, listen, I don't know that much, but Russell gives us the whole rundown last week.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.880
So you can check that out.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.060
Can't wait to listen.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.000
Yeah, definitely.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.780
Should be out soon.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.180
Okay.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.500
No joke.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.900
How about a game, though?

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.440
Yeah.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.360
I like games.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.460
I'm ready for the joke.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:04.960
But the game.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.160
So we got a notification from, I can't remember.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.500
Oh, yes.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:19.820
Mayak Simering, who's working on Arcade, the game platform, and it hasn't had any major updates

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.280
for a while until now.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.700
They just released 3.0 of Arcade.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:30.180
So if you are a huge fan of Mario Brothers type of 2D scrolling games, or you want to build

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.680
something like Asteroid, you know, the game from the 70s, that kind of UI, well, this

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.760
is a really great platform for it.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.860
So what are the changes?

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.820
Breaking changes.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.560
But, you know, I guess that's expected after a while.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.980
Drop Python 3.8.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.940
Seems fine after, you know, the world has moved on from there.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.480
But texture management completely changed.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.440
And they used to cache everything.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.580
Apparently it was too much.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.560
But now you can reload and probably things are fast enough that you don't need caching.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.780
It works better.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.260
Like, keep working memory.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.840
In the graphics card or something better.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.220
Remove some stuff.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.880
Fixed Arcade context and so on.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.980
But, you know, mostly, I want to put this out there as if you've been thinking of building,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.660
like a 2D game type of thing.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.520
And you're like, well, Arcade's interesting, but it hasn't gotten a lot of love.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.840
Well, now it has, right?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.220
Last update yesterday.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:17.860
Pretty cool.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.980
You know, actually.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.140
If you want an example, there's some examples.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:20.480
Sorry, Brian.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.740
There's some examples you can link to off of the Arcade Academy website.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.540
Go ahead.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.520
No, I just, you said it hasn't had a lot of love in a long time, but it's still been,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.840
I mean, I don't know if they needed to fix some things to get it to work on modern Python.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.340
Okay.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.760
Yeah, I'm not sure if they, I don't know that they necessarily did, but it just hasn't had

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.080
any major releases, you know?

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:44.620
Well, I'm noticing, so I've been doing that top pytest plugin thing and investigating a

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.380
lot of the plugins.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:50.400
And there's a lot of stuff, I'm noticing there's a lot of stuff that used to be updated a lot.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:57.460
And for, just to say, like in the trove classifiers to say, I support, you know, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.120
And then they just sort of stop.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:07.000
But a lot of, I guess, try stuff out because Python has been pretty stable for a lot of

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.340
things.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.920
And it's been, even though we've gotten some really cool things, it's still very backwards

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.400
compatible.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:19.820
So there's a lot of old packages that don't say that they work on modern Python, like 3.13

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.980
or something, but still do.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.780
So don't dismiss a package just because it hasn't been updated for a while.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.500
Try it out.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.280
It might be fine.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.600
So that's good advice.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:34.740
There's one thing where I can't remember if it, was it Rust or some other platform, their

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:40.580
equivalent of PyPI was they were automatically putting security warnings or something like

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.620
that onto packages that had not had a Git commit in two years.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.460
But, you know, it might be done.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.580
There's a thing that could just completely do what it's supposed to do and not need to

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.520
change anyway.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:51.740
Yeah.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.120
Yeah.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.960
So you can check out the different kinds of games.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.580
I got some, a bunch of example games that you can play.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.040
And try on.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.160
They look, they look pretty cool.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.140
Like if you're looking for a, I don't want to use Unreal Engine and go completely down the

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.240
higher team of a hundred people to build a game.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:05.580
Yeah.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.000
That's the fun.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.120
That looks pretty cool.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.180
It does look pretty cool.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:08.620
Yeah.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:08.940
Yeah.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.120
And I think it's, I think it's OpenGL based.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.940
Pretty sure.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.640
Is that right?

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.160
Yeah.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.180
Yeah.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.500
It's built on top of Piglet and OpenGL.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.100
Yeah.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.760
So use your graphics card for all sorts of fun stuff.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.740
Yeah.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.540
Yeah.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.180
I guess I'm, I'm on tangent mode right now.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.280
I guess I was thinking about games and a lot of people think, I think a lot of kids get

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.760
into like want to get into programming because they think game programming would be fun and

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.260
game programming is hard.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.900
And I mean, there's a lot of programming that's hard, but, but big game programming, there's

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.120
a lot of stuff going on.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.340
And, and it doesn't necessarily, I just don't get frustrated if you start game programming

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.840
and it, it, it's a little difficult and that's, there's a lot of programming that's pretty, pretty

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.240
straightforward.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.060
Yeah.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.920
So yeah, I totally agree.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:58.720
I, I did some of my first programming was 3d simulators in OpenGL and it was not the easiest

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720
thing ever in C++.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.460
Yeah.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.600
Nice.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.660
Okay.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:10.540
Well, other things to not do, is don't, okay.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.620
I'm, I think I'm going to have too many negatives here.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:21.120
Um, I just, I guess one to announce that PEP 765 has been accepted and PEP 765 is to disallow

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.680
return, break, and continue, that exit a finally block.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.340
That's a lot of terms.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.480
So what am I saying?

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.080
Um, it's that there's the keywords return, break, and continue shouldn't show up.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.420
In a finally block.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.260
And, when I first saw this, I'm like, why would I do that anyway?

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:44.540
I, I just don't, I usually put pretty simple stuff in finalies and I wouldn't ever think

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:50.140
to do a, I might think to do a return or anyway, that the, the, the, it's just bad.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.420
And the behavior apparently is surprising.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.680
So, so they really would hope to not have that in there.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.640
So apparently this was rejected once before, but now it's accepted slightly different.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.940
There's a, the, I guess there's some, cost benefit analysis of the change that was

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.960
done and it will be better for everybody if we do this.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:17.180
However, because of some backwards compatibility stuff, it will not be a syntax error.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.820
It will be a syntax warning.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:27.180
So I guess, we'll, we'll rely on, people running with dash W a or having rougher

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.000
like eight or pilot or something.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.720
Check this stuff for us, but basically don't, don't do it.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.740
Just don't.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.680
So it's not good.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.220
Not good.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:35.580
Yeah.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.160
I can sure.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:36.580
I can sure.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.320
I can sure see return in it.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:37.640
Finally.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.380
That makes a lot of sense to me.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.340
I, it's a little, I'm not sure why return is pulled out, but like break and continue

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.320
and other looping.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.300
And I can see why that's all right, but yeah.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:47.740
Yeah.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.220
Whatever.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.760
I mean, it's not hard to work around.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.240
Just that.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:52.420
Yeah.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.580
So this isn't a big topic.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.420
Just, just to be aware if you're doing something fancy within your finally blocks,

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.480
pay attention to this.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.000
Stop.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.620
Stop.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.000
Stop.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.020
Stop.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.400
Apparently.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:01.900
Yeah.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.660
All right.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.080
Well, we're going to stop with our items, aren't we?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:04.900
Yeah, we are.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.680
We got some extras.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.880
We sure do.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.740
So exciting.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.620
Let me fire some up.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.380
So remember our teapot episode for 18.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.020
I'm a teapot.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:19.300
Well, we had our joke about the teapot and, I think the person who created the joke that

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.720
we covered felt that he didn't get enough love or something like that.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.320
Cause we pulled up a post somebody had on Mastodon, Mastodon, Blue Sky, Blue Sky, I think that

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.420
said, Hey, funny joke.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.420
Person shared it.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.640
Well, Nikita says important correction.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.720
Uh, we, I think it's, I, I created this joke.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.500
So anyway, thank you, Nikita for, creating this joke.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.180
It was very funny.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.140
So I'll, I'll link to that to give him a little bit of credit.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.360
Next up, Brian.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.140
Oh, it's just like a slightly different name.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.880
So Nikita reported it.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.820
It was a joke by Nikki Tonsky, a different person.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.660
Oh, different.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.220
Okay.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:54.740
All right.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.040
Perfect.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.140
Well, thanks for the correction.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.560
So I have something really surprising.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.960
So check this out.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.740
I had a Mac mini M1, the very, very first.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.960
Apple Silicon Mac that came out, the Mac mini.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.920
I got it in 2020.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.940
And I remember, I think we talked about this at the time in 2020.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.580
I'd already ordered the new MacBook pro, which was still the Intel.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.160
Then I saw the Apple Silicon stuff come out and I actually canceled it and like reordered

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.620
the mini.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.460
And it was best decision ever.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:26.180
Well, good decision and worked out great, but it's just been chilling around here.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.080
I've had my Mac mini M2 pro that's all maxed out and it's been laying around at that.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.060
You know, I'm not doing a lot with the other one, but I wanted to set it up so I could do

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:34.860
easier recording.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.580
And I'm like, starting to get a little slow, but you know what?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.100
I'll just, I'll just live with it.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.380
I don't really need to buy a new mini.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.120
Like I don't need to waste the money just for that.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.360
And then for some reason I start, I saw the, that Apple started having refurbished ones that

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:47.860
you could buy.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.240
And it turns out to not be a very good deal.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.960
It's like, Hey, the refurbished one's like 579.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.240
The new one's 599.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.640
And I go, wait, I'll just take the new one.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.800
I looked at what would my old 2020 Mac mini trade in for?

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:06.300
Well, first of all, how much is a new Mac mini with the M4 10 core, 10, pretty much the same

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.820
specs except for the hard drive.

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.220
Oh, and it's the brand new way, way faster computer.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.060
599, 600 bucks us.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:12.660
Wow.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.360
My old mini from five years ago traded in for 425.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.180
What?

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.140
So I got a brand new Mac mini M4 for $175.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.340
I want to point out anyone else before any of this stuff changes, you might also want to get a new

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.900
mini for $175.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.360
If you have a five-year-old one, how awesome is that?

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:32.840
Yeah.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.860
I think mine's only a couple of years.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.320
I should check it out, but it might be worth checking out.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.140
And I ran it through geek bench here.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:47.320
And even against my M2 pro, which is way faster than my old mini, it is this new one that was $175,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:53.240
a lot faster than even the M2 pro single core is like 40% faster.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.500
Even multi-core is something like 20% faster for that little bit of money.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.900
So, hey, that's just putting it on the radar.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.020
Y'all might want to check that out.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.840
That's a pretty good trade, in my opinion.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.460
Nice.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.580
All right.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.900
That's all for my extras.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.980
But yeah, I just thought that that was a really surprising thing.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.200
I'm like, you know, all right.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.360
Okay.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.260
I'll do the trade.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.440
I'll trade the mini.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.240
A couple extras.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.880
Also, I just really love using the mini to record with because it's always silent.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.180
It's always silent.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:24.940
And it's...

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.220
Yeah.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.560
And they're pretty cheap, even go big.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.280
So I just went for a bottom-end one.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.340
I think I spent $400 on this or something.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.640
Ridiculous.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.640
Well, you probably can trade it and get one for like another $20.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.640
Yeah, maybe.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:42.680
So I have mentioned before that I'm not a fan of Scheme and Lisp.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:50.020
And I guess I just want to hit a nerve for at least one person.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:50.880
Philip.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.560
And I'm sorry, Philip.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.300
I'm not going to try to pronounce your last name.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.120
But it looks cool.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:55.860
Lisiak?

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.500
Something like that?

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.340
Okay.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.400
Lisiak?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.160
Nice.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.400
I'll probably mess it up, but we'll see.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.760
Okay.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.940
But he decided to...

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.500
And we interacted on the...

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.980
I think Fosstodon or Blue Sky or something.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.560
And just kind of...

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.840
He said, you know, basically, what do you got against it?

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.240
I'm like, I don't have anything against Scheme, really.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.900
I just...

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.160
Personally, me, I didn't find a lot of use for it.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:21.960
And we talked about it.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.600
And I actually wrote up this big conversation with him that I need to make into a blog post.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.440
Because I do appreciate that I learned Scheme.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.900
I just haven't used it a lot.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.860
So...

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.820
And he said, there's a lot of uses.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.100
And I said, I'd love to hear some.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.300
And he's like, oh, okay.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.000
Well, then I'm going to have to write a blog post.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.740
So he wrote My Land of Scheme in 2025.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:49.240
So we're going to link to a blog post of all the cool stuff that Scheme does lately.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.900
At least from his perspective.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.860
So that's cool.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.860
And then...

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.500
Actually, I really enjoy his writing style.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.020
So I really like good long-form blog posts.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.560
But anyway, good writing style.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.120
Thanks, Philip.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.760
And he also just recently released another article,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.300
Exposing Flaky Tests with pytest Rerun Failures.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.580
And it's a plugin that I've used a lot too.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.180
So cool writing.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.060
So keep up the blogs, people.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:16.720
Like it.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:22.600
And I'm really sorry if I have offended anybody that likes Scheme or...

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.800
Or what else?

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.720
Who else can I offend?

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.480
Pearl writers?

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:27.940
C-sharp.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.020
C-sharp.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.360
I just don't enjoy writing C-sharp in Scheme.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.800
It isn't anything against the language.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.920
It's just not for me.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.120
So anyway.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:35.820
All right.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.560
Well, I can see why it's tough, Brian.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.760
I can see why it's tough.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.680
I actually pulled this joke up when I thought of...

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.800
I can see why it's tough.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.440
And I thought of you when I said...

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.580
So, question.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.320
This is like you being too logical or you may be a tester.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.640
When I was four, my sister was two.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.860
I'm now 44.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.180
How old is my sister?

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:54.960
Programmer.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.340
Easy.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.240
44 minus four, but minus two from that.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:58.840
And all that.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.080
That's two years difference in the gap.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.960
So, 42.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.640
Tester.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.500
Well, you see.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.740
This is a tough one.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.380
She might be 42, but she could be 41 or 43 also.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.300
Since you didn't say when your birthday is and her birthday is.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.400
Also, she could be dead.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.800
Finally, I thought she was your sister.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.560
You might have thought she was your sister, but actually your mom had an affair with another

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.220
man and a woman who was one.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.480
And it turns out it's not your sister.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.440
So, with that...

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.080
You know, and on and on it goes.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.240
Give it away your real sister.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.260
You don't know how old she is.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.880
Finally, what if you think your sister is dead, but she actually has become an astronaut on

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.160
a secret government project and she's been traveling at near light speed.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.660
Now, her time is going much more slowly.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.040
She could actually be younger than 41.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.760
You see, it's hard to be a tester, right?

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.000
Yeah, I like it.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.480
I like Anthony's answer.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.680
Two is half of four.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.320
So, if...

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.400
Oh, my God.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:53.940
Hey, Anthony.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:54.980
Shout out in the audience there.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.940
You are absolutely right.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.320
And if you go to the YouTube comments, it's...

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.200
Duh.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.120
She's 22.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.280
Then it says...

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.140
Someone else says, a fellow McDonald's graduate, I see.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.440
Yeah, that was an easy one.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.820
Oh, follow up.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.500
That's a chat GTP answer.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.860
Chat GPT answer.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.140
Last time she was half your age.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.400
Oh, my gosh.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:16.740
Okay.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.240
Oh, and nice inside joke there.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.720
Anthony making fun of AI since he's pretty much an AI pimp these days, as far as I remember.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.200
But anyway.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.000
Anyway, the comments are pretty funny as well.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.140
And then someone just responds green.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:36.680
Green.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.040
Awesome.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.320
Awesome.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.860
Well, it's great to have people in the audience to chat with and be part of the show.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.540
And, Brian, great to be here with you, right?

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.720
It's good to be with you.
