00:00:00 <v Brian Okken>Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05 <v Brian Okken>This is episode 453, recorded October 16th, 2025.

00:00:10 <v Brian Okken>And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:11 <v Brian Okken>And I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:13 <v Brian Okken>This episode is sponsored by us.

00:00:15 <v Brian Okken>Check out Talk Python training.

00:00:17 <v Brian Okken>Check out the complete pytest course and other stuff over it.

00:00:21 <v Brian Okken>So we've got talkpython.fm and Pythontest.com is where you want to head.

00:00:26 <v Brian Okken>And also, we want to thank our Patreon supporters because, yes, this episode is sponsored by us, but we don't really pay ourselves.

00:00:34 <v Brian Okken>You guys do.

00:00:35 <v Brian Okken>And the Patreon people do throw a few bucks our way.

00:00:38 <v Brian Okken>And we really appreciate that.

00:00:40 <v Brian Okken>So thanks.

00:00:41 <v Brian Okken>Also, love getting tips and extra topics and stuff sent our way.

00:00:46 <v Brian Okken>It doesn't matter whether we've heard it or not.

00:00:49 <v Brian Okken>It's okay to just send it.

00:00:51 <v Brian Okken>If you think it might be worth talking about on the show, send it our way.

00:00:55 <v Brian Okken>and you can connect with us on Bluesky and Mastodon and all of the places.

00:01:00 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, more often than not, Brian, people say, <v Brian Okken>I'm sure you've heard of and we haven't heard of.

00:01:04 <v Brian Okken>We haven't heard of it yet.

00:01:08 <v Brian Okken>Because unlike you guys, we don't have a good news podcast

00:01:12 <v Brian Okken>around Python to listen to.

00:01:14 <v Brian Okken>Exactly.

00:01:15 <v Brian Okken>If you'd like to be a part of the show or watch past recordings,

00:01:19 <v Brian Okken>head on over to pythonbytes.fm/live, <v Brian Okken>and you can be part of our audience.

00:01:24 <v Brian Okken>uh we've done a couple that today's a thursday at 10 sort of a day um and various reasons but

00:01:31 <v Brian Okken>usually it's monday at 10 we'll let you know if that ever changes but you don't have to

00:01:35 <v Brian Okken>just memorize that because um at python by set of m slash live it'll tell you when the next one is

00:01:41 <v Brian Okken>and uh speaking of next ones we should talk about something interesting michael what do you got for

00:01:46 <v Michael Kennedy>yes um you know we've got pypi and just for new folks out there not pi pi not pi not pi pi uh

00:01:54 <v Michael Kennedy>That's happening less.

00:01:55 <v Michael Kennedy>People used to say, I installed it from PyPy a lot, <v Michael Kennedy>and that's not so much the thing.

00:02:00 <v Michael Kennedy>But the next one, IPI++, well, 1+, <v Speaker 3>it's not quite a C++++.

00:02:07 <v Brian Okken>Do you wish that Python had++ instead of plus equals 1?

00:02:11 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't really increment that much, actually.

00:02:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay, your numbers just stay the same.

00:02:16 <v Michael Kennedy>That's fine.

00:02:16 <v Brian Okken>Well, I mean, in C++, we increment it all the time <v Brian Okken>because that's how you do for loops.

00:02:21 <v Brian Okken>True.

00:02:22 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's a good point, actually.

00:02:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, you shouldn't be doing that in a for loop.

00:02:25 <v Brian Okken>No.

00:02:25 <v Michael Kennedy>No.

00:02:26 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:02:26 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't miss it that much.

00:02:28 <v Michael Kennedy>But, you know, plus plus used to be sort of the next thing.

00:02:30 <v Michael Kennedy>So I want to talk about this thing called PyPI plus the next one.

00:02:36 <v Michael Kennedy>So this is just a different UI on top of PyPI search with some extra information.

00:02:41 <v Michael Kennedy>And I ran across this and I don't know where I saw it, but it's really neat.

00:02:46 <v Michael Kennedy>I really like it.

00:02:47 <v Michael Kennedy>It's discover all the packages with interactive pendency visualization.

00:02:52 <v Michael Kennedy>So you can come in here and you can put in something like content types.

00:02:56 <v Michael Kennedy>I talked about that recently.

00:02:57 <v Michael Kennedy>This is a little library I have that given a file to tell you what like web

00:03:01 <v Michael Kennedy>content type or MIME type it needs to be and vice versa.

00:03:04 <v Michael Kennedy>As the little thing says, and you click on it and it says, well, what is it?

00:03:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Look, it shows you the author, the version, the license, the size,

00:03:12 <v Michael Kennedy>how many things pinned upon it.

00:03:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Look at this.

00:03:14 <v Michael Kennedy>So you can expand the section to see where it is and it's spinning and

00:03:19 <v Michael Kennedy>spinning and I don't know what it's looking for.

00:03:21 <v Michael Kennedy>But this dependence, I believe that means there's another package out there on PyPI that depends on my package.

00:03:28 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:03:28 <v Michael Kennedy>Which is kind of cool.

00:03:29 <v Michael Kennedy>You can also bump through the different releases and show you who is dependent upon these releases even.

00:03:35 <v Michael Kennedy>It gives you a score.

00:03:37 <v Michael Kennedy>Come over here, a health score of your project.

00:03:38 <v Michael Kennedy>So this is something people ask about a lot or want to know about a lot.

00:03:41 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, how do I decide if a library that I'm looking at or that Michael or Brian recommended is a good thing or a bad thing?

00:03:48 <v Michael Kennedy>I mean, obviously malware is something you should consider and supply chain attacks,

00:03:52 <v Michael Kennedy>but just is it well-maintained?

00:03:54 <v Michael Kennedy>Is it a good choice to build upon, right?

00:03:57 <v Michael Kennedy>And so this has a rating, and apparently my content type thing is 93 out of 100,

00:04:02 <v Michael Kennedy>and it's getting dinged for mostly because it's pretty new.

00:04:06 <v Michael Kennedy>It's not that old.

00:04:07 <v Michael Kennedy>It's only got five releases, and I think I created it beginning of the year or something like that.

00:04:11 <v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:04:12 <v Michael Kennedy>And it also has no documentation.

00:04:14 <v Michael Kennedy>I mean, it has documentation in the readme, <v Michael Kennedy>but it doesn't have a read the docs documentation

00:04:18 <v Michael Kennedy>separate from what it just says in the readme.

00:04:20 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:04:20 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:04:21 <v Michael Kennedy>And so that's bringing down its score, <v Michael Kennedy>but it still has got an A, which is 93 out of 100.

00:04:25 <v Michael Kennedy>That's pretty good.

00:04:26 <v Michael Kennedy>What do you think of this thing?

00:04:27 <v Brian Okken>Actually, I was poking around on it on my own.

00:04:31 <v Brian Okken>Search for pytestCheck.

00:04:33 <v Brian Okken>Because one of the things, I've got more dependence on mine.

00:04:37 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:04:37 <v Brian Okken>And, well, you can do, I'll just, I can pop it up also.

00:04:43 <v Brian Okken>I got it.

00:04:43 <v Brian Okken>Buy, desk, check.

00:04:44 <v Michael Kennedy>One of the things you can do is this the first one.

00:04:47 <v Michael Kennedy>I got an A.

00:04:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Yay, 96%.

00:04:49 <v Brian Okken>Yay, 96%.

00:04:50 <v Michael Kennedy>You probably have documentation.

00:04:51 <v Michael Kennedy>No, you don't.

00:04:54 <v Michael Kennedy>What?

00:04:55 <v Michael Kennedy>But it's also, like me, it has, well, you've got a lot more dependence, right?

00:05:02 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, one of the things I think is kind of neat, the dependence is fun.

00:05:05 <v Brian Okken>I didn't really know how to look for that before.

00:05:08 <v Brian Okken>There's probably a way.

00:05:09 <v Brian Okken>But rating the dependencies also, <v Brian Okken>because there are dependencies,

00:05:15 <v Brian Okken>the things that you're bringing in have a score also, <v Brian Okken>and you can look at what their score is,

00:05:22 <v Brian Okken>and you can just traverse down the dependency tree.

00:05:28 <v Brian Okken>And that's kind of cool.

00:05:29 <v Michael Kennedy>I think that's great.

00:05:30 <v Michael Kennedy>I think actually your score should somewhat include the score of your dependents,

00:05:34 <v Michael Kennedy>things you depend upon.

00:05:35 <v Michael Kennedy>Maybe.

00:05:36 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:05:37 <v Michael Kennedy>Right?

00:05:37 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, if I have an A++ score, but I depend on a thing that's got an F, well, how stable is my thing, you know?

00:05:44 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, and also, it's interesting that you can go by version, too, because, yeah, sometimes you add or remove dependencies with versions, too.

00:05:52 <v Brian Okken>So it's kind of, there's a lot of stuff going on here.

00:05:55 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, it's kind of fun.

00:05:56 <v Michael Kennedy>Absolutely.

00:05:57 <v Michael Kennedy>This is really neat.

00:05:59 <v Michael Kennedy>I recommend people check it out.

00:06:00 <v Michael Kennedy>I think I'm going to use this for exploring packages.

00:06:03 <v Michael Kennedy>I generally just default to GitHub.

00:06:05 <v Michael Kennedy>I'll go to PyPI to see if it's there.

00:06:07 <v Michael Kennedy>And then I'm like, okay, just get me to GitHub <v Michael Kennedy>so I can get a real view of this thing.

00:06:10 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:06:11 <v Speaker 3>But I actually like this quite a bit.

00:06:13 <v Michael Kennedy>And so I might start using this as kind of a default way.

00:06:17 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what you can do is you see how it's got the URL

00:06:19 <v Michael Kennedy>is just PyPI plus slash project slash project name.

00:06:23 <v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:06:24 <v Michael Kennedy>You can set up a custom search, not shebang, <v Michael Kennedy>but a custom search keyword in your browser.

00:06:30 <v Michael Kennedy>So I could type like P plus space and then search.

00:06:35 <v Michael Kennedy>whatever I put into my URL address bar would just pull up this page searching for whatever you put.

00:06:40 <v Michael Kennedy>So you could make it basically a built-in search engine to your browser.

00:06:44 <v Michael Kennedy>So I might do that, actually.

00:06:45 <v Michael Kennedy>I haven't done it yet.

00:06:46 <v Brian Okken>Or just go up and change the URL to whatever package name you want.

00:06:50 <v Michael Kennedy>I know, but then you've got to go to the place.

00:06:52 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm talking when you just have an open tab, right?

00:06:54 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, I'm just in my browser.

00:06:55 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, I want to search.

00:06:56 <v Michael Kennedy>Does this exist on PyPI?

00:06:58 <v Michael Kennedy>So right now I type PyPI space and then some package name,

00:07:00 <v Michael Kennedy>and then it will pull me up to the search results on PyPI.

00:07:03 <v Brian Okken>Oh, you're hardcore.

00:07:04 <v Brian Okken>- Oh, poor, okay.

00:07:05 <v Michael Kennedy>- You could do that here, right?

00:07:06 <v Michael Kennedy>You could just say Pi Plus or whatever.

00:07:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, I really like it.

00:07:10 <v Michael Kennedy>I would like to, what's weird about this, <v Michael Kennedy>there's something weird about this,

00:07:14 <v Michael Kennedy>in that it has no attribution.

00:07:15 <v Michael Kennedy>No, I can't tell who's behind it.

00:07:18 <v Speaker 3>I can't tell if there's a GitHub project.

00:07:21 <v Michael Kennedy>It literally is unknown.

00:07:23 <v Michael Kennedy>What the heck, there's no contact desk, <v Michael Kennedy>there's no built by, it's a little weird

00:07:27 <v Michael Kennedy>that it's like secretive like that, and I don't know why.

00:07:29 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't think it's dangerous because you don't install

00:07:32 <v Michael Kennedy>from here and you know it's just like a front end on top of existing data but

00:07:36 <v Michael Kennedy>they're just like weird bugs like for example what would I write if I was

00:07:39 <v Michael Kennedy>writing Python I'd write import not py test - check I write py test underscore

00:07:44 <v Brian Okken>check yeah yeah yeah well that doesn't exist if I search even though they're

00:07:49 <v Michael Kennedy>equivalent so I have like one package called Jinja partials which is awesome

00:07:54 <v Michael Kennedy>I love this one and it's Jinja underscore partials it is 95 by the way

00:07:58 <v Michael Kennedy>Hooray. But if I put a Jinja dash partials, nope, doesn't exist. Couldn't see that. There's

00:08:04 <v Michael Kennedy>no package called that. And vice versa. I have a FastAPI chameleon that does have the dash,

00:08:10 <v Michael Kennedy>but the Python thing is underscore. So there's just like a little bit of weirdness like this.

00:08:14 <v Michael Kennedy>And I would love to go, hey, whoever built this, I want to use this thing. It's cool.

00:08:17 <v Michael Kennedy>But incredibly simple normalization on your search results would be so good.

00:08:23 <v Brian Okken>Yeah. So it looks like PyPI does do that.

00:08:27 <v Brian Okken>Like the search for both.

00:08:30 <v Michael Kennedy>So PyPI, Jinja, partials.

00:08:34 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. And if I put the dash, yeah, it pulls up both.

00:08:37 <v Michael Kennedy>Right. It's, yeah, exactly.

00:08:39 <v Michael Kennedy>So cool.

00:08:40 <v Michael Kennedy>Exactly. So it should here.

00:08:41 <v Michael Kennedy>But other than that, this thing is quite neat.

00:08:43 <v Michael Kennedy>So a fun place to play in Explorer packages.

00:08:47 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:08:48 <v Michael Kennedy>I think we're both covering some alpha things here <v Brian Okken>because I'm going to talk about a couple more alpha things.

00:08:55 <v Speaker 3>First off, well, I don't know if it's alpha.

00:08:57 <v Brian Okken>A project called uv-ship.

00:08:59 <v Brian Okken>Yep, it's zero-verse, so I'm going to call it alpha.

00:09:02 <v Brian Okken>But I kind of think it's sort of fun.

00:09:05 <v Brian Okken>So I've got to, because of the, what, the update to 3.14,

00:09:11 <v Brian Okken>I want to make sure that all my projects, <v Brian Okken>definitely all the ones I support,

00:09:15 <v Brian Okken>even the ones that I think I'm the only one using them, <v Brian Okken>I'd like to update stuff.

00:09:19 <v Brian Okken>And I also, I've realized that I have like three shipping pipelines that I'm using.

00:09:25 <v Brian Okken>Like I've changed how I published Pipe PI over the years.

00:09:28 <v Brian Okken>And I kind of want to go back to just one version.

00:09:31 <v Brian Okken>And I like just being able to, I know there's a lot of opinions around this,

00:09:37 <v Brian Okken>but I like to be able to make sure everything's pretty good and then push a version number

00:09:42 <v Brian Okken>and then do a remember whether I do a version first <v Brian Okken>and then create a release on GitHub.

00:09:50 <v Brian Okken>And those two things kind of have to happen.

00:09:52 <v Brian Okken>And one of those can trigger the published IPI.

00:09:55 <v Brian Okken>And I'm kind of going back and forth <v Brian Okken>as to which one should trigger that.

00:09:59 <v Brian Okken>But anyway, there's a pushing of a version <v Brian Okken>that has to happen.

00:10:03 <v Brian Okken>This uv-ship tool is based on uv, <v Brian Okken>but it does a lot of this stuff.

00:10:08 <v Brian Okken>It like, what does it do?

00:10:10 <v Brian Okken>It says it said it verifies the repo state.

00:10:12 <v Brian Okken>So make sure that you don't have anything checked out because you should be at the point not checking out and that you're on the right release branch because there's a there's some configuration you have to set up.

00:10:22 <v Brian Okken>But it's it's the defaults are fine.

00:10:25 <v Brian Okken>Verifies the repo state bumps your project metadata.

00:10:28 <v Brian Okken>So bumps your version number and refresh.

00:10:32 <v Brian Okken>You can you can have it update the change log and it even like pops up a dialogue that says you should go manually edit this right now.

00:10:39 <v Brian Okken>And then it commits, tags, pushes, and all that stuff.

00:10:44 <v Brian Okken>And each step of the way, it reviews.

00:10:46 <v Brian Okken>So I've done the, it has a dry run mode that it talks about.

00:10:51 <v Brian Okken>So you can uv tool install it so that it's everywhere.

00:10:55 <v Brian Okken>And then you could do a dry run like next minor or next major or next,

00:11:00 <v Speaker 3>I can't remember the bug.

00:11:01 <v Brian Okken>I always think of it as bug fix, but it's something else.

00:11:04 <v Brian Okken>Patch, patch release.

00:11:06 <v Brian Okken>And then it just, it pretends that it's doing it.

00:11:09 <v Brian Okken>If you do the dry run, it tells you everything that it's doing.

00:11:11 <v Brian Okken>And I'm like, that's exactly what I wanted to do.

00:11:14 <v Brian Okken>Awesome.

00:11:14 <v Brian Okken>So I think I'm going to change my, I'm going to try this out a little bit.

00:11:18 <v Brian Okken>And I think I'm going to change my workflow to be the, to make sure that I match this

00:11:23 <v Brian Okken>because it's a pretty, pretty reasonable workflow.

00:11:26 <v Brian Okken>So, and that way I can, when I want to, when I'm done with something, I can just go to the

00:11:31 <v Brian Okken>right branch and just make it, make it so.

00:11:34 <v Brian Okken>So I like the idea of throwing it in a tool, <v Brian Okken>a tool thing because I,

00:11:38 <v Brian Okken>or as a uv tool, <v Brian Okken>have it installed everywhere

00:11:41 <v Brian Okken>because I don't really want to have that <v Brian Okken>be a dependency on my package

00:11:44 <v Brian Okken>because it's not really, <v Brian Okken>it's a workflow thing.

00:11:47 <v Brian Okken>But anyway, uv tool, <v Brian Okken>I took a look at the repo.

00:11:51 <v Brian Okken>It's got 29 stars so far, <v Brian Okken>but it's pretty new, looks like.

00:11:55 <v Brian Okken>Just kind of started last week.

00:11:57 <v Brian Okken>So yeah, from Florian Wraths.

00:11:59 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, it was really interesting.

00:12:00 <v Michael Kennedy>That caught my attention as well.

00:12:02 <v Michael Kennedy>I've got some old repos <v Brian Okken>have 29 stars yeah yeah 29 not bad no it's off to a good start it's it's pretty cool i like the idea

00:12:10 <v Michael Kennedy>i just learned that uv has this version bumping feature and yeah it's it's quite nice i was i was

00:12:18 <v Brian Okken>using it as well i also surprised it doesn't have a ship button you you or pub uv publish isn't a

00:12:24 <v Michael Kennedy>thing though yeah it is it now oh there's i i you can do uv build and uv publish and on top of

00:12:31 <v Michael Kennedy>of that you can do uvpublish dash t and that will specify that you're using the token instead of your

00:12:40 <v Michael Kennedy>username so effectively setting the username like to underscore underscore token underscore underscore

00:12:44 <v Michael Kennedy>whatever you got to type if you just say uh like a twine publish or whatever so yeah it's got a

00:12:48 <v Brian Okken>really nice publish feature i mean so it's it's kind of like twine then um because i like right

00:12:54 <v Brian Okken>now i want to move everything over to trusted publishing but i still have a couple things that

00:12:58 <v Michael Kennedy>or not. So do you trust yourself? I mean, that's the question. Well, I don't actually, sometimes I

00:13:04 <v Michael Kennedy>don't trust myself either. That is so true. That is so true. Okay. Before we move off this uv thing

00:13:09 <v Michael Kennedy>really quick, I just learned yesterday, I was, I'm working on a project. I have always projects

00:13:14 <v Michael Kennedy>going in these little projects that I'm playing with and more and more, I'm building fun little

00:13:18 <v Michael Kennedy>utilities for me and they should be installed uv tool install. I want them broadly and I,

00:13:23 <v Michael Kennedy>but I'm not ready to put them on PyPI for sure. I don't really even want to put them on GitHub.

00:13:28 <v Michael Kennedy>And so the way I used to make those tools, I would say uv tool install either the thing from PyPI, like content types, or maybe which has an entry point script that becomes a command, right?

00:13:39 <v Michael Kennedy>Or I would put it on GitHub as a public repo and do the get plus or whatever you do, and it'll install it from there.

00:13:45 <v Michael Kennedy>I just learned yesterday that you can say uv tool install dash, is it dash E? I think it's dash E dot from a GitHub repository with a project.

00:13:56 <v Michael Kennedy>And that will install the tool in editable mode.

00:13:59 <v Michael Kennedy>So you just keep editing, and the tool is like a machine-wide command,

00:14:03 <v Michael Kennedy>but it's not coming from somewhere else.

00:14:05 <v Michael Kennedy>It's just coming from your working GitHub repo.

00:14:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, not GitHub repo, but you're just your directory.

00:14:11 <v Michael Kennedy>Your directory.

00:14:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:13 <v Michael Kennedy>That's what I mean.

00:14:13 <v Michael Kennedy>You're just your local directory.

00:14:14 <v Brian Okken>Isn't that cool?

00:14:15 <v Brian Okken>Oh, cool.

00:14:15 <v Brian Okken>Kind of like you can do pip install dash a dot, <v Brian Okken>and it just installs the local thing.

00:14:20 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, exactly.

00:14:21 <v Michael Kennedy>It's exactly the same, but it puts it into the uv tool install workflow.

00:14:26 <v Michael Kennedy>So it becomes like managed and global.

00:14:28 <v Brian Okken>That's pretty cool.

00:14:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, because the pip install dashi is like just if you activate that virtual environment sort of thing.

00:14:35 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:14:35 <v Brian Okken>Also, there's not a lot of harm in publishing to PyPI.

00:14:39 <v Brian Okken>I mean, people can't give you negative stars or anything.

00:14:42 <v Brian Okken>Nope.

00:14:43 <v Michael Kennedy>No, I just don't want to commit to having the thing the way it is.

00:14:46 <v Michael Kennedy>I just want to play with it before I even decide I want to put out in the world.

00:14:48 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:14:49 <v Michael Kennedy>But I want the coolness of the uv tool install equivalent that I don't have to juggle to find it.

00:14:54 <v Speaker 3>Nice.

00:14:54 <v Speaker 3>There it is.

00:14:55 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:14:55 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:14:55 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, let's talk about the speed, the speed of the new Python.

00:15:02 <v Michael Kennedy>We have a couple of new Python stories.

00:15:03 <v Michael Kennedy>I know you got a new Python thing.

00:15:04 <v Michael Kennedy>I got a new Python thing at the end in our extras.

00:15:07 <v Michael Kennedy>But 3.14 has felt like such a, it's going to come.

00:15:10 <v Michael Kennedy>It's going to happen.

00:15:11 <v Michael Kennedy>But no, here we are.

00:15:12 <v Michael Kennedy>We're just after the release of 3.14.

00:15:15 <v Michael Kennedy>You know that because Halloween is coming.

00:15:17 <v Michael Kennedy>So Miguel Grinberg wrote a nice article called Python 3.14 is here.

00:15:23 <v Michael Kennedy>How fast is it?

00:15:23 <v Michael Kennedy>It might surprise people to see what the graphs say.

00:15:26 <v Michael Kennedy>There's a lot of graphs.

00:15:27 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:15:28 <v Michael Kennedy>It also has a caveat.

00:15:30 <v Michael Kennedy>These are small scale benchmarks.

00:15:33 <v Michael Kennedy>So please don't be mad at me if your use case is different than my use case.

00:15:37 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:15:37 <v Michael Kennedy>That's how benchmarking goes.

00:15:39 <v Michael Kennedy>It's always fraught with, yeah, it's faster if you loop like that.

00:15:42 <v Michael Kennedy>But I do this other thing and mine is slower.

00:15:44 <v Michael Kennedy>So with that, as I said, there's a whole bunch of comparisons around here.

00:15:48 <v Michael Kennedy>So one of the biggest ones, I think the theme that comes away from this more

00:15:53 <v Michael Kennedy>and just there's some interesting trends is the threaded free threaded versus guild and can we

00:15:59 <v Michael Kennedy>call it guild that's like the opposite of free threaded right the guild python gilded the gilded

00:16:04 <v Michael Kennedy>age of python so there's a big comparison and sort of difference between the free threaded version

00:16:10 <v Speaker 3>and the standard traditional style another thing that's interesting is 311 was a big speed bump

00:16:17 <v Michael Kennedy>important performance i think that was probably the biggest performance jump for python pretty much

00:16:24 <v Michael Kennedy>at least in the modern recent times.

00:16:26 <v Michael Kennedy>3.11 is year over year the fastest jump, I think.

00:16:30 <v Michael Kennedy>That's really when this faster C-Python fruit came to be harvested,

00:16:34 <v Michael Kennedy>even though it was done in 3.9 and 3.10.

00:16:37 <v Michael Kennedy>And then it was almost flat, not 100% flat, but almost flat.

00:16:41 <v Michael Kennedy>And 3.14 is a little bit better, but there's a really interesting drop here.

00:16:45 <v Michael Kennedy>Also, PyPy, and I mean it this time, P-Y-P-Y, <v Michael Kennedy>3.11 is five times faster or something just eyeballing it on the graph than 3.14 so there's

00:16:56 <v Michael Kennedy>still that that said i never run pypy i'm not against it i like the project i think it's cool

00:17:01 <v Michael Kennedy>i think it's great people are doing that but just all my projects it's like well this dependency

00:17:06 <v Brian Okken>doesn't work with it so nope can't use it you know what i mean the whole two versus three problem

00:17:10 <v Brian Okken>yeah we haven't talked about it for a while so just just in case people aren't sure pypy.org

00:17:15 <v Brian Okken>and that is the project and it's it's not c python it's python implemented in python correct

00:17:22 <v Brian Okken>is that you think that's yeah i believe so and it's odd that it's faster right but it's

00:17:25 <v Michael Kennedy>fully jit compiled which is the deal that's why it's faster so but still 314 faster cool but

00:17:32 <v Michael Kennedy>this is this next picture here is getting to the interesting comparison so you've got

00:17:37 <v Michael Kennedy>standard and you've got the um the micro jit i guess that python has now right it's got the

00:17:44 <v Michael Kennedy>find a couple of instructions and do optimizations on it, but there's not a broad level optimization

00:17:50 <v Michael Kennedy>compared here. And then there's also the free-threaded Python. And across the board,

00:17:56 <v Michael Kennedy>I guess actually this picture is pretty much, this is pretty positive. 3.13, standard versus JIT,

00:18:01 <v Michael Kennedy>basically no difference. Actually, the JIT one's a little bit slower on some of these, but again,

00:18:04 <v Michael Kennedy>these are really small micro benchmarks, so it doesn't have a chance to build up its JIT advantage.

00:18:10 <v Michael Kennedy>pays the startup cost of it, but not the, <v Michael Kennedy>I don't know how much it's helping over time.

00:18:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, those are about the same, <v Michael Kennedy>but the free threaded version,

00:18:18 <v Michael Kennedy>probably 20% slower or more than regular Python.

00:18:21 <v Michael Kennedy>And I thought free threading was supposed to be fast, Brian.

00:18:24 <v Michael Kennedy>What's going on here?

00:18:25 <v Brian Okken>Well, it's a benchmark that isn't using thread.

00:18:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Yes, so what this is showing is it says, <v Michael Kennedy>if you are running in the free threaded Python,

00:18:35 <v Michael Kennedy>not even if you're using threading, <v Michael Kennedy>not all of your code is going to be multi-threaded.

00:18:40 <v Michael Kennedy>right most herego probably isn't but some of it will and that part presumably is computationally

00:18:45 <v Michael Kennedy>heavy so you'll get a big boost there but the parts where it's not you actually pay a price to

00:18:49 <v Michael Kennedy>slow it down but here's the interesting takeaway from this graph is in 313 that's like 20 25 slower

00:18:56 <v Brian Okken>it's a problem in 314 it's almost the same that's a really big deal it's a smidge the overhead is

00:19:03 <v Michael Kennedy>less. It's a smidge slower to do one thread on free threaded Python, but it's, it's removed so

00:19:10 <v Michael Kennedy>much of that. You're paying a huge penalty in your regular code. Right. So that's actually really

00:19:15 <v Michael Kennedy>cool. Now here's somewhere down here. If I go to find more threads. Okay. They have the fourth,

00:19:21 <v Michael Kennedy>the multi-threaded one here. There we go. Now this is the graph. There's a four thread version

00:19:27 <v Michael Kennedy>that says we're going to do true multi-threading. Look at the standard Python versus free thread.

00:19:33 <v Michael Kennedy>well on which is better but on Linux I think the four threads is it's not quite

00:19:40 <v Michael Kennedy>four times faster but it's pretty close it's a lot lot better yeah and also this

00:19:45 <v Michael Kennedy>is true that 3:13 to 3:14 the 3:13 version is maybe double the speed with four

00:19:51 <v Michael Kennedy>threads the 3:14 is almost four times like at least three times faster so it's it's a

00:19:57 <v Michael Kennedy>really good story I think the takeaway here is that 3:14 is not much faster but

00:20:01 <v Michael Kennedy>But the multi-threading doesn't have so many penalties,

00:20:05 <v Michael Kennedy>but it does also have the benefits, <v Michael Kennedy>which is exactly what you want.

00:20:08 <v Brian Okken>- Yeah.

00:20:08 <v Michael Kennedy>- There's still a compatibility story.

00:20:10 <v Michael Kennedy>Can you use free threading <v Michael Kennedy>'cause of your dependencies and so on?

00:20:13 <v Michael Kennedy>But at least the runtime behavior is kind of in line <v Michael Kennedy>with where you would expect.

00:20:17 <v Brian Okken>So, awesome.

00:20:18 <v Brian Okken>- It also looks, it's interesting that the using threads <v Brian Okken>without threads, without free threading,

00:20:25 <v Brian Okken>is faster on 14 than, like 14 got faster anyway, <v Michael Kennedy>even if you're not free threading.

00:20:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's awesome.

00:20:32 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:20:32 <v Michael Kennedy>So there's a whole lot more stuff going on here and comments down here if you want to get into them.

00:20:37 <v Michael Kennedy>But that's the main takeaway.

00:20:39 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, phew.

00:20:40 <v Michael Kennedy>I thought you were going to tell me that like 14 was slower or something.

00:20:44 <v Michael Kennedy>No, I don't think so.

00:20:45 <v Michael Kennedy>But it's not a tremendous boost for the regular one.

00:20:50 <v Michael Kennedy>That's not a reason not to upgrade, right?

00:20:52 <v Michael Kennedy>There's other benefits to it.

00:20:53 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:20:53 <v Brian Okken>And that also, I guess, makes sense why we still have two versions.

00:20:58 <v Brian Okken>We're shipping two versions of Python.

00:21:01 <v Michael Kennedy>yeah exactly luckily we have uv so it's it's it's like a no-op to use one or the other yeah it's one

00:21:08 <v Brian Okken>extra character to type exactly yeah okay it's it's lighter than air to to switch maybe um speaking

00:21:15 <v Brian Okken>of air lighter than air here you go uh so there's a new project and it's it is pretty new so this

00:21:22 <v Brian Okken>there's a project called air from the felderoys um daniel and audrey and they're the folks that

00:21:29 <v Brian Okken>brought us two scoops of Django. So this is a project called Air, and it's not that old either.

00:21:40 <v Brian Okken>Looks like a month or so, maybe. A lot of activity just recently, but it's already up to 525 stars.

00:21:46 <v Brian Okken>So we're watching it. And what is Air? Air is a new web framework that breathes fresh air into

00:21:54 <v Brian Okken>Python web development built with it's a it's built on top of FastAPI starlet and pedantic and

00:22:00 <v Brian Okken>there is I haven't really played with it but it's it's some interesting stuff one of the interesting

00:22:07 <v Brian Okken>things that is these air tags and I personally not sure how I feel about this but it's sort of

00:22:13 <v Brian Okken>fun looking at looking it down at some examples I'm guessing that these air tags are these things

00:22:19 <v Brian Okken>like air.html air.h1 so you can sort of programmatically generate html from it but

00:22:26 <v Brian Okken>um but apparently if you want a mix of that so you've got some stuff that's dynamic that you're

00:22:31 <v Brian Okken>using these air tag things to generate your html you can also do uh Jinja 2 templates at the same

00:22:37 <v Brian Okken>time um and and so that's kind of cool so you can kind of mix them wherever it makes sense

00:22:43 <v Brian Okken>in your application um and i'd i'd love to hear more about like the thought process around this

00:22:48 <v Brian Okken>but interesting and and from from some interesting people and i was taking a look at this and i'm

00:22:55 <v Brian Okken>like um uh uh plus the logo is kind of cute but the if you go to why it's this is this is why

00:23:02 <v Brian Okken>i wanted to cover this because it's awesome it says that air is uh it's it's highly unstable

00:23:09 <v Brian Okken>and experimental web framework we have not officially launched to the public yet every

00:23:13 <v Brian Okken>release could break your code if you have to ask why you should use it you probably it's probably

00:23:18 <v Brian Okken>not for you. It gets better. If you want to use Air, you can, but we don't recommend it.

00:23:24 <v Brian Okken>It's not enterprise ready and will likely never be, at least definitely not before the official

00:23:30 <v Brian Okken>launch. It also will likely infect you, your family and your code bases with an evil web

00:23:35 <v Brian Okken>framework mind virus. This is good. Distracting you and that you'll never ship and everything.

00:23:41 <v Brian Okken>So it's just, they recommend not using Air, but I think it's just really good writing and maybe

00:23:47 <v Brian Okken>reverse psychology.

00:23:48 <v Brian Okken>So kind of some fun mix of HTMX friendly stuff, <v Brian Okken>some of the best practices.

00:23:56 <v Brian Okken>And I guess reminding folks, <v Brian Okken>these folks are building websites all the time.

00:24:01 <v Brian Okken>So I'm interested to watch what they come up with here.

00:24:04 <v Speaker 3>Yeah, it looks very interesting.

00:24:06 <v Michael Kennedy>We'll see if it, I have no air metaphors.

00:24:10 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, no air metaphors.

00:24:10 <v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, it's an interesting project.

00:24:12 <v Brian Okken>All right.

00:24:13 <v Brian Okken>Those are our main topics.

00:24:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Do you have any extras?

00:24:17 <v Michael Kennedy>- I sure do.

00:24:18 <v Michael Kennedy>I have a couple I'll, I can go through quick.

00:24:20 <v Michael Kennedy>Some are quick, some are not as quick, <v Michael Kennedy>but they're all pretty quick.

00:24:22 <v Michael Kennedy>So I already talked to the Talk Python <v Michael Kennedy>and production book is out.

00:24:26 <v Michael Kennedy>It's doing great.

00:24:27 <v Michael Kennedy>By the way, Brian, something that is really <v Michael Kennedy>kind of mind blowing to me, but also really cool.

00:24:33 <v Michael Kennedy>You come over here to the ratings, <v Michael Kennedy>number one in software engineering on Amazon right now.

00:24:39 <v Michael Kennedy>That's awesome. - Wow.

00:24:41 <v Michael Kennedy>- I know.

00:24:42 <v Speaker 3>- That's great. - And an application.

00:24:43 <v Michael Kennedy>- Thank you.

00:24:43 <v Speaker 3>It's crazy.

00:24:45 <v Michael Kennedy>So I just wanna, the only thing is I've already announced that before, but it's doing really well.

00:24:49 <v Michael Kennedy>And I wrote a blog post sort of about some of the motivation behind it and some of the different things that people can check out and so on.

00:24:55 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'll link to that blog post.

00:24:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Next, here's one of these little tools that I created that I was telling you about that would be really perfect to uv tool install dash e sort of thing.

00:25:05 <v Michael Kennedy>Although I published it.

00:25:06 <v Michael Kennedy>No, it's not on PyPI yet, I don't believe.

00:25:08 <v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, it is.

00:25:09 <v Michael Kennedy>It is on PyPI.

00:25:09 <v Michael Kennedy>I did publish this one.

00:25:10 <v Michael Kennedy>I have a couple going.

00:25:11 <v Michael Kennedy>It's confusing.

00:25:12 <v Michael Kennedy>So this one here, let me give you a problem.

00:25:15 <v Speaker 3>Okay, Brian, you're working with your AI tools, your agentic AI.

00:25:19 <v Michael Kennedy>And one of the never-ending problems of working with these is if you run out of credits,

00:25:26 <v Michael Kennedy>you're either done for the month or you have to switch to pay-as-you-go billing.

00:25:30 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, for example, I had the $16 a month cursor plan,

00:25:35 <v Michael Kennedy>and then I started doing a whole bunch of projects.

00:25:37 <v Michael Kennedy>It was super successful.

00:25:38 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, I'm going to keep using this on the thing.

00:25:40 <v Michael Kennedy>But I ran out of credits, so I had to switch.

00:25:41 <v Michael Kennedy>I paid like $250 in overage credits for a month, <v Michael Kennedy>which I paid gladly because it solved tons of problems.

00:25:48 <v Michael Kennedy>If that was a person I hired to do that, <v Michael Kennedy>it would have both taken months instead of days,

00:25:53 <v Michael Kennedy>and it would have taken more than $200.

00:25:56 <v Michael Kennedy>That said, knowing, like, do I need to slow down, <v Michael Kennedy>or am I going to have a whole bunch of leftover prepaid credits

00:26:03 <v Michael Kennedy>with whatever plan you have?

00:26:04 <v Michael Kennedy>Knowing that is really helpful.

00:26:06 <v Michael Kennedy>So I created this really simple TUI that you run it, <v Michael Kennedy>and you configure it to know what your renewal day is.

00:26:13 <v Michael Kennedy>So if every month on the 16th, your credits renew, <v Michael Kennedy>and it's the 24th of the prior month, let's say,

00:26:20 <v Michael Kennedy>and you've used 30% of your credits, <v Michael Kennedy>if you keep going like that, are you going to run out?

00:26:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Or are you going to have a bunch left?

00:26:25 <v Michael Kennedy>In which case, maybe you tackle a bigger project <v Michael Kennedy>that you know is going to burn up a bunch of credits

00:26:30 <v Michael Kennedy>and you're waiting or something like that.

00:26:31 <v Michael Kennedy>So all you do is you run this thing called AI usage.

00:26:34 <v Michael Kennedy>You type in whatever percent your little tool tells you,

00:26:37 <v Michael Kennedy>like this picture here says, <v Michael Kennedy>You've used 35% of your credit.

00:26:40 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:26:41 <v Michael Kennedy>AI usage, 35.

00:26:42 <v Michael Kennedy>It says, cool, guess what?

00:26:43 <v Michael Kennedy>It's only day 12 of 31 out of your renewal days.

00:26:48 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you've used 25%, that's actually, or whatever, you know, this example is 25.

00:26:53 <v Michael Kennedy>So that's actually 13% less than if you were like on average using all of them.

00:26:58 <v Michael Kennedy>And so you're going to have by the end only use 64%.

00:27:01 <v Michael Kennedy>So you're going to have like 35% more you can go grind on.

00:27:03 <v Michael Kennedy>So go be ambitious or choose a more expensive but better resulting model or something like that.

00:27:07 <v Michael Kennedy>So that's a little utility I built for people.

00:27:09 <v Brian Okken>That's cool.

00:27:10 <v Brian Okken>Thanks.

00:27:10 <v Michael Kennedy>Let me rephrase that.

00:27:11 <v Michael Kennedy>I built it for myself, and then I just put it out there because I thought people might

00:27:14 <v Michael Kennedy>find it useful.

00:27:15 <v Michael Kennedy>You built it for other people that you actually also find useful.

00:27:19 <v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:27:20 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:27:21 <v Michael Kennedy>Then I did this little thread called Show Me Your LS, and unfortunately, I use sans-serif

00:27:26 <v Michael Kennedy>fonts, so it just looks like it says Show Me Your Is.

00:27:30 <v Michael Kennedy>You know, whatever.

00:27:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, I can't do it.

00:27:31 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm not changing my web fonts just for one post.

00:27:34 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, I wrote a blog post called Show Me Your LS and just trying to encourage people like, hey, play with some of these fun tools and so on.

00:27:40 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you look at the default terminal experience on Mac, even on a $3,000 Mac running 2025 latest OS, it's dreadful.

00:27:49 <v Michael Kennedy>I mean, like, oh, my gosh, it has like the folder name, then dash bash, dash bash, dash bash.

00:27:56 <v Michael Kennedy>Just like, oh, my God, what is this thing?

00:27:58 <v Michael Kennedy>Just put what I'm using out there now.

00:28:00 <v Michael Kennedy>So right now I'm using this one that basically shows icons for

00:28:03 <v Michael Kennedy>the different file types that uses the .gitignore to show hidden or

00:28:07 <v Michael Kennedy>unhidden files and developer conventions and it shows the file size and

00:28:11 <v Michael Kennedy>human readable sizes and stuff like that.

00:28:12 <v Michael Kennedy>So I just thought I wanted to inspire people to play around a little.

00:28:15 <v Michael Kennedy>So people can check that out.

00:28:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, so people want to check out this little blog post and

00:28:22 <v Michael Kennedy>get inspired about making your terminal better.

00:28:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Also, have you heard of Helium, the browser?

00:28:27 <v Michael Kennedy>I think you mentioned, maybe, I don't know.

00:28:29 <v Michael Kennedy>I think I have.

00:28:30 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:28:30 <v Michael Kennedy>So it's the best privacy and unbiased ad blocker by default.

00:28:34 <v Michael Kennedy>So it comes built in with ad blocker, ad block plus.

00:28:37 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't know what, some kind of ad block, <v Michael Kennedy>one of the better ad blocks as part of the thing.

00:28:41 <v Michael Kennedy>And it's based on Chrome and so on.

00:28:42 <v Michael Kennedy>And, you know, it's, it's kind of neat.

00:28:44 <v Michael Kennedy>It's basically a Chromium browser.

00:28:45 <v Michael Kennedy>It's not pulling me away from Vivaldi at any moment right now.

00:28:48 <v Michael Kennedy>I really like the way Vivaldi works and the customizations and the side tabs

00:28:52 <v Michael Kennedy>and all that kind of stuff.

00:28:53 <v Michael Kennedy>But I was just poking around like, oh, that's interesting.

00:28:55 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm always here for understanding new browsers.

00:28:58 <v Michael Kennedy>Come over to the GitHub repo.

00:29:00 <v Michael Kennedy>See what it says about languages?

00:29:02 <v Michael Kennedy>97.4% Python.

00:29:03 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, wow.

00:29:04 <v Speaker 3>That's cool.

00:29:05 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:29:05 <v Michael Kennedy>So it's not that the entire browser is Python <v Michael Kennedy>because it just is wrapping Chromium,

00:29:10 <v Michael Kennedy>which is C, C++, something like that.

00:29:13 <v Michael Kennedy>But what's interesting is if you just look around, <v Michael Kennedy>it's full of all these little Python scripts

00:29:18 <v Michael Kennedy>to basically take Chromium and build it into an entire browser,

00:29:21 <v Michael Kennedy>which I thought was pretty interesting.

00:29:23 <v Michael Kennedy>So people might want to look around this repo.

00:29:26 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, we could use a handful of forks then to make some cool stuff.

00:29:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, exactly.

00:29:31 <v Michael Kennedy>All right, the last thing is super short.

00:29:33 <v Michael Kennedy>I present to you the world's smallest CPython release, 3.13.9 final, released yesterday.

00:29:41 <v Michael Kennedy>It has literally one change in spec to get source lines.

00:29:45 <v Michael Kennedy>And that change is to deal with the case when a decorator is followed by a comment and then the function.

00:29:52 <v Michael Kennedy>Something about the lines gets messed up.

00:29:54 <v Michael Kennedy>Amazing that they released it.

00:29:56 <v Michael Kennedy>I mean, I know it's important for certain things, <v Michael Kennedy>but normally these things are just like scroll, scroll,

00:30:01 <v Michael Kennedy>like changes, changes, changes, changes, changes.

00:30:03 <v Michael Kennedy>So anyway, 3.13.9 is out, <v Michael Kennedy>though it's likely it's not something you need to rush out and install.

00:30:10 <v Michael Kennedy>You should install 3.14 anyway.

00:30:12 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, maybe it was just a schedule, whatever's in there.

00:30:15 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, perhaps.

00:30:16 <v Michael Kennedy>A couple weeks later.

00:30:17 <v Brian Okken>All right, over to you.

00:30:18 <v Brian Okken>Well, we have another release that I was going to talk about,

00:30:22 <v Brian Okken>which is 315.

00:30:23 <v Brian Okken>So 315 alpha one is out already.

00:30:28 <v Brian Okken>Hugo posted a couple of days ago and major new features.

00:30:32 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:30:33 <v Brian Okken>So it's, <v Brian Okken>it's, <v Brian Okken>it's pretty new stuff already cause but it's,

00:30:36 <v Brian Okken>it's rolling out so people can, <v Brian Okken>there's a play with that dedicated profiling package for profile,

00:30:42 <v Brian Okken>profiling tools.

00:30:44 <v Brian Okken>This one's actually kind of cool.

00:30:45 <v Brian Okken>Pep 686 Python now uses UTF eight as the default encoding.

00:30:50 <v Brian Okken>It has kind of bugged me that when I encode stuff, it doesn't default to UTF-8, but now it does.

00:30:57 <v Brian Okken>So that's good.

00:30:58 <v Brian Okken>Actually, it doesn't really bug me that much because I usually just specify the UTF-8 encoding.

00:31:04 <v Speaker 3>Yeah, I do too.

00:31:05 <v Michael Kennedy>But you don't want to forget.

00:31:06 <v Michael Kennedy>And it's not an enumeration.

00:31:08 <v Michael Kennedy>It's a string.

00:31:09 <v Michael Kennedy>You've got to just type UTF-8.

00:31:11 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, so there'll be less of that typing now.

00:31:14 <v Brian Okken>It'll be good.

00:31:15 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, one of the things that I think while we were talking about last week about testing, testing for 314, you may as well get, you know, while you're mucking with your toxiny file, you can you can go ahead and turn on 315 testing just in case something something comes up in 315 that makes it you have to modify it.

00:31:37 <v Brian Okken>I probably wouldn't put it in CI right now or somehow put it in CI that it doesn't stop you from shipping.

00:31:44 <v Brian Okken>But for local testing, why not?

00:31:47 <v Brian Okken>And to help you with local testing, you can already pip install it with or not pip install it,

00:31:53 <v Brian Okken>but you can uv Python install 315 because Astral's uv supports 315 now.

00:32:00 <v Brian Okken>So that's cool.

00:32:01 <v Brian Okken>I'm glad Astral exists.

00:32:04 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:32:05 <v Brian Okken>I could never remember how to install the alpha releases and stuff.

00:32:10 <v Brian Okken>And it just, it's easy now.

00:32:12 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:32:12 <v Brian Okken>We, I threatened to write a few blog posts.

00:32:16 <v Brian Okken>So I did lazy imports.

00:32:19 <v Brian Okken>We talked about it might come in.

00:32:21 <v Brian Okken>It's a proposal that hasn't been accepted yet for 3.15, but you can use, there's techniques

00:32:28 <v Brian Okken>for using lazy imports right now.

00:32:29 <v Brian Okken>And these are not complicated.

00:32:31 <v Brian Okken>This isn't something extra you install.

00:32:33 <v Brian Okken>But I posted Python lazy imports you can use today on pythontest.com.

00:32:39 <v Brian Okken>And also just a quick rundown of all the things that I mostly wrote it for me,

00:32:45 <v Brian Okken>all the things I change when I add some testing for a new version.

00:32:50 <v Brian Okken>So I updated testing in 3.14 and almost immediately got some feedback to add.

00:32:58 <v Brian Okken>I tried to give a shout out.

00:33:00 <v Brian Okken>Christian Klaus said, hey, you forgot free threading.

00:33:03 <v Brian Okken>So I added a section to all the stuff I changed to support free threaded Python.

00:33:10 <v Brian Okken>Nice.

00:33:11 <v Speaker 3>Not the guild version.

00:33:12 <v Brian Okken>Not the guild, but non-fish version.

00:33:16 <v Brian Okken>So it's just mostly adding a 3.14T in a couple places.

00:33:20 <v Brian Okken>But I was checking out.

00:33:22 <v Brian Okken>I'm like, well, do I need to do something special about the Trove classifiers?

00:33:28 <v Brian Okken>And I went and looked.

00:33:30 <v Brian Okken>And there are, I didn't realize this before.

00:33:32 <v Brian Okken>You can add a free-threading Trove classifier now <v Brian Okken>if you want to broadcast that you're supporting free-threading on PyPI.

00:33:41 <v Brian Okken>You can add that.

00:33:43 <v Brian Okken>And there's also how stable it is.

00:33:47 <v Brian Okken>So there's non-free-threaded stability, <v Brian Okken>but apparently you can have stable, unstable, beta,

00:33:55 <v Brian Okken>resilient as far as free-threading goes.

00:33:57 <v Brian Okken>So if you're working on supporting it and it mostly works,

00:34:01 <v Brian Okken>you can sort of advertise that if you want, I guess.

00:34:04 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, lovely.

00:34:05 <v Michael Kennedy>I didn't know about the Trove classifiers either.

00:34:07 <v Michael Kennedy>Going forward, that's going to be a thing.

00:34:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and I guess that's it for extras.

00:34:12 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:34:13 <v Speaker 3>I got a joke for you, obviously.

00:34:15 <v Michael Kennedy>This one is a Linux joke.

00:34:17 <v Michael Kennedy>Are you familiar with Arch Linux?

00:34:20 <v Michael Kennedy>Vaguely.

00:34:20 <v Michael Kennedy>Vaguely.

00:34:21 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'm pretty much me as well.

00:34:23 <v Michael Kennedy>But the zen of Arch Linux is that it's the absolute minimal,

00:34:28 <v Michael Kennedy>most empty thing set up that then you choose like, <v Michael Kennedy>oh, I want to have this kind of shell.

00:34:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, I want to have this feature.

00:34:35 <v Michael Kennedy>And everything is adding it in, right?

00:34:37 <v Brian Okken>Oh, okay.

00:34:38 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:34:38 <v Michael Kennedy>So there's, you know, some upside to that.

00:34:41 <v Michael Kennedy>So anyway, the joke is here we have the small, <v Michael Kennedy>presumably geeky little programmer type in an orange jumpsuit in a jail

00:34:49 <v Michael Kennedy>sitting next to the biggest, toughest looking thug you can imagine.

00:34:53 <v Michael Kennedy>The thug says, killed a man.

00:34:55 <v Michael Kennedy>You, little character looks over and says, <v Michael Kennedy>I installed apt on Arch Linux.

00:34:59 <v Michael Kennedy>Dude, what?

00:35:00 <v Michael Kennedy>The guys creeped.

00:35:01 <v Michael Kennedy>Like the big thugs.

00:35:02 <v Michael Kennedy>Like all creeped out.

00:35:02 <v Michael Kennedy>What are you doing, bro?

00:35:04 <v Michael Kennedy>God, get away from me.

00:35:09 <v Michael Kennedy>It's good, right?

00:35:10 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:35:11 <v Michael Kennedy>So you got the comments.

00:35:13 <v Michael Kennedy>Kind of want to do this now.

00:35:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Go ahead.

00:35:15 <v Michael Kennedy>Love it.

00:35:15 <v Michael Kennedy>I love it.

00:35:16 <v Michael Kennedy>How I can understand these jokes now.

00:35:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Someone says like, I'm getting good at Linux.

00:35:20 <v Michael Kennedy>I know what it means.

00:35:22 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:35:23 <v Michael Kennedy>What is apt?

00:35:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Do you know?

00:35:25 <v Michael Kennedy>Apt?

00:35:25 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:35:25 <v Michael Kennedy>It's the thing you install.

00:35:28 <v Michael Kennedy>It's like the pip of Ubuntu and stuff.

00:35:31 <v Michael Kennedy>You apt install.

00:35:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:35:33 <v Brian Okken>Just doubted myself for not using Linux for a very long time.

00:35:37 <v Brian Okken>So, yeah.

00:35:38 <v Michael Kennedy>Dude, don't get away from me, you monster.

00:35:44 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, I thought it was fun.

00:35:45 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, that's fun.

00:35:47 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:35:47 <v Michael Kennedy>Plus, the art is nice.

00:35:48 <v Michael Kennedy>The art is lovely.

00:35:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, the art is really good.

00:35:51 <v Michael Kennedy>I think I appreciate art a little bit more now that there's a lot of vibe in art.

00:35:55 <v Brian Okken>you see real art you're like that's nice yeah and this isn't art but i was we commented before we

00:35:59 <v Brian Okken>started recording i'm just loving the kind of the blue lighting that my robot is experiencing right

00:36:05 now today that's nature's light nature's light yeah it's cold out um anyway um awesome uh episode

00:36:11 today again and thanks michael thanks everybody for listening we'll catch you next week catch you
