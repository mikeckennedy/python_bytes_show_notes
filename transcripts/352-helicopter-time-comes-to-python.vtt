Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to earbuds.


00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.360
This is episode 352 recorded September 12th, 2023. I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.560
And I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:20.720
And this episode is sponsored by us, supported by us, support the podcast by choosing our courses,


00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.920

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.480
and the Patreon supporters and find us on fostedon.org.


00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.680
Brian, me, and the show, the links in the show notes,


00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.720
and also the show notes have how to attend


00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.360
the live session if you want.


00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.200
- Yes.


00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.040
- Brian, when do you got to start our day here?


00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.920
- I feel like it's the start of school,


00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.200
so I feel like a helicopter parent.


00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.680
- No, that's right.


00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.080
You got your homework done?


00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.080
Was anyone mean to you?


00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.520
Can I help you out, sweetie?


00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.560
(laughing)


00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.360
- So the first topic is called Heliclockter,


00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.780
And it is, like, apparently it's a pun


00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.980
on helicopter parenting, maybe?


00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.820
I don't know.


00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.400
So, like helicopter, but clock, get it?


00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.200
Kind of a heliclock.


00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.700
So this was submitted by Peter Nielsen.


00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.260
I think he was involved in this,


00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.260
but the idea is, it's like date times,


00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.180
but they're a little bit better.


00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.180
So apparently one of the frustrations


00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.540
that this group had was with normal date times,


00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.300
they looked into other things, is being able to just have a


00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.180
date time where you can just enter the time, but have it be


00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.980
aware of what time zone it's in. So the big thing about this


00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.380
is a subclass of date time with some extra features. So you've


00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.220
got a date time TZ, which is a time zone aware date time, and


00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.180
then you've got a local one, which ensures that the time


00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.100
zone is local time and then a UTC.


00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.700
There are some other solutions out there that deal with,


00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.140
just assume UTC plus zero,


00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.040
but that's often not convenient.


00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.100
I guess one of the things they had was they wanted to be able to


00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.360
have daytime items as objects and then be able to sort them,


00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.800
but have them keep,


00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.920
maintain what time zone they were created in and stuff,


00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.020
which is an interesting thing.


00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.700
It looks just like working with time zones.


00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.780
So it looks pretty easy to work with


00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.620
if you've ever worked with time zones.


00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.740
They do have some other cool features like statically


00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.540
type-checkable and pedantic integration,


00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.940
which is neat.


00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.200
Anyway, they've got also an article about why they created it.


00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.380
Time flies when you're having zones.


00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.920
Nice. So it's a pretty interesting discussion


00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.880
going through why they chose the solution they did of creating their own and everything.


00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.960
Being able to use it with mypy also is kind of cool.


00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.760
>> Yeah.


00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.160
>> Yeah.


00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.960
>> Neat time zone.


00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.800
>> Shout out to Arrow and Pendulum as well,


00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.120
or some of the other well-known ones.


00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.560
>> Yeah. Even at daytime UTC they found,


00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.440
but it's UTC zero.


00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.120
Then they even talked about how they designed it and why.


00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.280
Their first thing was just create a completely new type,


00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.520
But then they came up with some problems with that.


00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.520
So they came up with subclassing.


00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.400
So then these new types are types of date/time also,


00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.160
so you can use other things to go with them.


00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
So I think that's a cool solution.


00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.240
I'm not usually a fan of subclassing,


00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.160
but I think the subclassing in this case


00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.680
makes a lot of sense.


00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.280
Anyway, what you got for us?


00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.840
- That looks good.


00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.020
I think it sounds so easy to be working with time,


00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.200
but it's always so tricky.


00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.740
I have something keeping with the same color scheme here,


00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.000
a new release for Wagtail.


00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.880
And I don't believe we've talked about Wagtail before.


00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.180
It's possible.


00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.320
I did get a chance to use our search today, you know,


00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.380
and just reminded how nicely that goes.


00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.560
I guess we talked, at least mentioned it somewhere,


00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.920
but Wagtail is a CMS,


00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.920
the leading open source Python CMS built on Django,


00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.080
but you don't necessarily have to know Django.


00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.280
It's kind of like WordPress in the sense that you could just go through the setup


00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.840
steps and run WordPress and not even worry about the fact it's written in PHP.


00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.460
So Wagtail is a little bit like that, but just pip install Wagtail to go get going.


00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.740
And it's got some really cool features.


00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.000
I haven't really explored it too much, but it's got this really cool visual


00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.980
designer for people to build out web pages and stuff.


00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.800
Isn't that cool?


00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.800
So you can like hit a little plus and get like a nice whizzy wig.


00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.160
I'm gonna insert a heading or insert a table or


00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.760
like a image gallery with these images.


00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.040
It has a cool tree structure so you can organize your content.


00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.000
And because it's Django, you can extend it doing Django things,


00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.720
which is pretty sweet.


00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.400
And it has a bunch of,


00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.560
you can make little snippets that you can use inside your pages.


00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.960
So that's pretty neat.


00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.520
And it even has a library for managing your images.


00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.040
So pretty cool stuff.


00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.960
And the news item today is an article by Megan Voss.


00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.680
come over to the dark side with a Wagtail 5.


00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.960
So Wagtail 5.0 is a new release here


00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.120
with a bunch of cool things.


00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.440
So dark mode, if you want your website,


00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.120
which is backed by Wagtail to have dark mode,


00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.760
well, dark mode is a thing, which is pretty excellent.


00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.760
I'm a big fan of dark mode.


00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.560
It has SVG image support in addition


00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.120
of scalable vector graphics,


00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.320
in addition to just JPEGs and stuff.


00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.640
It has an accessibility, an enhanced accessibility checker.


00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.480
That's pretty cool.


00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.060
If you're creating content and it's hard for people who have to use screen


00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.020
readers or something, it can tell you that you're not doing that.


00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.460
Like, missing paragraphs is heading.


00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.680
I miss using paragraphs as headings, use proper tags, incorrect heading


00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.360
hierarchy, avoid skipping levels.


00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.940
Oh, wow.


00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.180
And you know, things like that.


00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.460
Right.


00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.020
But yeah, certainly my, my handwritten stuff.


00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.940
That's only, you know, if I remember that, that's how it's supposed to go.


00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.240
Right.


00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.460
So pretty sweet.


00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.780
What's wrong with five H ones on one page.


00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.100
No, I know.


00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.380
I really, I really have a lot to say here.


00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:11.900
so it's all H1s. It also has, what is the, when you, if you want to delete, like say


00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.820
you have an image or something, it's in your gallery and you're like, ah, not going to


00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.020
use this after all, hit delete. It keeps track of if it's used in any other pages, so you


00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.100
don't accidentally delete something that's being used in some part of the site you didn't


00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.460
know about that someone else created. That's pretty awesome. More snippets, more validation,


00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.300
and they threw away a bunch of old code so they can work better, which, you know, may


00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.060
even have a blog post on addressing technical debt.


00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.400
But so few breaking changes, not too many, but yeah, check it out.


00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.260
Anyway, Wagtail looks pretty awesome, right?


00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.800
I think I may have talked about a long time ago, but anyway,


00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.460
not the 5.0 release because that's quite recent.


00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.700
Yeah, I think it's it's pretty cool that that's there.


00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.820
And I do have plans to play with it at some point,


00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.520
but I've had plans to play with it for a while.


00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.320
So indeed, Kim, the audience says, I know several one person


00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.960
technical businesses that really like Wagtail for their sites.


00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.340
easy to use for technical, competent users, but doesn't require much of their time to maintain.


00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.300
Yeah, that seems great.


00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.100
Yeah, nice.


00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.940
Over to you.


00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.340
Well, I guess I go away from Python a little bit, but we use it all the time.


00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.740
So I want to talk about Git.


00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:26.860
So I don't think I use any other revision control systems anymore other than Git.


00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.500
No CVS?


00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.460
No.


00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.580
No clear-C?


00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.140
No good stuff?


00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.820
Of course.


00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.020
Subversion, actually I touch on subversion once in a while.


00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.860
But--


00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.820
- I still have kind of good feelings towards subversion.


00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.420
The other ones make me a little queasy.


00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.740
- Anyway, the thing that I often wanna know


00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.940
is just like the stuff that happened recently


00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.940
on a file or something, or just on a Git repository.


00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.720
RCS, Mike Felder, oh, Fiedler, sorry.


00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.560
Nice, RCS, wow.


00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.340
Takes me back.


00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.220
But so get one of the things is to get log.


00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:07.780
So looking at what's happened recently, but the the get log output is not something I


00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.220
like to do.


00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:15.700
Actually using get log is one of the reasons why I often pop up like a visual tool to look


00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.220
at my get repository because it's gross.


00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.780
But I forgot I and I know I knew that you could customize it, but I kind of forgot how


00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.340
how to, so I haven't been, but this now I have because of this article.


00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.020
So there's an article called Get Log Customization from Justin Joyce.


00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.660
And so the default is something like that, which we're showing.


00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.140
It's got a really long hash number and a bunch of information,


00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.740
but it's hard to find the information you need.


00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:51.140
One of the things that Justin points out is that you can do just something really easy by passing in one line.


00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.980
just the flag, the done, like two dashes and one line,


00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.100
all one word, will make it pretty nice actually.


00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.020
It just does a short hash and you can kind of see


00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.100
what's going on a little bit better,


00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.180
but it goes a lot further.


00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.860
And I'm gonna hop down to this really cool customization.


00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.220
One of the things is using graph.


00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.940
Graph is great, --graph,


00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.180
so that you can see kind of,


00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.180
it does like kind of a visual representation


00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.060
the different, what are those?


00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.020
>> The branches and the merges.


00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.460
>> Branches, that's it. I always forget branches and branch or fork.


00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.260
>> And ASCII art for the win there.


00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.820
>> Yeah, ASCII art.


00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.700
But then you can do color and stuff.


00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:39.340
So the graph does color also if you have that on everything.


00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.660
But it also talks about how the one line is actually


00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.100
a combination of pretty one line and abbreviate commit,


00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.460
which is cool.


00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:57.380
Then what I really love is this thing that he comes up with at the end.


00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.580
I didn't know that you could put aliases in the Git config file,


00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.420
or at least I did once and I forgot about it.


00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.060
But this is a pretty cool long alias.


00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.740
He's got LG instead of log.


00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.220
Save a character of typing right there.


00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:18.060
But it defaults to, so it's an alias for log with a graph with 10,


00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.180
so default to the last 10 commits.


00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.620
Then this long format thing that is ugly to look at,


00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.940
but what you get,


00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.380
he talks about what it all is,


00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.660
but what you get is the graph,


00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:36.260
but you also get somebody's name highlighted of who did it,


00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.460
and then also how long ago.


00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.020
Was it 19 hours ago,


00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.060
or 24 hours ago, or two days?


00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.460
three days, really cool.


00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.740
Exactly what I need usually when I'm looking at a Git log.


00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.740
>> I love it. This actually inspires me to maybe play with this as well.


00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.300
I usually use SourceTree.


00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.500
I really like SourceTree,


00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.420
but sometimes you're already in the terminal and just.


00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.580
>> Yeah. What I did is I just opened up


00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.780
my home directory Git config and added this alias,


00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.340
and now I just use Git-LG.


00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.780
Then I can forget all of this.


00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.140
One of the neat things,


00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.460
I'm like, well, if it says by default,


00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.940
you can put the default whatever you want for this alias,


00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.560
but 10 lines, what if I want to see 20 lines or 30 lines?


00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.480
Well, if you say getLG,


00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.360
even though it has the -10 built into it and pass in a -20 or -30,


00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.140
the second one overrides it.


00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.640
>> That's clever.


00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.940
>> Works just fine. So nice.


00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.700
So thank you, Justin Joyce, for writing this up.


00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.020
>> Nice job, Justin. That's pretty awesome.


00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:44.380
All right. I saw that David Lord was the one listed there in the example.


00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:44.880
Yeah.


00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.480
Let's keep going with that theme.


00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:46.980
Okay.


00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.580
So over to historically from the Flask side of things.


00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.420
So I want to talk about Flask.


00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.180
I want to talk about Jinja.


00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:01.580
So Jinja is the templating language that is the default for so many frameworks.


00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.340
It's not best, I don't think.


00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.700
Come on, Chameleon.


00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.020
So much better.


00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.520
But it doesn't matter if everyone's using Jinja,


00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.660
like that's what people are using, right?


00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.780
It's built into all the frameworks.


00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.780
You gotta jump through hoops to like use Chameleon


00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.240
with say FastAPI, right?


00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.900
Like I created a library to do that kind of stuff.


00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.960
But this is about Jinja and its origins come from Flask,


00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.380
originally created by Armin Roeniger,


00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.200
no longer the maintainer, David Lord


00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.420
and folks over at Palettes is.


00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.180
But this new project I wanna give a shout out to


00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.840
does come from Armin and it's called Mini Jinja.


00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.840
Like Jinja, but smaller.


00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.840
So MiniJinja is a powerful but minimal dependency template engine for Rust


00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.840
that's compatible with Jinja and Jinja 2.


00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.840
So if you've got a Rust project and you want to have those templates,


00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.840
you could use this and you'd be like, "Okay, might go well."


00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.840
Python podcast. So yeah, Rust's popular, but it's comparable if you've got a Python app.


00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.840
It's basically not 100% identical, but pretty similar, right?


00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.840
The other thing though, that's kind of interesting is,


00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.840
it does works with Python through this project called


00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.840
mini-ginja-py, and that allows you to use the Rust


00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.840
runtime-backed template engine on whatever thing it is that you're working with.


00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.840
Flask, FastAPI, whatever.


00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.840
So, you might want to use this.


00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.840
Instead, when the full set of Ginja 2 features is not required,


00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.640
is not required and you want to have the same experience across Python or Rust.


00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:38.080
There's places where you can get a slightly better performance sometimes than Jinja.


00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.280
It was created using maturing and Pi 03,


00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.160
which is pretty cool, like the Rust Python bindings.


00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.240
Yeah, it just shows you how to set up and whatnot.


00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.080
So if you're out there doing the web things,


00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.960
maybe have a quick look at Mini Jinja if somehow that's relevant to you.


00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.720
>> Continuing the rustification of Python.


00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.320
>> Indeed. You know it's been around for a long time,


00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.440
over 30 years, so surely some rust is starting to develop.


00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.660
I wouldn't have expected to come on so quickly all at once like that,


00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.720
but there you go.


00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.400
>> Yeah, nice.


00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.840
>> That's it for all of our items, I would say.


00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.680
>> Okay.


00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.480
>> I've got some extras,


00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.720
but I know you do too, so maybe you go first.


00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:23.400
>> Okay. Well, we were just talking at the beginning of this,


00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.160
before we went on air,


00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
that I was having some audio trouble last night,


00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.440
but I was getting the pytest primary power course ready


00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.200
and launched last night.


00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.860
So chapter six, got done recording that yesterday morning


00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.640
and in the evening finished editing the audio.


00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.560
So the first course in a series, pytest primary power,


00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.940
and to sell, so what does it cover?


00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.360
It covers test functions, fixtures, built-in fixtures,


00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.600
parameterization markers,


00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.940
and it's really the set of things I think


00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.600
that you have to know to be able


00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.720
to be using pytest effectively.


00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.440
You could just take this first course


00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.460
and I think run with it for quite a long time.


00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.520
So to celebrate getting it done and back to school,


00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.800
I know everybody's with kids.


00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.560
The kids are probably started last week or the week before.


00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.780
- It might sound like it's for school,


00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.940
but now the kids are out of the house.


00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.880
You actually have time and energy to study things again.


00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.960
That's my house anyway.


00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.100
- Yeah, yeah.


00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.520
So I'm offering a deal for it.


00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.200
So 49 bucks for the first course


00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.120
and if you wanna do the bundle, $99.


00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.000
And the bundle's kind of fun because I've already had some,


00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.280
we've got a lot of channels to get feedback.


00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.720
I had some feedback this last night and this morning


00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.440
saying, "Hey, I'm trying this on Python 3.8


00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.160
"and it doesn't work."


00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.000
But it does now.


00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.460
So this morning I did the,


00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.080
it was like the from future import annotations I had to do


00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.080
to make the annotations from 3.10 be compatible


00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.760
to Python, way back to Python 3.7.


00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.760
So I tested it on 3.7 this morning.


00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.640
So everything should be working.


00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.920
So anyway, pretty excited about that.


00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.440
- Excellent, yeah, congratulations.


00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.280
That's a big step.


00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.600
- If you see something like this,


00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.560
you're in the right place.


00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.560
So thanks.


00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.760
How about you?


00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.920
- That's the testing code logo.


00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.480
Enroll in the course for 49 bucks, awesome.


00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.400
Keeping with the course theme a little bit,


00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.240
I have three new courses coming out at Talk Python Training.


00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.680
We have a new HTMX plus Django course,


00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.000
which is gonna be excellent.


00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.640
A new language-based course without more detail on that.


00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.140
and one or two data science courses coming in quite soon.


00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.200
And since it's a bunch of things,


00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.480
all of them not quite released yet,


00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.480
just point people at training.talkpython.fm/getnotified


00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.320
and there, if you're not already in the mailing list,


00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.800
put your name and email in here


00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.360
and you'll get to hear about them


00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.400
or keep listening to the podcast.


00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.040
I'm sure I'll talk about it then as well.


00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.340
I also just wanna give a shout out to Cloudflare Turnstile.


00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:58.540
I've been going through and classifying trucks, cars, crosswalks, stoplights.


00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.600
Holy moly.


00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.820
What a dreadful unnecessary thing.


00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:09.940
So way back in three or four, you know, October, 2022, I talked about


00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:14.100
turnstile, which is a privacy friendly, private, user-friendly


00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.220
privacy, perversing and preserving.


00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.520
Alternative to recapture and all those things.


00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.060
And it just sits down here.


00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.400
And while we're waiting, you know how, like sometimes if you are slow filling


00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.680
out a form, it'll say your selection of taxis has expired and you got to do it


00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:34.200
again, this one automatically, I saw it while I was waiting for you to talk


00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.680
about your new course and bundle.


00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.000
That thing just did a little flicker and regenerated its validation with no


00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.680
user input, just in the background.


00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.240
Telling you.


00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:42.760
Come on.


00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.520
So how does it know you're not a robot?


00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:50.000
You know, it runs some JavaScript and it also, I think, you know,


00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.440
I don't remember all the details.


00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.980
It runs through a bunch of other heuristics that like they know from,


00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.860
I think from your IP address talking to,


00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.980
because you know Cloudflare like fronts something like 25 percent of the internet.


00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.020
So they can tell if you're going to a bunch of different sites and things,


00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.620
and it kind of uses that background information, I think.


00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.680
Anyway, I have not even had to find a taxi to be able to submit that.


00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.280
>> But it's made it so that you don't have a bunch of automated stuff coming in.


00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:17.880
Exactly.


00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.960
People used to be hammering on it, doing all sorts of bad stuff.


00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.400
Yeah.


00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.120
That's not good.


00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.920
Yep.


00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.120
So, yeah, I'd add it for like the login page.


00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.640
Um, and for the, the registration page, a bunch of bots were signing up.


00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.880
I'm like, I don't understand why they're signing up because it's a free account


00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.400
and you don't really get anything for free.


00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.520
So I couldn't understand why they're all, but hundreds of them were signing up.


00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.120
Okay.


00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.120
I'm kind of do something.


00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.680
And then, this is an improvement over recapture.


00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.760
All right.


00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.460
Pie Bay, Pie Bay is coming up October 8th.


00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:54.400
I will be there speaking about Python type hints and how you can


00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.300
super power your apps, something like five amazing ways and tools you can use


00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.940
with your apps, I believe is what my topic is roughly supposed to be, but I will be


00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:08.200
there and, people can, they happen to be in the San Francisco area or area or


00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:08.760
wanting to be there.


00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.860
They can check it out.


00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.120
They gave me a coupon, say friend of speaker.


00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.260
If you use that friend of speaker, no spaces,


00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.980
you get 20 percent off regular tickets.


00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.380
So that's always fun.


00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:18.940
>> Nice.


00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.500
>> Yeah. Always a fun trip,


00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.860
a road trip down to San Francisco.


00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.600
Let's see, following up on your doc strings.


00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.500
We got some really nice follow-up here, Brian.


00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.980
Rhett Turnbull says, "With regard to


00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.860
the doc strings article Brian covered last episode,


00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.020
the Google format allows for a raises section."


00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.780
Remember I said, "Oh, it'd be awesome if you could


00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.540
say actually what errors could happen."


00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:41.940
>> Yeah.


00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.100
>> That's really cool. Rhett


00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.600
uses Google DocString format for projects,


00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.460
type hints, descriptive variable names,


00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.020
MKDocs and MKDocs strings,


00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.180
get pretty docs for free,


00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.780
and VS Code will pull DocString


00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.940
so you can see them in the editor,


00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.060
and Copilot practically writes the DocStrings for you,


00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.300
which is excellent.


00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.260
And one second, attribution.


00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.180
John Hagen sent over something saying pretty similar,


00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.460
say, remember we said,


00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.660
look, you don't necessarily need to include the type


00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.940
in the DocString if there's a type hint,


00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.540
and sure enough, you don't have to.


00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.380
- Oh, cool.


00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.380
it a description, which is cool, and also points out the syntax for how you use the


00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:22.060
raises. So you say raises and you give it a list of exception types, and then the description


00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:27.740
of when the scenarios when that might happen. So for example, raises invalid factorial error


00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.980
if n is less than zero is the time that that happens.


00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.980
>> Oh, cool.


00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.980
>> Isn't that cool?


00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:33.980
>> Yeah.


00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:40.020
>> Yeah. And finally, John also points out that iCharm has the integration for Google


00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.420
strings somewhere in here.


00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:42.820
Yeah.


00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.780
Uh, for Google doc format and how to set that up.


00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.340
So it'll, it'll automatically auto complete and render Google doc strings.


00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.580
When you say, give me the quick help, I control Q and it'll like, just pop that


00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.340
up as a rendered sort of thing there.


00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.660
So a lot of followup on the doc strings.


00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.380
Awesome.


00:20:59.380 --> 00:20:59.820
Cool.


00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.180
Yeah.


00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.300
And that's all I got for my extras about a joke.


00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:03.940
What do you think?


00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.340
Yeah.


00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:04.660
Ready?


00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.620
I've got your joke and then I want to do a dad joke also after that.


00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.060
Awesome.


00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.700
So this one is a lesson in optimization.


00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.360
Careful what you measure careful what you asked for.


00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:14.660
Right.


00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.360
So there's this picture of two tennis ball containers.


00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.200
You know, those tubes that are vacuum sealed.


00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:20.560
Yeah.


00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.220
One of them is not at all optimized.


00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:29.380
It stores only three tennis balls, but the one to the right says, look, if you cut


00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.720
the tennis balls in half, you can, you can store six tennis balls in this container.


00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.460
Way more efficient use.


00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.660
Yeah.


00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.320
Yeah.


00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.860
I mean, your tennis game might suck, but that's awesome.


00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.540
Yeah.


00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:41.940
Yeah.


00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.840
So there you have it.


00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.400
Yeah.


00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.040
Okay.


00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.700
So over to you to close it out.


00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.940
Uh, I've got a joke that I just, I was reminded of the other day with,


00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.600
at shared with my kid, it's told dad joke.


00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.120
So, have you seen birds fly in a V formation before?


00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:56.700
Sure.


00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.640
Um, have you ever noticed that sometimes that one side is a lot longer than the


00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.940
other, or it's longer than the other?


00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.320
Yeah.


00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.280
Do you know why that is?


00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.200
There's more birds.


00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.780
>> Optimize it. Amazing.


00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.660
>> Anyway. It's terrible.


00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.740
>> I love it. Perfect dad joke.


00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.960
Well, perfect episode as well. Thanks for being here.


00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.340
>> Thank you.


00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.240
>> Thanks everyone for listening.


00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:19.580
>> Yeah.
