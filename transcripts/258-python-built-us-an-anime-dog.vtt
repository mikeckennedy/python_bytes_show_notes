00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.400
This is episode 258 recorded November 10th, 2021. I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.760
And I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.200
And I'm Karen Dalton.


00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.920
Yay.


00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.560
Yay. Welcome, Karen. So good to have you here.


00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.400
It is quite a delight and an honor. I've been a longtime fan,


00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.920
as they say on the radio, long-time listener, first-time caller,


00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.800
of both of your podcasts and books and Slack channels and training.


00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200
And so I'm really excited to be here.


00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.920
Well, thanks for being part of the community and all those ways.


00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.000
And you and I got to meet down at Pi Bay in San Francisco.


00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.960
That was a lot of fun.


00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.460
Yeah.


00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.960
I don't know if Brian knows, I arrived at Pi Bay and I was going to be one of the emcees.


00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.040
And I saw Michael Kennedy, who I cherry picked to introduce.


00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.080
I was one of the organizers and MCs for the event and approached him and overwhelmed him.


00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.480
I'm like, you're a super fan. And he was like, so, but he was very gracious about,


00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.640
about being a fangirled just at the registration table.


00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.000
Yeah, no, you, you were great to help me out with the talk. Thank you so much. And


00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.400
hey, it's Anthony Shaw on the live stream. Hey, says, hi, Karen. Great to have you on the show.


00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.600
Nice. Hi, Anthony.


00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
Anthony and I just did a show on Pigeon, P-Y-J-I-O-N,


00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.800
the JIT compiler that he just released, version 1.0.


00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.680
That talk Python episode will be out today, tomorrow,


00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.360
fingers crossed, very, very soon.


00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.320
So stay tuned for more on that.


00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.240
But let's start with whatever you brought us, Brian.


00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.880
- Well-- - Number one.


00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.040
- Well, I figure we really need to talk about Will McGugan


00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.280
because, you know, get that--


00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.920
- Has it been a show since we've done that?


00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.240
- Yeah.


00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.480
So just get that out of the way.


00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.720
So on Twitter, Will asked a general question to everybody.


00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.320
Something like, if I've got an open source project


00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.400
and somebody files an issue with it,


00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.160
but I have a question about it and I ask them a question


00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.440
and they don't ever respond for a really long time.


00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.680
So is there a way to just automatically clean those up


00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680
or clean them up easily?


00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.040
Because we could just assume that the person has figured out


00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.280
or solved the problem or it's not a problem anymore


00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.300
or they don't care.


00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.780
So one of the responses which I liked,


00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.740
which I thought was pretty cool was a bot, a GitHub bot.


00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.140
It's actually from GitHub.


00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.260
It's a bot called Stale.


00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.980
So it's a bot that closes stale issues and PRs.


00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.980
And the gist of it, like on the 10, it says,


00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.740
it warns and then closes issues and PRs


00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.900
that have had no activity for a specified amount of time.


00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.320
That sounds perfect.


00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.000
configuration must be on the default branch and the default values will be,


00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.360
it will add a stale label to issues or PRs that are


00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.160
after 60 days of inactivity and


00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.640
close stale issues or PRs after seven days of inactivity.


00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.480
If an update or comment occurs during that time frame,


00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.680
it restarts the clock.


00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.520
>> I love it.


00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.960
>> But for me,


00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.100
since I'm an open-source maintainer,


00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.940
but sometimes I don't pay attention to them


00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.040
for a couple of months.


00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.500
I would definitely want to bump that up


00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.820
to make sure that it's at least within my timeframe


00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.160
so that if my own inactivity problems


00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.980
might not be the case.


00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.940
- I totally hear that.


00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.760
I would love to see one minor change,


00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.280
one more bullet point on the things it does.


00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.440
Add a stale label after 60 days,


00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.560
close it after seven days of inactivity.


00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.420
A comment will bring it back.


00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.780
But I would love to see this bot put a comment on there saying,


00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.540
if we don't deal with this, it's going away.


00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.740
That way, the people who submitted the PR will get an email,


00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.820
the maintainer will get an email.


00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.260
And so like you're notified the seven day clock has begun, you know?


00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.540
Karen, you're shaking your head.


00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.540
- Yeah, I mean, I've certainly seen it on open source repos,


00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.740
and it's nice to have that there,


00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.660
but sometimes it's an issue that's important to you,


00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.580
and you don't want it to necessarily go away.


00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.220
Like, and I wish there was a way to like say,


00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.060
this is actually really important to me.


00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.900
Please don't post it,


00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.060
even if you can't pay attention to it.


00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.900
- Yeah.


00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.180
- Well, there's, for instance, in one of the settings,


00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.060
there's a bunch of settings.


00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.540
One of the settings is a stale issue message


00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.780
or comment on stale issue.


00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.500
So it lets you look like it.


00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.860
- I thought about it already.


00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.300
- That one.


00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.820
And I think there's exempt issue labels,


00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.420
labels on issues exempted.


00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.540
So you can mark something as, you know,


00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.660
keep this around or something.


00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.260
- Oh, see, I don't have that window up,


00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.620
so I didn't scroll, perfect.


00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.380
- Yeah, so it looks like it-- - That's what I need.


00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.220
- Looks like it does everything.


00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.000
- Yeah, this looks well thought out then, I love it now.


00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.840
- Yeah, and it's been around for a while,


00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.600
and it's got like, I guess only 498 stars,


00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.240
but it'll be more than that after we do this show.


00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.100
- That's right. - Exactly.


00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.840
- It'll be at least 500.


00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.620
- Yeah, 499. (laughs)


00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.460
- No, this is a great find, I really like it.


00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.660
So yeah, good one, Brian.


00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.320
- Yeah, I think I'm really impressed with GitHub


00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.420
that they've added so many features.


00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.300
I use it more than I have GitLab,


00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.940
so GitLab may have as many, in all fairness,


00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.700
but GitHub has added lots of cool features


00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.660
and ongoing development to make things easier.


00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.180
As many things have evolved, lots more features added,


00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.760
but things like this that make it easier


00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.500
to maintain things.


00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.740
I'm really happy with the way,


00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.100
the direction of GitHub these days.


00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.860
So it seems like it's going really well.


00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.700
- Yeah. - Yeah,


00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.540
I'm definitely happy there.


00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.940
- I use both, I like them both,


00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.420
but GitHub definitely has a focus on the,


00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.680
or at least it feels like it's listening


00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.000
to open source maintainers and their needs.


00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.460
- Yeah, for sure, for sure.


00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.500
All right, so I wanna show you another one


00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.420
that I think also may involve Wilma Googan.


00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.700
I gotta do a quick check here.


00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.540
It is called Jut, Jut, Jut.


00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.460
Maybe if you're German, it's Jut.


00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.540
I don't know, but we could look at the Py Project,


00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.460
Tom will see if Rich is in here.


00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.380
It is, okay, so yeah, it definitely involves


00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.980
Rich and Wilma Guggen.


00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.940
And what it is, is it's a renderer,


00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.760
not a interactive environment,


00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.580
but a renderer for Jupyter Notebooks.


00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.580
And we've had that, you know,


00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.680
in BViewer, things like that, like on the web,


00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.420
but this one is in your terminal.


00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.940
So here's the scenario, like you're in the terminal,


00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.180
remote, maybe SSHed into a remote machine,


00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.740
and you're like, oh, there's this notebook file,


00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.340
but what the heck is this?


00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.660
What is it?


00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.540
I don't have a browser or whatever.


00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.740
And so the way that it works,


00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.980
let me pull up this little animation for everyone


00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.500
and have it go, is if you're somewhere,


00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.700
you just say, I'm gonna go with jute,


00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.440
jute, give it a URL,


00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.580
and you can literally give it something off of the internet,


00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.780
and you can even give it like tail command.


00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.800
So I wanna see the last 10 cells instead of lines,


00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.260
and it uses rich to colorize and style what the notebook has,


00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.800
including the data cells as well as the actual output,


00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.640
the computation, you know how the notebooks


00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.960
will store their output from the last time they were run,


00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.120
unless you clear them, it'll show that as well.


00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.160
What do you all think?


00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.640
- I love that.


00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.880
I mean, sometimes you get a file


00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.520
and you just wanna check some introspect some portion of it


00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.080
and you can't just do more for cat on a Jupyter notebook.


00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.960
- Yeah, you get something completely wrong, yeah.


00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.640
- And I don't, sometimes in the space then you're in,


00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.320
You don't, you just want to quickly be able to check


00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.360
what it is and move on.


00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.720
And so I love that.


00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.880
And I love rich.


00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.420
That's that it's, you know, the color,


00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.720
the colorized terminal is really helpful.


00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.880
- Honestly, it might have better syntax highlighting


00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.820
the notebooks themselves.


00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.520
Brian, what were you gonna say?


00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.440
- No, no, just, I love, I really like the focus


00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.960
on the, of tools making things usable on,


00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.000
on command line because I'm a command line lover.


00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.720
And I mean, I've got nothing against doing notebooks


00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.600
in a web browser, but things like this make it possible


00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.780
to do things like put them in a pipeline


00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.660
and automate them more easily.


00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.340
And like this, it's not really automating using the notebook


00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.120
but it might be, you might make sure that like something


00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.320
is, you know, a regression thing.


00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.100
You wanna make sure that things are visible.


00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.640
So you can use this to grab one off of a repo


00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.680
or something to make sure nothing weird happened.


00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680
- Yeah, for sure.


00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.520
Yeah, it looks good.


00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.080
And to bring it back around full circle,


00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.560
Will McGugan out in the audience says,


00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.640
"Neat, that's a new one for me."


00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.480
Hey, Will.


00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.820
Yeah, it's always fun to show you projects


00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.520
using your library,


00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.120
'cause there's a bunch of cool ones out there.


00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.960
Awesome.


00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.600
All right, well, I'm not sure what else


00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.520
I have to say about this one,


00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.080
other than it was sent in to us by KidPixo.


00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.240
Thank you for that.


00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.480
That was awesome.


00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.320
Keep them coming.


00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.800
He sent a bunch of things along.


00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.700
Like I said, you can display the different cells,


00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.700
like the first five, last five,


00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.780
whatever you wanna pass over.


00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.900
You can also do things like show it to me just in plain text


00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.540
if you for some reason wanna copy it


00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.740
and you don't want the formatting.


00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.180
Pretty straightforward to use, but also really nice.


00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.260
All right, Karen, you're up next.


00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.580
- Adding on to the Jupyter thread,


00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.780
one of the interesting things that's coming out


00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.100
is JupyterLite.


00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.680
It is being developed by core Jupyter developers,


00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.180
but it's still unofficial.


00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.740
And one of the nice things is static.


00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.980
And if you share it with somebody, they can just go to a web page and you can


00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:39.600
just, you can cache it so you don't have to have a Jupyter notebook server running.


00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.620
It's a static page.


00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.200
Obviously there's JavaScript and other elements involved.


00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.260
And so if you just click on one of those links, try it with JupyterLab, it takes


00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.060
you to a browser that window, as you can see, is a static page.


00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.460
It's going to take a second to come up because it's got some JavaScript.


00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.060
And if you click on that pile light and then just do like an import this


00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.140
to see a standard kind of notebook.


00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.460
Yeah, it has a little, it has a notebook tour.


00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.040
If you do an import this, which is a standard kind of test to do the Python


00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.700
mantras, it, you know, it runs simply and that's all just running in a browser.


00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.500
So obviously it's, if you wanted to share things with some somebody, it's,


00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.560
It's an easy way for them to see it.


00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.060
You would just send them that file and they can open it up and do some additional things.


00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:35.660
It's probably you won't want to run your poor data pipelines in a static web browser window,


00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.660
but it does allow you to do a variety of things.


00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.260
There's some sample notebooks included with it that let you do some things.


00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.620
You can run through either step-by-step,


00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.300
that you can actually add text into as you saw into the window.


00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:58.660
So it's a nice feature add to be able to run a notebook in a browser window and show some


00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.260
examples of your code in a static way.


00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.420
I know that people have sent me Jupyter notebooks or shared them or sometimes you can see them


00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.420
on GitHub.


00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:12.060
There's even tools now that you can do Git diffs.


00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.820
There's a service that allows you to do diffs of Jupyter notebooks that you can do that


00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.020
for your pull request reviews.


00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.580
But sometimes it's nice to be able to say like, I would like to change this a little


00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.540
bit without like starting up a server yourself.


00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.580
So yeah, yeah, we've been able to host these, we've been able to set up notebook servers


00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.580
and host them.


00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.980
But there's issues with letting people run code, maybe don't want to let them run it.


00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.060
It's only read only.


00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.340
And so but this is cool, because it will let you run it in the browser, right?


00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.540
Which is using WebAssembly.


00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.700
Yeah, exactly.


00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.780
They, you can have the JupyterLab look or kind of retro look,


00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.340
which is just very minimalist without that kind of UI.


00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.860
So it's, it's a really nice feature.


00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.540
I've never tried retro lab.


00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.200
Yeah.


00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.860
It's just more of a basic like file list.


00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.740
It doesn't have that.


00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:04.180
Um, it doesn't have that nice kind of look and feel of the, the newer version


00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.260
of JupyterLab, but it works.


00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:06.860
Yeah.


00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.500
Fantastic.


00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.980
Just run all the cells and it runs, I guess, in WebAssembly.


00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.620
Super cool.


00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.060
Oh yeah, that's a good one.


00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.820
Brian, what do you think?


00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:20.020
A simple pip install and then you run another command


00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.420
to generate all the JavaScript and things it needs.


00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.300
And then once that index file is made, that directory is made,


00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.020
then it's really easy.


00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.820
You just open up that index.html on your...


00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.620
You can run it on localhost, you can Python start at


00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.100
HTTP server easily with Python 3,


00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.220
so that it will serve that page as well.


00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:47.680
You can even deploy it to GitHub pages or something like Netlify or some other static host.


00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.180
Yeah.


00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:48.980
Pretty sweet.


00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.680
I definitely think, I agree that you don't want to do big heavy workloads on this,


00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.280
but especially for graphing and interactive stuff and just like tweaking the data a little bit,


00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.080
I think this is amazing to be able to, especially for reports and things.


00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.880
There's a lot of places where this is useful.


00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.620
Yep. And you have no security issues or worried about people running code or messing with it,


00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.980
because whatever they do, they're doing this themselves.


00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.820
- Exactly.


00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.140
- Right, there's still little Bobby Tables issues


00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.060
that you have to worry about


00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.860
with a static web browser on your site.


00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.860
- Yeah, you definitely wanna lower your surface area there.


00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.980
All right, Brian, a bit of an intermission.


00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.020
- Yeah, let's talk about our sponsor today.


00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.260
So today's sponsor is Shortcut,


00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.460
which is formerly Clubhouse.


00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.340
And thank you for sponsoring the episode.


00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.220
There are a lot of project management tools out there


00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.220
and I've used a ton of them,


00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.200
but most suffer from a few common problems.


00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.460
They're either too complex and it's hard to get started


00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.540
and there's all tons of options all the time


00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.020
make you confused, or they're too simple


00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.260
and you really, you can get started on one project


00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.500
but you can't use it for multiple projects and stuff.


00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.640
Or they seem to be like geared towards managers


00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.260
but difficult for engineers or geared towards engineers


00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.140
and difficult for managers.


00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.860
I think shortcut is different.


00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.780
So Shortcut is built for software teams


00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.740
and based on making workflows easy, which I like.


00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.780
So let's say you have a big scale objectives,


00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.260
goals and roadmaps, topics in those and items in those,


00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.700
big goals and roadmaps can easily be tied to teams


00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.740
and individual work sprints and progress on those


00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.340
can be easily flow back into reports at the top level.


00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.380
It's keyboard friendly,


00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.620
so you can hook up short codes and stuff.


00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.300
So you don't, the UI is intuitive


00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.560
and it's pretty easy to use,


00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.500
but the things you do every day,


00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.460
you can tie those to keyboard shortcuts


00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.080
and make them even faster.


00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.660
And it has tight VCS integration.


00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.120
So you can update your task progress


00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.360
by just adding a comment or a little key code


00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.360
into your commit or PR and it flows back upstream.


00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.660
This is really cool.


00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.700
Iteration planning is also a breeze.


00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.500
You can see your team activity when you need it,


00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.560
but you can see your own work really easily


00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.780
when you need that too.


00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.140
and burden down charts and cycle time


00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.940
and lead time charts are just built in for you.


00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.260
It's really, really great to see all that.


00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.880
So finally, a project management tool


00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.340
for both engineers and managers.


00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.140
Give it a try at shortcut.com/pythonbytes.


00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.460
- Awesome, thanks Shortcut.


00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.340
Hey, Brian, before we move on to your next item,


00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.740
that Jupiter Lite was sent in by Marcel Millicent.


00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.220
So thank you, Marcel, for sending that over.


00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.180
- Yeah, nice.


00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.420
- Yeah, we always appreciate


00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.860
when our listeners help us do our research


00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.860
'cause they have all these ideas


00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.740
that we don't know about.


00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.580
- Yeah.


00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.980
- Yeah, thanks for picking that up.


00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.820
- For sure.


00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.700
- Yeah, of course.


00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.820
- Well, ACK, ACK now, supplies are limited.


00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.180
No, I don't actually use that.


00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.980
- But wait, you get more.


00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.340
- Yeah, I wanna talk about grep a little bit.


00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.340
I use grep all the time for finding stuff


00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.060
within my codes, command line tool


00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.300
for finding stuff in files.


00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.540
And I'm not gonna cover it in the show,


00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.100
but I threw in in the show notes,


00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.860
if you don't use grep or tools like grep,


00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.940
I threw in a couple of examples in the show notes


00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.640
to get you started real easily.


00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.880
It's a, I think it's useful to find stuff.


00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.620
One question I did have is like,


00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.780
I've got a command sequence in the show notes


00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.740
that I'd like to have people take a look at.


00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.900
I don't have a screenshot for it,


00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.900
but if I want to find like say foo in recursively


00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.800
in all the folders and directories, I can do that easily.


00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.920
and I wanna try to eliminate a directory,


00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.520
like don't look in my virtual environment folder.


00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.760
I've got a weird thing about using just grep


00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.280
and then piping it to another grep.


00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.960
I don't know how to do it easier, so please help me out.


00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.360
But anyway, this article I'd like to point to


00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.000
is called Feature Comparison of ACK,


00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.640
Silver Surfer, Git grep, GNU grep, and Rip grep.


00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.000
And this is actually really cool.


00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
So it's put out by the ACK people themselves


00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.040
at beyondgrep.com.


00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.200
ACK is a kind of a grep alternative that's written in Perl.


00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.880
But this comparison chart says,


00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.980
we need more comparison charts like this.


00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.980
And it compares all these different alternatives to grep.


00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.640
Silver surfer, silver searcher, sorry, is AG.


00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.920
AG for silver, it's kind of clever.


00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.240
But the chart talks--


00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.920
from the chemical symbol table.


00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.640
- Yeah, and also kind of a play on Silver Surfer,


00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.280
the superhero as well.


00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.280
So the chart shows like kind of a whole bunch of stuff


00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.760
about all these tools,


00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.320
like what languages are written in.


00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.920
Most of them are in C, but ACK is in Perl


00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.460
and RG or Rip Grip is in Rust.


00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.760
So that kind of intrigues me.


00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.020
I've been enjoying some Rust tools lately,


00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.440
but it goes through a whole bunch of features.


00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.100
So I didn't really know that these were all that different.


00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.780
So if you're gonna try something new,


00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.300
it's kind of nice to see if the thing


00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.680
that you really need qualifies.


00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.900
And it's got some high level features,


00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.580
but then also dives into like specifics,


00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.160
like if you have specific pattern matching needs


00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.560
or output needs, but kind of a cool tool


00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.260
to decide which grep alternative to use.


00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.820
- It's cool, I'd never heard of get grep.


00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.300
That'll let you grep, but against a get repo?


00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.700
- I don't know.


00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.400
- It says up at the top that it lets you search


00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.140
a get repository by default,


00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.140
of like search where, right at the bottom of your screen there.


00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.860
>> Oh, yeah.


00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.100
So that was pretty.


00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.180
>> It's interesting.


00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.020
>> Repo by default.


00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.180
Nice. >> And search your git history.


00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.260
That sounds useful.


00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.500
>> Yeah, let's try that out too.


00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.020
This is cool.


00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:42.780
>> Exactly.


00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.300
That's going to make me learn grep.


00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.540
>> But actually, so one of the things I do appreciate is if people that write


00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.100
tool, like little tools that are alternatives to something else, often they


00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.580
do look at the landscape to find out what else is out there and try things out.


00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.980
So actually, one of the reasons I'm highlighting is this,


00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.380
is I agree with the author that says,


00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.220
we need more of these.


00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.740
Take that research you've done and actually publish it.


00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.220
Because sometimes one of these tool authors


00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.260
is one of the best people to compare


00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.660
all the different alternatives.


00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.060
So, sweet. - Yeah.


00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:15.900
This is cool.


00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.720
Nice one.


00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.440
I don't use grep nearly as much as I should,


00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.540
or hardly at all, but it seems very useful in this Git.


00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.700
Like I said, this Git one might make me learn grep.


00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.220
Karen, do you do anything with grep?


00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.220
No, it's all good.


00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.820
We're happy to have your puppy on the show as well.


00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.620
Yeah, featuring a five-month-old golden retriever.


00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.720
It's very vocal.


00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.220
Yeah, I love Silver Searcher.


00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.020
I think it's really super fast.


00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.920
If you're, that's my favorite of these.


00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:48.320
A long time ago, I started programming in my backgrounds in molecular biology.


00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.320
I started in academic publishing, putting academic journals online.


00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.220
And so Pearl is, you know, close to my heart.


00:19:54.220 --> 00:20:00.460
But I'm surprised that, you know, like these Perl tools that are still around,


00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.060
they still work perfectly fine.


00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:07.060
I learned a lot of Perl compatible regular expression use, you know, that PCREs.


00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:13.580
And I remember asking some years ago, you know, in another language, they had PCRE regular expression.


00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.860
They're like, what's PCRE?


00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.660
You know, it's Perl compatible regular expression.


00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.820
So, but AG is great.


00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:26.860
I think in my world a lot of people are submitting data and sometimes you're looking for bets and places and things and


00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.500
Uh, so these kinds of tools are really helpful. I use


00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.900
Grep mostly because that's you know, it's easy to pipe it to something else


00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:41.980
But ag is great great because it colorizes your results without passing a color flag, which is usually more convenient


00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.220
there's a little bit different syntax, so


00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.860
uh, so


00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.620
But I haven't used some of these other ones.


00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.320
So this is cool to know about.


00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:50.820
Yeah.


00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.120
It's always good to learn about more.


00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.360
Maybe I'll try all of them just for the heck of it.


00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:54.760
Nice.


00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.200
Yeah.


00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:55.600
All right.


00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.060
I want to talk about Airtable real quick.


00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.800
So Airtable is like Excel, but it kind of has a database backend.


00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.400
It's also got like a Trello aspect to it.


00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.560
So I don't know if people are using Airtable for things.


00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.820
It also has kind of a Gantt chart or a project management thing.


00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.060
I don't exactly want to talk about Airtable, but I want to set the stage.


00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.940
I want to talk about PyAirtable.


00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:22.440
So I just had Gui, the maintainer of this on the on-talk Python,


00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.660
to talk about Python and architecture and what they were doing,


00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.020
where he was working was a lot of things were backed by Airtable.


00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.740
So PyAirtable is this API to talk to it through Python,


00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.860
which is pretty interesting already.


00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.740
But then if you look a little bit more on the docs, it's got,


00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.620
where's the right spot to go look?


00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.060
There is under the API,


00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.220
somewhere in here there's an ORM aspect as well.


00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.900
So you can even use Airtable like an ORM where you create


00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.900
classes that map to the stuff you're doing over there and do


00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.940
select statements against it and delete them and whatnot.


00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.940
So if people are doing stuff with Airtable,


00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.900
here's a pretty awesome way to automate it. What do you think?


00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.500
>> I think it's great. Is it done by the same people or?


00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.580
No, no, it's done by a guy named Gwee.


00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.240
Last name, I'm gonna look, sorry Gwee.


00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:21.200
- I just think it's pretty cool to have,


00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.420
oh, nice name, Gwee.


00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:27.300
- Yeah, Tala Rico, yeah, Gwee Tala Rico.


00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.980
And he's also in San Francisco,


00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.060
so he's one of your extended neighbors, Karen.


00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.700
- Yeah, the Bay Area is big.


00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.220
- Yeah, he was also at Pi Bay.


00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.560
Yeah, well, there was a lot of people at mass.


00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.100
So even people that are in my community,


00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.880
I'm a co-organizer for a Bay area Python interest group


00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.980
or the longest running Python groups.


00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.900
Obviously I didn't start it,


00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.300
but I recently started helping out.


00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.980
And even people that I'm in meetings with every month


00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.740
and for a number of years,


00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.420
they'd have to say like, oh, Karen,


00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.980
and even with badges on.


00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.980
So I, I, I'm, you try to like spy people or, you know,


00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.820
based on their silhouette, if that's the right person.


00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.660
So.


00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.480
- Yeah.


00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.780
And it was outside, so a lot of people had sunglasses


00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.620
or a hat.


00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.420
Yeah, it was, it was tricky, but yeah.


00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.580
So he was there.


00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.760
So yeah, he maintains this,


00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.620
but it's sort of endorsed by the Airtable folks.


00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.360
It's like listed as one of the independent things


00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.460
that they might recommend for people doing Python.


00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.300
So.


00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.140
- Yeah.


00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.380
I think it's great to have a Python APIs


00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:41.740
for a lot of services that have a Python client to help support them.


00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.600
It's really helpful that whether it's written by the company or somebody else.


00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.020
And sometimes it's really helpful if you're a small team as the kinds of teams, I'm in


00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:55.480
a research community, we have small teams to be able to look at the tests, look at their


00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.340
code to see how to use it.


00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:02.040
Sometimes the company's documentation is not great on how to use their API.


00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.800
sometimes these extra Python components help you understand their API a little better and


00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.820
what you can do with their API. Some companies are better than others in documenting their


00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:18.480
own APIs to be able to interact with this. But I know that people use Airtable for a


00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:24.120
variety of different things and use things like Zapier to connect it to, you know, it's


00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:29.880
like a Rube Goldberg kind of like stitching together all these kinds of services to do,


00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.980
of a thing at the end, like make toast.


00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.780
- Yeah, yeah, 'cause you wanna let the business people


00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.980
still just use Airtable, but you need other things


00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.820
to happen or something like that, right?


00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.900
Right, so when they insert this,


00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.420
it's going to heat up that thing, which knock over a cup,


00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.900
which will then trigger an API, like that kind of thing?


00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.620
- Yeah, yeah, or send a meeting invite, so.


00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.460
- Or exactly.


00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.920
- One of the things I like is if,


00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.460
like a company that's using one of these tools,


00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.980
having a Python API allows individual hackers like me


00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.820
to be able to just say, how do I find just the stuff I need to care about?


00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.980
And I can write my own little application just to pull out the bits that I need to care about


00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.860
and do it on the command line and probably use rich if I doing that.


00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.020
And I only see grep grep air table for things to do.


00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.420
Assign.


00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.220
Exactly.


00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:17.860
Yeah.


00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.460
No, yeah, I've actually done that.


00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.860
You can search within GitHub itself or sometimes I'll clone it and kind of


00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:31.060
offer some keywords that might help me figure out what I need to do a little bit faster.


00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:36.160
Yeah, yeah, for sure. And Neil Heather out there, just giving a quick shout out to Bay


00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:41.500
Piggies, the meetup group out there. Awesome. Very, very cool. All right.


00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:46.300
We have, we're pretty fortunate in the Bay Area that we have several different, from


00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.620
all the way from down in Santa Cruz. So for people who don't know that, you know, the


00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:54.500
Bay area is, or depending on how you're looking at it, you know, the San Francisco


00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.200
Bay and, and, and there's meetup groups and Python groups all along.


00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.860
And we're kind of a mid to South peninsula.


00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:08.060
Um, there's all the way from up Santa Cruz to up to, SF Python, which runs PI Bay,


00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.580
uh, Grace law, and there's other ones in the North Bay.


00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.660
So we're pretty fortunate to have a lot of, really rich, strong Python community.


00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.660
Yeah.


00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.220
local stuff going on there for sure, which is no surprise in San Francisco.


00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.520
But it's also necessary because even though things are close together,


00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.120
you can't get there from here.


00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.320
Usually they're separated far by time, if not.


00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.060
Yeah, perhaps the traffic has started to pick up again for sure.


00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.320
Yeah, same here.


00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.120
All right, Karen, you want to do our last item here?


00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.120
Touch one more time on some notebook things.


00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.060
Yeah. One of the the ways if you're part of a team,


00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.120
Everyone probably knows about the black formatter that helps you


00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:54.840
Make opinionated decisions or it makes opinionated decisions for you about how things should be formatted


00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.500
So your your team's a little bit more streamlined


00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.860
and now marco gorelli


00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:10.040
Has who is a creator of a package called nbqa for notebook qa that did things like eyesore and other things


00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.680
Has added into black the black formatter itself


00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:21.880
um an ability to do black formatting on notebooks, which is great because then it's part of the core package and


00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.880
Support will be even richer. very powerful


00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:32.600
So you can just run once you've once you've installed it it there's a command there shown on the screen pip install black


00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:40.120
That you can run black on a like notebook, you know


00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.940
- Yeah, there's probably some hotkey or something


00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.640
like within Jupyter itself, right?


00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.620
- Say that again?


00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.300
- There's probably like some kind of little icon


00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.300
or hotkey or something in there automatically, right?


00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.660
I would guess.


00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.620
- I don't know.


00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.320
I've run it on the command line


00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.760
and the instructions have it run on a command line.


00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.460
I don't know if you can run it on itself.


00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.640
It'd be like, you know, modifying an array


00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.900
that you're iterating over.


00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:06.740
I don't know if it--


00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.020
- Oh, no, I guess I have it backwards, right?


00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:08.860
'Cause this is actually--


00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.980
- Yeah, this is actually going into black,


00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.820
not into Jupyter, right?


00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.660
So yeah, so it's more from the black side, got it.


00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.500
- Yeah, you're running it against a notebook


00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.900
to apply black formatting to the notebook itself.


00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.940
- Yeah, but at this point,


00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.620
how long until somebody puts a button


00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.540
into Jupyter to do this?


00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.300
- Yeah, I imagine that certainly can happen.


00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.860
I think that you have, like in VS Code,


00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.260
you already can apply black or other kinds


00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.000
with F8 formatting within something.


00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.360
So I imagine that totally makes sense


00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.440
that you'd be able to apply it.


00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.680
But I guess I think about it in that sense.


00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.000
It's not the notebook itself that's applying


00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.720
that standardization, it's a package running


00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.360
against whatever kind of thing that you're using,


00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.640
whether it's PyCharm or VS Code or some other tool.


00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.080
So I still think it's running against it


00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.480
rather than the notebook itself changing itself,


00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.160
like spinning around like Wonder Woman


00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:08.120
coming up super sorted. I sort, you know, package import.


00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:13.240
Absolutely. Yeah, this is cool. I really like this. I've always thought that the notebooks


00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.200
lacked a little bit of coding assistance.


00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.720
Standardization too.


00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.920
Yeah. Yeah. And also black brings that right. But I felt like, you know, if you type a thing dot,


00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.920
it doesn't pull up any autocomplete. You have to do the research to know, well,


00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.240
well, now I have to proactively hit tab


00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.340
to trigger an auto-complete and also formatting


00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.140
is not just a hotkey for format my code


00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.300
or command palette thing to format my code as easily.


00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.860
- Yeah, I imagine that,


00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.380
we're lucky that the Jupyter community is really rich


00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.340
and people are committed to it and enhancing on it.


00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.620
I know that there's other kinds of notebook systems


00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.620
that are being developed by places like Netflix


00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.700
where they're like, what is the bare bones we can do


00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.700
that our data scientists can run something else.


00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.200
But the Jupyter notebook community is really extensively used.


00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.500
The community is very active.


00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:10.500
So I'm glad that things like this are being added to enhance its usability


00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:17.400
and readability and standardize it in an easier way for everyone.


00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.500
Yeah, absolutely.


00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.200
Well done, Marco.


00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.000
All right, Brian.


00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.200
I think that brings us to the extras.


00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.900
Extras.


00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.600
Yeah.


00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.400
You got any extras you want to throw out there?


00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.400
- No, I just, I'm not gonna like put a link or anything,


00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.820
but I just wanted to comment.


00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.560
Some of the times I've been giggling today


00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.820
is because Anthony Shaw's on the show


00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.320
and we talked about Pigeon briefly.


00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.720
And every time I hear about Pigeon,


00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.600
I think of the Burton Ernie skit with doing the pigeon.


00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.000
I don't know if anybody else remembers that,


00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.520
but anyway, that's my quick extra.


00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.360
- Hang on.


00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.580
I know that Anthony Shaw likes to run VS Code pets.


00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:57.900
>> Yeah.


00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.140
>> Are you sure that's right? I think I saw one of that.


00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.140
>> I wonder if there's a pigeon in this pet thing.


00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.580
>> Yes, maybe it could come full circle and it could be some kind of pigeon in the pets.


00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.900
>> In the pets, VS Code pets.


00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.620
>> Like below the project settings, that'd be fantastic.


00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.380
>> What are these pets that you're talking about?


00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.340
>> Let me see if I can find it. Let's see if I can see VS Code pets.


00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.660
Yeah, I don't have a link.


00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.100
I don't do that much VS Code,


00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.740
so I don't know all that much.


00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.700
But what it is, is it will literally put like a little animated animal in your editor.


00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.900
And it can be simple like this.


00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:32.300
This is like a cat that's crawling along like a git diff section.


00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.800
Or they can be way more complicated.


00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.800
Like here, like see this one, for example.


00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.740
There's like a castle and there's a cat that lives in the end.


00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:43.700
Alas, Anthony Shaw says, but there is no pigeon on the pets extension.


00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.840
There's a lot of stuff happening.


00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.920
Like here, here we go.


00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.400
There's like a hunting cat in the forest


00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.720
and all kinds of things.


00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:56.000
So, and Chris May out in the live stream says,


00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.840
"Yet, there's no pigeon in the fight yet."


00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.040
- Yeah, well, pull request accepted.


00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.520
- Exactly, exactly.


00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.520
Who's gonna be adding this?


00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.200
Anyway, this is how we should bring it around,


00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.280
full circle, Brian.


00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.840
- Well, do you have any extras?


00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.280
- I do, but I always have them.


00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.760
So let me ask Karen if she has anything


00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.440
she wants to add or throw out while we're here.


00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.080
- Yeah, well, it's a general thing.


00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.000
I just helped out at Pi Bay.


00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.040
I help out at Bay Piggies.


00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:25.760
And, I just want to off just tell people, whatever, wherever your


00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.720
community is, they're always looking for lightning talks.


00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.120
It's good practice.


00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.480
Uh, it's as, as both of, you know, Michael and Brian that, you know,


00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.940
coming up with show ideas or, you know, meetup talks and finding speakers is a


00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:47.540
challenge. And so, you know, offering something that you want to talk about is good practice,


00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:51.700
and the people in the communities around you are really supportive and welcoming.


00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:57.380
And a lightning talk is great practice. It gets you feedback. And I know that for somebody who's


00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:03.620
who talked at at Bay Piggies, and also for some of the speakers at Pi Bay, you know, I've been


00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:08.340
willing to work with them on their slides and talk to them how to give the talk and everything


00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:15.540
To it's it's great practice both, you know professionally and then you have a recording of what you talked about. So, um


00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:20.920
Tribute you contribute in code or you can contribute in ideas and experience


00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:28.100
In your learning journey, even if you're just starting out talking about that journey is really helpful talking about a new package that came out


00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:32.580
and and you guys are doing a fantastic job bringing things up to date, but maybe


00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:37.700
You know in these other communities people can do that. I just want to just open it up


00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:45.060
It's not just the experts who are contributing at people at every level in your local meetups can can give a talk and


00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:53.140
It's good experience. It's good for you. It's good for them. And so i'm just going to encourage everybody to volunteer in your python community


00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.020
Yeah, absolutely


00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:59.140
And if you're thinking about doing like submitting a talk to say pycon or another big conference doing it locally


00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.580
At your local meetup with people, you know with just 10 people


00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:09.020
It's a really good way to practice that and get a sense for what it's going to be like if you do get accepted and hone it a little bit.


00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.420
Yeah, great feedback and great questions too.


00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.980
So yeah, perfect prep.


00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.520
Great.


00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:13.980
Yep.


00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.680
All right.


00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.460
My Apple watch wants me to stand up, but instead I'm going to talk about some extras.


00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:24.120
So first one is I've been playing around with a new password manager.


00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.180
I use one password.


00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.360
I love one password.


00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.460
I use it on all my things, but I've decided that there are certain things I would like to put on the systems.


00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:36.900
I don't want to set up my super important passwords on or I want to share with people and so on.


00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.540
I was like, all right, well, what else could I use?


00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:47.860
So I came across a Bitwarden, which is an open source password manager that also has like a cloud backend and mobile apps and all sorts of stuff, browser integration.


00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:56.180
So instead of just running a local encrypted file or something, this is a really good option from what I can tell for setting up.


00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.660
It does, it does have a paid plan if you want.


00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:04.460
But if you look at the paid plan, the paid personal plan, it's like $10 a year,


00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.940
you know, like 80 cents a month or something.


00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:11.300
So it's it's totally doable as for only 80 cents a month.


00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.140
You too could be secure.


00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.060
Exactly.


00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.540
For the coffee that you spilled on yourself, the price of that you could have.


00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.140
I like this because actually just I know you have a bunch of other stuff,


00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:25.060
but it's driving me kind of nuts that even like five or ten dollars a month


00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.800
or twenty dollars a month for some things.


00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.500
everything is going towards these subscription plans.


00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.040
And it's like, it's just storing my password.


00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.440
I don't want to pay $20 a month.


00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.440
So, yep.


00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.100
This also has a self-hosted version, I believe, because it's open source.


00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.500
You could run it at your company if that was that the kind of thing you wanted to do.


00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.500
So anyway, cool.


00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.280
Good recommendation.


00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.400
I think this is a pretty neat option.


00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.780
Again, I'm still using one password for my personal main stuff, but this is like my,


00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.040
I want another one that doesn't hold all that stuff.


00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.040
And it's, it's pretty neat.


00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.680
Also, Chris may, I'll give you a shout out for high RVA for the Virginia meetup.


00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.680
is also looking for speakers.


00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.180
Because Chris, as Karen, and as we know,


00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.380
booking people to come for this kind of stuff is never easy.


00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.580
Lightning talks, long talks, whatever, you know,


00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.980
there's lots of options.


00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.580
Show up and help us out.


00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.180
All right, so Bitwarden, check it out.


00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.880
Seems cool, open source bonus as well.


00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.680
This one is both a joke and a real thing.


00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.980
Okay, so I love it that it all comes together for Python.


00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.880
So Patrick Mason, synonymous, said


00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.840
The @PSF is on Twitter.


00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.840
The @PSF is searching for an executive director.


00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.840
So Iwa has been the executive director for 10 years.


00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.000
Thank you so much for that.


00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.240
She's finally retiring or moving on, I suppose.


00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.960
And so they're looking for a new person,


00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.720
but that's the real part.


00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.000
So if you want to apply for that, that'd be excellent.


00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.820
The joke is the @PSF is actually


00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.920
the Pacific Salmon Foundation.


00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.960
(both laughing)


00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.920
So they said-


00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.960
- You wanna swim upstream.


00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.360
- Exactly, but here's the thing that's funny is


00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.640
the Salmon Foundation replied saying,


00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.440
@thepsf is looking for an executive director.


00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.180
@justpsf without the the is not currently looking for one.


00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.560
Cheers on a successful search.


00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.640
So Patrick come back and says, sorry for the confusion.


00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.320
The Salmon Foundation says, it happens.


00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.080
We're starting to feel like @thepsf family.


00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.800
It's not like @java ever calls us, broken heart.


00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.040
(laughing)


00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.340
(laughing)


00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.460
- Isn't that fantastic?


00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.720
- Yeah, that's great.


00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.640
Yeah. - Yeah.


00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.520
- Good sense of humor.


00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.840
Now I kinda wanna give to the Salmon Foundation


00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.080
just for being cool people. - I know, I do too.


00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.520
All right, I got a quick pull up


00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.800
a little bit extra for this one.


00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.500
So, Kieran, this will relate to you as well.


00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.440
So there's this thing called


00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.480
the Anime Gan V2 Face Portrait thing


00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.640
that will take a picture that you put up here


00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.680
and it will turn it into anime


00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.640
in like some really wild looking ways.


00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.480
- Oh, wow.


00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.800
- Isn't this crazy?


00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.640
- Yeah, I wanna anime me.


00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.600
- So you can take a picture and throw it up here


00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.840
and get these, they're not very anime.


00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.300
Like I don't think there's exaggerated as anime often is,


00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.960
but you put a picture up here.


00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.800
Doesn't work very well for me with glasses,


00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.240
but I did put up here a picture of my dog.


00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.520
So there's a picture of my dog,


00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.320
which I'll try to link to this in the show notes


00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.160
or something.


00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.480
- What kind of dog is that?


00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.840
That is a carrier mix of like 10 different things.


00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.200
It's very, very sweet, but I can't really give it a type.


00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.120
But if you turn it into anime, it looks like this,


00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.520
which is pretty awesome.


00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:33.660
- Well, I think it should have some kind of battle sword


00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.840
or a helmet.


00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.680
I feel like-


00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.760
- Yeah, it's just way too chill, this dog.


00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.520
It needs to be much more ready to go in battle.


00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.480
So anyway. - With a slowly forming tear.


00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.960
- Exactly. - Go back to the other,


00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.160
the anime, the other spot. - The humans?


00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.240
- Yeah, so it looks like there's a movie.


00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.080
Can you have real time? - Yeah, I don't know


00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.960
what this movie, I couldn't make it move.


00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.280
Maybe if you drop a movie or something up there.


00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.120
There's like an Elon Musk, you know, Bill Gates anime.


00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.680
- So I was hoping that you could do real time filters


00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.160
so we could possibly do our YouTube all in anime sometime.


00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.920
- Oh my gosh, if we could do an episode


00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.560
like once a year where we're in anime,


00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.640
that would be fantastic.


00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:14.640
I would be all about it.


00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.280
Yeah, they've got Tim Apple there.


00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.280
- Or a Snapchat filter, you know, I'm really on bites.


00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.080
I'm not a cat.


00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:23.920
- Exactly.


00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.080
Your honor, I'm not a cat.


00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.300
I'm ready to proceed.


00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.280
- Maybe we could ask StreamYard to update that


00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.260
in our new update.


00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.920
- Oh yeah, that would be fantastic.


00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.760
All right.


00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.800
And then finally, a couple of versions of Python are out.


00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.760
The interesting one is 3.11 alpha 2


00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.120
is now available for people to download.


00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.160
We've spoken about Mark Shannon's plan


00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.840
to make Python faster.


00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.600
Guido van Rossum has been helping over the last year.


00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.440
And I actually interviewed them.


00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.280
- Talk Python.


00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.600
- Yeah, I interviewed them on Talk Python.


00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.960
- Cross, go listen to it.


00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.880
- Yeah, I recently had, at the moment,


00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.000
the most recent episode on Talk Python to me


00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.660
is Guido and Mark talking about the work they're doing


00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.960
to make Python five times faster.


00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.840
This is the first release that has some of those features


00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.400
in it, and you can test to see if this is any faster


00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.240
on your code.


00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.920
So they said they'd love people to try it out.


00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.580
So a double shout out there to that.


00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.540
All right, I think that's enough time for a joke.


00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.760
Although I feel like the salmon one


00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.180
is really kind of also a joke,


00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.020
but it was also real.


00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.120
Like if you're looking for a job within the PSF,


00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.060
the PSF, not just PSF, check it out.


00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.860
All right, but as somebody who does testing, Brian,


00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.620
I'm hoping this one touches your heart a little bit.


00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.460
You ready?


00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.280
- Yeah.


00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.120
- So here's a picture.


00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.460
It's a meme type of picture and it has some text on it.


00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.940
It says, "Hot fix in production."


00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.420
Could you describe that for our audience, please?


00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.300
This is an awesome picture.


00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.100
So you've got like a drainage pipe coming out in the water


00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.220
and it's clearly not attached to,


00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.500
there's, and then it kind of,


00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.140
it's coming out at an angle,


00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.580
then going down, the pipe goes down, straight down.


00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.300
- It's supposed to be connected as one big pipe,


00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.140
but apparently not. - Yeah, it's supposed


00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.500
to be connected, but it's not.


00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.120
But actually there's a hole in the lower pipe,


00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.660
so the upper pipe actually just directly hit,


00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.820
it all works.


00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.860
- The broken pipe on top is being poured


00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.920
into a broken pipe, a hole in a broken pipe


00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.320
that is disconnected.


00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.420
So it works.


00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.020
- Yeah, so it's a hot fix in production.


00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.300
Just make it work.


00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.380
- I'm guessing somebody like just noticed the break


00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.060
and then just popped a hole in the pipe


00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.380
in the bottom to fix it.


00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.520
- Something like that.


00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.100
- Yeah, this is great.


00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.660
- I feel like this is that rush to get that broken website,


00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.440
the website is down type of thing,


00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.540
running as fast as possible.


00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.380
- Well, yeah.


00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.200
- Or it could be Facebook


00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.960
whole internal network can be broken and you have to break out like a saw to saw


00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.320
open the data center door because the network is required to open the door,


00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.680
but the network is down and you've got to get in the door to restore the


00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.120
network.


00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.680
Well, actually, you know, some stuff like this happens all the time because


00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.480
you've got like a team that finds a problem, but the problem isn't in their


00:41:59.480 --> 00:41:59.760
code.


00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:04.520
It's in like some other component that happens to be written by the team in


00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.200
Germany that's on vacation because it's one of their million big holidays.


00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.560
And so you just fix it in the other layer


00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.400
or something like that.


00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.280
So, yeah.


00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.120
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:14.940
It's awesome.


00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.280
All right, we got a little audience participation


00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.120
in this joke.


00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.360
Anthony Shaw says, "Integration tests pass."


00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.200
- Exactly.


00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.360
- And Wilma Coogan says, "Leaky abstractions."


00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.200
- Oh, nice.


00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.040
Well done.


00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.680
- Yeah, well done, you all out there.


00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.600
And well done to you, Karen, as well.


00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.640
Thanks for being here.


00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.200
- I'm super excited.


00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.000
I've been a longtime fan of both of your work.


00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.120
And that--


00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:37.960
- Oh, thanks.


00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:43.880
just thank you for letting me be here. And thank you for inviting me after I super fangirled you


00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:51.480
at PyBay. Because I appreciate both of your work. Everybody should also help out these two wonderful


00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:59.800
podcasts, Talk Python, and the Python Testing Podcast, and Python Bytes on Patreon, as I have


00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:04.120
for a number of years. So super excited to be here. Thank you so much for the invite.


00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:07.080
Yeah, it's great to have you here. Thanks again. Brian, thanks as always.


00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:07.560
Bye.


00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.440
See you all later.
