00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.


00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.600
This is episode 314, recorded December 13th, 2022. I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.720
And I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.240
And it's just us this time. Very nice to be together to share some fun Python news.


00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.520
Yeah, we got some good stuff.


00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.720
I think we do. Why don't you kick it off? Before you do actually real quick,


00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.840
I just want to say thank you to Microsoft for startups for sponsoring this show.


00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.040
Tell you more about them later. Go.


00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.560
>> Nice. Well, first up,


00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.080
we've got something from Will McGugan.


00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.240
Surprise, surprise.


00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.760
But he's got this cool project called Factory,


00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.840
F-A-Q-T-O-R-Y, Factory, cute joke.


00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.420
But it's a tool to generate F-A-Q page,


00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.200
markdown page specifically for GitHub project or something.


00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.160
I mean, you could use it for anything really.


00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.720
But one of the fun things about it is it uses it


00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.000
itself. So you can, I mean, not it, there's an example there, but the questions are fun. So


00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.880
the idea is, is you've got a lot of questions maybe that come in about your project and you


00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.360
want to answer, you know, keep track of them. So what you do is you stick, you stick your questions


00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.400
in a question directory and then, and then they're, they're like just these little markdown


00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.520
snippets and let's look at the raw format.


00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.700
It's just like this title.


00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.620
There's a title block and that's the question,


00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.720
and then maybe some information you can cite things maybe.


00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.340
It's really pretty easy.


00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.340
I'm going to go actually to the read me again to talk about that.


00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.300
>> You're not going to go to the FAQ?


00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.860
>> Yeah, we could.


00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.340
>> I'm just kidding.


00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.100
>> I wanted to make sure that we talked about alt titles.


00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.660
So you have a title for a question and then an alt title,


00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.860
maybe for different kinds of questions


00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.060
that are really the same question, and then an answer.


00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.860
That's the simple form of what to do


00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.480
in these little markdown files, these little question files.


00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.060
And then you just use do factory build.


00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.940
And what it does is takes all those


00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.940
and creates a markdown page.


00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.760
And then you can see what it looks like


00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.440
on the faq.md in this project.


00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.280
But it's nice.


00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.400
got frequently asked questions at the top.


00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.360
It's got links to all the questions,


00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.920
and then you go down and you can see what the answer is.


00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.160
>> Yeah, even like a table of contents with the hash,


00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.080
the hash inner page navigation


00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.120
within GitHub which is interesting, right?


00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.040
>> Yeah, it is interesting and links to each question.


00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.160
So if you want to email somebody a link to it,


00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.360
you can link to the question, which is nice.


00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.000
There's some funny ones in there as examples.


00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.740
Just correct me up. I got to bring them up.


00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.500
Like, in fact, most frequently asked questions have never,


00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.900
and perhaps will never be asked.


00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.500
And then a quote, 89% of statistics are made up on the spot.


00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.700
[laughter]


00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.700
These are pretty funny.


00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.940
But it's kind of cool and that's not all.


00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.340
So this would be enough, actually.


00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.540
If it just generated this FAQ page, it might be worthwhile taking a look at.


00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.700
But it also has templates.


00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.700
It builds a template so that you can have a .FAQ.


00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.860
In the .FAQ, there's templates and you can tweak these to have a different,


00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.320
it's a different look to them if you want.


00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.620
You can add some more code.


00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.300
>> Nice.


00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.740
>> Then there's this suggestion,


00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.740
which we got to talk about these suggestions


00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.780
because it has a template for what to do on the suggestion.


00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.220
Why this is important is it comes with this hook that you can


00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.340
put into GitHub Actions.


00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.420
There's a built-in thing with actions,


00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.980
you can suggest something.


00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.460
If you suggest a question,


00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.140
it tries to figure out what the question might be using


00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.680
some fuzzy matching or something,


00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.940
which is a neat idea.


00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.960
Then there's an example right in there.


00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.180
Let's see, GitHub Workflows.


00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.780
You can look at the new issues and it's calling this factory.


00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.520
If somebody files an issue that's really just a question,


00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.580
and it figures out that there's something it can answer with,


00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.720
it'll answer for you.


00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.520
I don't have any projects that have that many issues,


00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.200
but I'm sure Will does.


00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.960
Some people do have these huge projects.


00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.720
Having a little thing that goes,


00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.100
"Hey, this question is already in the FAQ or something similar.


00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.020
Just go look there or here's the answer maybe."


00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.060
That's pretty cool. I haven't tried this, but it looks like fun.


00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.060
I think that's really excellent.


00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.260
Even for my limited small number of small projects,


00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.560
I still get things like,


00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.560
have you considered this or why is it different than that?


00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.760
It seems like it's the same.


00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.260
It's not the same.


00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.060
It's similar. It's not the same.


00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.560
Here's the huge long discussion on the issue that somebody filed that's closed


00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.260
because we're not resolving it and we don't leave it as an open issue.


00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.060
But you go look in the closed issues and you'll see the discussion


00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.460
and you can participate there, right?


00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.960
That kind of just point them in the right direction.


00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.260
Yeah, that's really cool.


00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.540
I think there's a lot of stuff like this.


00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.100
I actually talked with Ned Batchelder last week,


00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.580
seven days ago it says,


00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.940
on an episode that's coming out on


00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.140
Talk Python called Tools for


00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.100
ReadMe, Creation and Maintenance.


00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.780
>> Oh, yeah.


00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.460
>> As well as FAQs and


00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.340
change logs and those sorts of things.


00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.780
Remember I did a shout out for it.


00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.580
Give me all the tools for ReadMes on here.


00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.620
So this is the episode we ended up doing because


00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.060
three of the tools out of


00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.620
the eight or nine we covered were written by Ned.


00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.980
We're like, I should just have Ned on the show


00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.880
because it seems like he's a major topic here.


00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.320
>> Nice.


00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.400
>> Anyway, there's a lot of other tools that do that,


00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.000
but what I think is relevant here is


00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.720
this automation and this suggest feature.


00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.740
This is what makes it really stand out as being different.


00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.600
>> Yeah. Even on some of my small projects,


00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.620
I'm going to go ahead and turn it on and then probably


00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.720
issue questions myself and play with it and see how it works.


00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.060
>> Yeah. It'll be awesome.


00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.440
>> Yeah.


00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.360
>> Cool. Now, Steve in the audience,


00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.680
what's the answer to what's the difference between a duck?


00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.360
I must know.


00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.620
>> What's the difference?


00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.440
>> It's an FAQ. We'll put it on the FAQ,


00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.580
Steve, we'll help you out there.


00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.920
>> Yeah.


00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.900
>> All right. Should we go off to the next one?


00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.520
>> Yes.


00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.160
>> All right. So way back in,


00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.200
let's see, Python Bytes.


00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.420
We have a pretty cool search engine here.


00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.860
Search for Kagi, live with it.


00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.340
Way back here, we had Tina Huska on the show.


00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.420
I talked about this Kagi thing.


00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.820
>> Yeah.


00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.500
>> That was it, right?


00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.760
>> Like a paid search thing?


00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.400
>> Yeah. There it is.


00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.200
That was suggested by Daniel.


00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.880
At least I said, you know, like all I'll give this a try and I'll give you all a report.


00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.840
That was in June.


00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.360
Well, it's December now.


00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.240
So maybe not just one month, which was my idea.


00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.120
But I finally got around to writing up a report on Kaggy and, you know, TLDR.


00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.840
I'm still using it.


00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.800
I still really like it.


00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.400
So for those of you who don't have a six month perfect memory of the extras, I don't,


00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.360
don't doubt that it's, you know, faded.


00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.600
Kaggy is a paid search engine that is super privacy respecting and very customizable.


00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.280
So instead of being the product, you can pay for a product, which is search, which is pretty rare,


00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.520
actually, right? There's not many others that do that. So what I did is I went through and did


00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.120
a little write up here. And it's really kind of the, what are my thoughts on this? Why did I go


00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.880
through this whole process? But I entitled it paying for search in 2022. Am I crazy? Which,


00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.120
No, no, we'll see.


00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.880
So, some of the highlights of the savings,


00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.160
I'm really enjoying it.


00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.920
I laid out some of the reasons I think it matters,


00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.480
like surveillance capitalism is net-net bad for society.


00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.240
That is, you being the product by being tracked


00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.880
and having all of that information


00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.520
tracked across different sources,


00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.120
grouped together and resold through data brokers, not good.


00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.760
Most search engines, that's their business, right?


00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.200
Which is not great, right?


00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.520
And also, if you support small companies, we all win, right?


00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.020
Even if you don't use it, people are supporting small companies.


00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.900
We have many choices.


00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.740
There's just, there's just more choice, right?


00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.300
We don't, nobody wants a world where there's like one giant or two giant tech


00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.900
companies that make all the decisions.


00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.120
Um, and search happens to kind of live in that intersection


00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.540
of all of these things, right?


00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.100
So when you go to do search, you know, you're kind of supporting


00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.380
some giant tech company, but at the same time, you're also being


00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.020
tracked and resold and it's just.


00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.900
I classified it as like, some things are on the neutral good side, like duck, duck,


00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:39.820
go like they're mostly good. But there's also that sneaky behind the scenes thing with like


00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.340
only Microsoft can track our users. No one else can. We won't talk about it. A link to


00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:49.180
that. Others fully on the dark side. Right. So a link to an article about how to retarget


00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:56.940
your customers. So just some of the highlights here for Kaggy is it's totally privacy respecting


00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:02.460
because you pay for it. Right. There's no ads which don't lead to these perverse incentives


00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.000
One of these counter incentives.


00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.240
One of the things I really like is you can block websites.


00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.960
Like I just unblocked all the things that I had previously blocked.


00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.600
And I did a search for HTM for div tag event.


00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.960
What was the first result?


00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.080
W3 schools.


00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.500
I know.


00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.040
Do you ever run across W3 schools?


00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.560
Do you like it?


00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.160
Yes.


00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.720
No.


00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.720
That, and there's a few, there's a few of these that are just, they


00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.320
just turn out questions and answers.


00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.320
You're just like, could this just stop?


00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.880
Could I just never like, how are they so good at SS SEO and so bad at answers?


00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.280
Right.


00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.400
And so for those things, you could, there's like a little


00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.520
globey looking icon looking thing next to this and you can


00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.280
press it and just say block.


00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.640
I will never ever see W3Schools.


00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.880
Now, some people may have extensions.


00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.200
There's like a W3School blocker extension you can get for


00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.520
Chrome and other browsers.


00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.400
But I also really don't want to install like any more


00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.280
extensions in my browser than necessary.


00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.360
There's plenty of examples of like, oh, this extension


00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.480
became unmaintained.


00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.760
And so some company bought it and put some tracking into it.


00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.880
So not only are your searches tracked, everything you do ever is like now report.


00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.040
Right.


00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.760
Like, I just don't want to install those things.


00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.480
It's just not worth it.


00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.680
But here you can just say block these four or five domains or just lower


00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.560
them if you kind of want them to sort.


00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.000
Yeah.


00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.360
Oh, you, you muted.


00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.160
How did I mute?


00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.480
Sorry.


00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.400
Um, check this out, Brian.


00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.440
If you do a search for CNN, see how this globe turns reddish orange.


00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.840
Yeah.


00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.960
Just in the search results.


00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.880
This is on Kaggy, right?


00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.040
On the right next to it.


00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:28.920
And you're like, wait a minute.


00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.760
Why is it red?


00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.120
If you go over to it, it has a big red water.


00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.680
You can click it.


00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.520
It'll give you more information.


00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.320
It has a big red warning.


00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.520
There's 43 trackers detected on this page.


00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.400
So if you click on it, you're getting 43 trackers put on you.


00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.720
It's like jumping like that pool is full of leeches.


00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.380
Don't go in it.


00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.260
You're going to go in it morning.


00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.640
And it even gives you the categorization of it has fingerprinting advertising


00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.520
has Google as a tracking category and email.


00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.840
Isn't that nuts and cool.


00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.560
Yeah.


00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.160
I mean, cool.


00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.520
It tells you not cool that it is.


00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:55.880
Yeah.


00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.520
But then just to be fair,


00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.480
things like Vivaldi and stuff can block most of that stuff.


00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.440
>> Yes, exactly. So if you want to block it, you can.


00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.200
Certainly, you should be blocking it, I think.


00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.480
But anyway, it's also nice that the search engine


00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.600
is got your back in that regard.


00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.560
>> Yeah.


00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.160
>> This is the category of the site.


00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.080
>> Are the results good though?


00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.320
>> That is a super important question


00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.520
because if they're not,


00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.360
then all this doesn't matter.


00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.080
I would say they're pretty close to Google.


00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.640
I'm pretty sure that the cost, which is $10 a month,


00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.520
I think the cost mostly,


00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.000
because that can't be compute.


00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.980
There's just no way that it costs that much.


00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.040
I think the results are,


00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.960
I'm pretty sure they're buying


00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.040
Search as a Service from Google and Bing.


00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.480
>> Okay.


00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.120
>> I haven't been able to verify it,


00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.360
but they talk about enhancing


00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.520
their search results with open source and other results.


00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.120
So it's like, we've got those results plus.


00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.960
You know what I mean?


00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.360
>> Yeah.


00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.480
>> So as far as I can tell,


00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.240
They're pretty, it's quite similar to Google actually.


00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.080
I think it actually might--


00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.020
- But with the extra features,


00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.120
be able to block sites you don't ever wanna see,


00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.240
so that's cool.


00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.620
- Exactly, yeah, so here's the follow up


00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.120
to live with it, Kaggy.


00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.800
I give it a solid thumbs up.


00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.160
The only, really the only downside is that it costs money.


00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.640
Are you interested in paying another subscription,


00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.580
another $10 a month for something?


00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.400
For me, it makes me happy.


00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.640
I search for stuff just constantly all day


00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.320
and every time I'm like, yep, still not being tracked.


00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.160
Feels pretty good.


00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.680
And so for me, it's worth it.


00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.280
People can decide.


00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.400
- All right, well, I gotta say,


00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.520
this is a random comment from Vincent.


00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.040
I don't know how to read this.


00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.800
Once again, I'm rocking my baby to sleep,


00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.680
and once again, y'all voices aid me in doing so.


00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.320
So we're so boring, you're putting your kid to sleep?


00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.720
I'm not sure how to, no, yeah, I'm not sure.


00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.920
- No, that's awesome.


00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.720
Hey, Vincent, great to have you here.


00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.260
As somebody who had one of those baby carriers


00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.100
when I had twins, I would hook them both on me and I would sit there and like


00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.180
work on my keyboard.


00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.740
Cause like in the middle of the night, because they would sleep if they were


00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.340
stuck to me, but not if I was like trying to lay them down.


00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:00.700
Oh God.


00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:00.940
No.


00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.980
So hopefully we're just, I feel you.


00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.060
Oh, a newborn.


00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.820
He has a newborn.


00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.420
So they're not listening anyway.


00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.980
They're just our voices.


00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.340
So, or, or are they, and are they going to grow up to know Python by the time


00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:13.860
they're five?


00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.660
Yeah.


00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.300
Yeah.


00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:20.180
And know how to properly protect themselves against search engines.


00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.220
That's right.


00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.060
- That's right.


00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.100
All right, Brian, before we move on,


00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.860
let me tell folks about our sponsor,


00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.460
Microsoft for Startups.


00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.220
Microsoft for Startups has been a great support of the show


00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.180
and it's really good to have them on board,


00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.420
make sure that we can keep this going strong.


00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.100
You know what they don't have in this ad,


00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.940
by the way, Brian?


00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.880
Retargeting.


00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.460
We don't have any retargeting for you.


00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.540
So I'm sorry about that,


00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.380
but you do have some really great offers if you go visit it.


00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.260
If you start a business,


00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.060
obviously it's hard to get started.


00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.540
A lot, 90% or more businesses go out of business


00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.540
within the first year.


00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.420
And so Microsoft for Startups set out to understand


00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.860
what are some of the challenges


00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.380
and what are some of the assets


00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.280
that they can bring to bear to help that.


00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.460
So Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub was created


00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.540
and it has a bunch of free resources


00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.960
or once you accepted into the program,


00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.580
a lot of included resources that are just given to you.


00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.260
And they come in two categories.


00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.980
They come in bunch of cloud credits


00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.860
so you can run your infrastructure and code for no money,


00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.780
probably for free for a couple of years.


00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.500
And they also come in the form of mentorship


00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.060
and connections and information.


00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.540
So you get a bunch of free GitHub credits,


00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.980
you get a bunch of Microsoft Cloud credits,


00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.420
you get many from OpenAI,


00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.180
a global leader in AI research and development as well.


00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.660
And it's also not just about who you know,


00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.620
like it is so often for companies out there on their own,


00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.500
you get access to their mentorship network


00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.220
and giving you access to a pool of hundreds of mentors


00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.620
across a range of disciplines like idea validation,


00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.260
fundraising, management, coaching, sales, and marketing.


00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.980
That's definitely an important one,


00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.640
as well as a bunch of specific technical aspects.


00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.300
So you can even book a one-on-one meeting


00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.460
with these mentors, many of whom are founders themselves.


00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.180
So make your idea a reality today


00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.460
with the critical support you'll get


00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.320
from Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub.


00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.260
Visit pythonbytes.fm/foundershub2022.


00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.340
The link is in your show notes.


00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.380
Thank you, Microsoft, for supporting the show.


00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.680
- Yeah, thanks a lot.


00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.900
>> Is it time to rewrite some code, Brian?


00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.380
>> Yeah. This was fun.


00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.560
I ran across an article called


00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.540
Tools for Rewriting Python Code by Luke Plant.


00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:33.140
By the way, it's a gorgeous blog formatting.


00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.460
It looks like a book almost,


00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.100
but beside the point,


00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.300
we've covered a lot of these tools on the podcast.


00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.300
Things like Black and Isort and Linters and things like that.


00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.000
but it's kind of fun to see a whole bunch of things listed together.


00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.340
So by rewriting, we mean, hopefully,


00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.700
tools that change your code, but hopefully for the better.


00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:00.200
So we've got things like formatting, formatting and style guides like Black.


00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.400
And another popular one is that, I don't know if we've covered, is YAPF.


00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.300
Or yet another Python formatter, I think.


00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:14.100
And it's similar ethos to Black, but it's more customizable.


00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.720
So black, you can't, there's only a few options,


00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.600
but YAPF is often used by companies


00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.680
that have their own style guide to be able to customize it.


00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.840
But it's a little more tweaky.


00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.880
So you have to kind of get in there and set it up


00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.780
so that it follows your style guide.


00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.720
So there's that.


00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.740
There's AutoPep8.


00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.360
Isort, which I really like, which reorders Python imports.


00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.240
And so there's things like this, table format.


00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.220
I have to play with this.


00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.960
Makes it easy to align columns in your Python source code.


00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.020
I kind of want to try this out because that's


00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.440
something I don't like about Black and other formatters


00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.480
sometimes is they muck up my tables.


00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.600
But anyway, there's upgrade things, like PyUpgrade and Flint.


00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.320
You've mentioned Flint a couple of times.


00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.600
>> I'm a big fan of Flint.


00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.800
I run it on Python Bytes website code, on DocPython, on the train site,


00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.080
and it's great.


00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.800
Yeah.


00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.520
>> Actually, I just got a pull request on one of my projects,


00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.920
and I'm pretty sure they just ran Flint over.


00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.740
They're just going through and finding some projects


00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.380
and do a run in Flint and then doing PRs against them.


00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.380
And I was slightly kind of annoyed by that,


00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.420
but also like, I didn't have to do it.


00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.580
So yeah, thanks.


00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.420
I grabbed it.


00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:27.440
Type hints, which I didn't know about this stuff.


00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.660
So I'm kind of have to look at this.


00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.660
So things like pi annotate and monkey type to add,


00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.740
and there's a few others to add type hints to your--


00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.860
- This is super interesting.


00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.540
Adding type hints based on instrumented test suite runs.


00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.080
So instrument, I mean, it watches what functions get called and it says,


00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.940
Hey, this perimeter was always a string.


00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.940
This one was always a user object.


00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.380
So here's your type parameter, colon string, colon user.


00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.080
That's awesome.


00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.420
Yeah.


00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.340
Have you ever, and then I guess you know, I need to do this.


00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.100
Try it.


00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.080
Uh, yeah.


00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.400
Yeah.


00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.740
So I'm going to try these.


00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.540
There's a few of them.


00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.060
Um, so anyway, interesting.


00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:09.720
Um, some refactoring stuff is, that I, it mostly talks about, how a lot


00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.020
of these refactoring tools are built into IDs.


00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.220
And I'll have to say, I usually use an IDE-assisted thing,


00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.220
like PyLance or PyWrite, to do some refactoring.


00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.980
But I actually don't use them as much as I probably should.


00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.460
Usually do manual refactorings.


00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.660
But anyway, and then some standalone ones,


00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.740
like Rope and Jedi.


00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:34.340
And then the other category includes things like Shed,


00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.860
which I still have yet to try out.


00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.700
I need to try that.


00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.540
That combines a whole bunch of the tools.


00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.620
But one of the parts that I was really excited about


00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.220
is I didn't know about libcst.


00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.420
So this article talks about writing your own.


00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.140
There's a project called libcst


00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.180
that apparently you can use to write your own.


00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.180
It does a syntax tree thing


00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.980
and you can hopefully write your own reformatter.


00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.300
So that might be fun.


00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.140
- Okay, nice.


00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.100
- And one of the recommendations is


00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.200
The documentation's a little overwhelming for libcst,


00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.120
so maybe use GitHub or libraries.io


00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.080
to find other projects that are using it


00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.960
and then see how they're using it.


00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.600
And I love that way to understand how to use something.


00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.000
- Yeah, I need pretty much what this does,


00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.320
but I wanna change these two things.


00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.880
Let me copy that and go.


00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.760
- Yeah, I guess that'd be another way to do it.


00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.080
It's like fork black.


00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.480
Like the people that forked black and made blue,


00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.200
which gotta love blue.


00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:43.200
Wasn't listed here, but one of the things I wanted to bring up while we're right here is there's


00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.200
what there's upgrades like pyupgrade in flint.


00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:54.800
There was one of them that does set up pyupgrade which upgrades set up py to set up that CFG.


00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:01.800
I'd really like someone to figure out how to take all of your setup stuff and create a pyproject.toml file.


00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.200
Yes, that would be excellent.


00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.520
Anyway, cool stuff.


00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.680
>> Setup Py, Tom alert, something.


00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.360
>> Yeah.


00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.360
>> Setup Py. Okay. Cool.


00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.680
Yeah, this looks really useful.


00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.160
It's a really nice taxonomy of ways to clean up your code,


00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.960
improve your code, modernize your code.


00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.360
>> Yeah.


00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.840
>> Yeah. Very cool. All right.


00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.180
Let's go talk some web for a minute.


00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.080
Ciro, who I know listen to the show because sometimes drops into


00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.300
the live chat and gives some advice or feedback,


00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.220
created this thing called Socketify.py.


00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:41.820
So Socketify, I suppose the name is inspired by trying to do WebSockets really well,


00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:47.780
but it's a little more general web framework and server, as far as I can tell.


00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.460
So the tagline or whatever is bringing WebSockets,


00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.060
HHPS, high-performance servers for PyPy3,


00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.500
that's the JIT version of Python,


00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.660
Python 3, as well as CPython.


00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.540
So what's the website say for us?


00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.900
So it's pretty interesting.


00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.780
It's, if you look through here, you'll see,


00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.420
I guess we can see some of the features


00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.700
that has WebSocket support with Pub/Sub,


00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.180
fast HTTPS, I think that's probably the biggest thing


00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.260
that people care about.


00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.940
It runs on all the versions.


00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.380
So, you know, think kind of micro-Whiskey


00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.620
or UVicorn or something like that


00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.420
with a little bit of Flask type of stuff on top of it.


00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.220
Okay. It has URL routing, sync and async function.


00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.740
So it's kind of a mix of like a web server that is also a web framework.


00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.180
Fast TLS. What else we got here?


00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.100
This one's interesting for the async story is max back pressure,


00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.500
max payload and timeouts.


00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.540
One of the problems that can happen if you have async code is


00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.700
your async code will just accept the request and it'll forward it on


00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:01.460
through and await some database call or wait some microservice other API call,


00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:06.100
and it can just way pile up on your server and then like slam the database.


00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.540
And you might say, look, we only want to have 20 database queries in flight at a time.


00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.340
So you can limit how much pressure the web server is putting onto the database,


00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.580
and it'll kind of slow it down and say,


00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.420
instead of accepting more requests or doing more of this work,


00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.620
just queue up the response like a non-async web server would do.


00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.780
It has async support, ASGI web server support


00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.780
with extensions for Falcon, which is one of the web frameworks


00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.280
as well as a WSGI one.


00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.080
And some new features coming, but the real selling point,


00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.780
the reason people might care to check this out is the performance.


00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.880
So Falcon is pretty fast,


00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.580
UVCorn is pretty fast, but if you look at Socketify,


00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.480
I talked to Ciro and they're using the TechEmpower benchmarks.


00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.880
I'll pull those up in a second.


00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.920
I've actually pulled them up now.


00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.600
So over here on mass announces, follow up.


00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.640
We break a new record for Python.


00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.000
No other web frameworks able to reach 6.2 million requests per second


00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
in the tech and power benchmarks.


00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.080
As puts Python in the same ballpark is going rust and C++.


00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.040
Then we pull this up.


00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:09.680
What do we get?


00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.120
We get waiting.


00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.240
Ironic, isn't it?


00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.160
Wait on that.


00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.000
Well, look at this.


00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.240
You've got socketify at 6.2 million requests per second on the tech and power


00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.640
benchmark and then Vibora and Gibranto.


00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.720
And what's really interesting is like down here at 10, we have 360,000 for


00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.960
UVicorn, but follow me down here.


00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.120
There's a couple of interesting ones.


00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.400
Pyramid, go pyramid.


00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.040
I love pyramid.


00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.640
Python by stock Python or pyramid at the moment at a quarter million.


00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.240
We make our way down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.


00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.680
Async flask is at 57,000.


00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:48.560
Um, straight flask is at 8,000 and let's see, we've got tornado at 40,000.


00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.320
Here's another one at 50,000 for tornado turbo gears at 70.


00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.500
Another one at 90.


00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.560
And there's some variations on like some of the internal, like, is it


00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.440
PI PI versus CPython versus whatever.


00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.620
There's a bunch of variations in here, but there's a, some, some surprises there.


00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:04.120
Huh?


00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:04.620
Yeah.


00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.760
So, so here's the trade-off you got to make, you got to decide, right?


00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.400
Like this, this framework is cool.


00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.480
It's quite new with 230,000 stars, but it looks also quite promising.


00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.200
So for most people, you might not need something like this.


00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.420
It's kind of a lower level programming


00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.340
than say your standard Flask, right?


00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.420
It doesn't have as many extensions,


00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.940
but it also, it has some, I mean,


00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.420
if you get that kind of performance and you need it,


00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.180
right here's a pretty cool option you could try out.


00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.780
So anyway, I encourage people to have a look at it.


00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.900
It looks pretty interesting.


00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.340
It's also quite new.


00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.740
You know, last commit six days ago.


00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.460
So that's encouraging, right?


00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.060
- Yeah, and also one of the things I like


00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.220
about projects like this,


00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.700
that are assuming they're doing something different


00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.020
to make things faster than,


00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.700
think outside the box, do something a little bit different


00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.580
than everybody else is doing.


00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.660
Other people pay attention.


00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.860
So the people that are,


00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.980
these other frameworks are paying attention


00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.940
to what's going on here,


00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.480
and everybody learns from each other.


00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.700
So having a speed up in one area,


00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.260
maybe we can have somebody that take this


00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.060
and make the interface as easy to work with


00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.720
as like FastAPI or Flask or something.


00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.200
>> Yeah, absolutely.


00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.000
>> Or get some of the learnings from here


00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.040
and build those into the other frameworks as well.


00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.240
Yeah, maybe not for everything you're doing,


00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.080
but if you have some project or


00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.160
some part of your project that needs to be super high speed,


00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.840
this is a good thing to take a look at.


00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.520
>> Yeah, absolutely. I agree.


00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.800
Put it in the interesting category and


00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.680
>> Congrats, Cyril. Some pretty eye-in performance there.


00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.860
>> Yeah. Nice.


00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.640
>> Well, I think that's it for all of our items, isn't it? Our main ones.


00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.720
>> Yeah. I got a couple of extras.


00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.960
>> Yeah, throw them in.


00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.000
>> Yeah. I was actually going to cover this,


00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.480
but I think it's a little early.


00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.960
It's a project called Mouse Bender from Brett Cannon.


00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.800
The idea, I think,


00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.680
is around producing and consuming.


00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.120
It says, producing consumed dependency lock files for Python.


00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.760
And there's some goals for the project about,


00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.880
this project hopes to eventually provide a way


00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.520
to create reproducible installations


00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.160
for a virtual environment from a lock file.


00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.280
And so there's a lot of stuff going on here,


00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.120
but it's a little early in the project.


00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.240
So I just wanna point this out,


00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.640
and if people really care about packaging,


00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.240
maybe watch this.


00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.640
I care about it, so I'm gonna be watching this project


00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.740
and see if there's any way where I can contribute possibly.


00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.840
Anyway, mouse bender looks interesting.


00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.540
I don't think it's ready to use for anything yet,


00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.540
but yeah, it looks a little interesting.


00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.540
Yeah, it does. Nice work, Brett.


00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.540
And I think I got this from Brett too, but I can't remember.


00:26:54.540 --> 00:27:01.840
There's a page called devguide.python.org/versions.


00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.140
We've got status of Python versions


00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.980
and a graphic for all the release cycles.


00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.820
>> That's so cool. People need to see this graphic. This is cool.


00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:15.780
>> Yeah. It's neat because it shows you all the old end-of-life ones,


00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.140
and how long they've been.


00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:23.380
End-of-life for 2.6 was back in 2013.


00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.940
What are you guys doing? If you're still using that.


00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:29.260
>> They should put a skull and crossbones on the 2.7 and 2.6 or something.


00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.900
>> But so you've got a whole bunch in end-of-life.


00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.580
You got some in the security zone,


00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.120
which means if there's security fixes, they'll add those.


00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:42.280
But then you only got like six months left of 3.7.


00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.200
So if you're still using 3.7,


00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.140
it might be a good time to upgrade.


00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.680
But it shows all the,


00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.960
the only one with feature is 3.12 right now,


00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.200
because that's the one that's being worked on.


00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.080
It's a neat visual.


00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.040
This page is pretty simple too.


00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.760
At the bottom, you've got


00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.400
more specifics of when things are end of life.


00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.680
But at the bottom, the description of what all these mean.


00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.680
So what does feature versus end of life mean?


00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.560
Things. Good thing.


00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.320
>> Yeah, that's cool. I switched our website to run 3.11, by the way.


00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.000
>> Nice.


00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.440
>> Yeah, like a week ago.


00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.840
It's still running, so that's good.


00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:23.320
>> Yeah, I switched some of our test code at work to flip to 3.11.


00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.400
One of my team members says,


00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.480
"I wonder if we're ready?"


00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.960
I'm like, "Oh, yeah, we've already switched."


00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.160
(laughing)


00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.840
We've had a few, it's been doing it for a while.


00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.680
- So, do you have any extras?


00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.000
- Of course.


00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.620
So I thought this would be the only thing


00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.760
that I would refer back to my website for,


00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.640
but then that write-up I did on Kaggy.


00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.920
I'm gonna try to do a video version of that


00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.460
Kaggy Live With It thing,


00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.900
but I ended up realizing that that was gonna take


00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.440
way more time than I have this week, so I just wrote it up.


00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.920
But another one I wrote up,


00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.900
people can just check this out,


00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.360
is sometimes you should build it yourself.


00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.460
I'm embracing your not built here.


00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.660
Maybe we should just build it.


00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.380
I know we could buy it, but let's build it.


00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.140
Sort of talking about some of the things


00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.180
I did at Talk Python as well as Python Bytes


00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.460
and like how sometimes you sort of get


00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.100
into this cascade of things


00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.720
where new possibilities arise, right?


00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.740
So for example, one of the parts that says


00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.820
integrations abound.


00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.640
So for our live stream, right?


00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.900
We have our live stream here on YouTube at the moment


00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.700
and then it becomes the podcast.


00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.620
says because the way we put all this stuff together is not only do we do our


00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.680
live stream, but I push a button on the stream deck that announces this on


00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.700
Twitter and else that I'm asked to nine, I'm asked it on puts the website into


00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.260
live stream mode, but then that platform will, you know, Python bites will take


00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:46.580
the, the YouTube live stream, grab it's carefully crafted thumbnail, pull that


00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.340
down to actually become the social share image.


00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.740
So if somebody shares the episode on mastodon or Twitter, all the way back to


00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.180
the thing we did with the live stream is actually already producing the, the


00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:58.580
image.


00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.500
And so it just talks about like, you know, sometimes because I always have had this


00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.900
tendency, like, well, don't build it yourself, find something that works, find


00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.740
something that's out there and you have to break down and build it yourself.


00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.280
And I'm like, you know what?


00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.100
There's actually some really cool stuff that we've been able to accomplish


00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.140
because we built it ourselves.


00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.780
So here's a kind of a, an essay on that, I would say.


00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.260
Nice.


00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:16.620
Yeah.


00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.620
So people can check that out.


00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.220
Also back to the live with it side of things.


00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.980
I'm trying to support smaller companies


00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:29.260
and be less just integrated into like one big tech giant.


00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.460
So for my personal email, I've got a domain,


00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.180
mkennedy.tech is what I went with,


00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.020
which redirects to my other one for my blog.


00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.980
But then that was hosted on Gmail


00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.500
on like a paid $6 a month email, docs, whatever.


00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.500
And I just got really tired of trying to juggle


00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.680
two Gmail accounts, two Google Drive accounts,


00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.160
to Google calendars, all these things.


00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.480
I'm like, why am I doing this?


00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.560
Why don't I get a dedicated cool place


00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.960
that is like even a little more


00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.680
on the privacy side as well.


00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.480
So I'm trying to try and go all in on Proton.


00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.080
Do you have a Proton account to use this?


00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.200
- I don't.


00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.920
- Well, for a long time it was just email


00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.720
and like you can have like a proton.me


00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.920
or a proton.com or whatever.


00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:15.920
But I realized recently that they have other features


00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.620
where if you pay $7 a month,


00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.000
you get access to all of their things


00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.640
like their calendar and drive and VPN,


00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.600
but that doesn't matter to me.


00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.080
But you get three custom domains and 15 email addresses


00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:33.080
plus catch all email addresses and hide my email aliases.


00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.440
So I can have all of my different domains


00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.620
all have email addresses and that all basically


00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.200
resolve back to my personal email.


00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.080
- Ooh, cool.


00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:42.920
- Isn't that cool?


00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.380
And so I was at Google and I just changed the MX records


00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.840
and now I'm at Proton.


00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.840
And if I like it, I'll stay here.


00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.440
not I'll change my next records again and I'll be somewhere else.


00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.800
But try to take control of the e-mail so it's my thing,


00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.680
not something@gmail.com no matter what you think about it.


00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.800
Anyway, people can check that out.


00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.080
I just want to mostly point out Proton looks like it has more to offer than it used to.


00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.520
>> How about support?


00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:11.680
Can you just use your normal e-mail client to access all this stuff?


00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.260
>> Proton is like end-to-end encryption,


00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.280
which is a little tricky, but they have,


00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.880
What is it? It's called Proton Bridge.


00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.260
So let's go to the mail thing.


00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.580
So this is it.


00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.940
So what you can do is you can run this thing on Mac or Windows or Linux.


00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.420
And it's like a little,


00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.520
you connect to basically localhost for your email client,


00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.640
for your email server,


00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.120
and it talks to Proton with the end-to-end encryption.


00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.960
And then it just does IMAP at the last few,


00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.800
I don't know, it's not even the last step of the network, right?


00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.920
It's just, it's a loopback.


00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.160
And so yes, you can connect your, your usual things too with that.


00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:47.640
Okay.


00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.000
Cool.


00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:48.180
Yeah.


00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:48.680
All right.


00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.840
Uh, another quick one.


00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.800
There was a court in Germany that, stand on the kind of the same


00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.980
theme that decided that, Google fonts usage of Google fonts.


00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.780
Like if you look at a lot of web pages, they'll internally have slash slash


00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.240
fonts dot google.com some like open whatever, right?


00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.040
Some, some font name and like the weights of it that exchanges a bunch of cookies


00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.440
and tells Google about the visitors.


00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.260
Yay.


00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.920
And of course it does because even the YouTube thumbnail picture does.


00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.160
Uh, why wouldn't it?


00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.900
So, bunny bunny.net, which is the awesome CDN that we've


00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.960
were, I talked about a couple of times ago, a couple episodes ago, they


00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.080
released this thing called bunny fonts.


00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.100
And so bunny fonts is epic.


00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:34.160
They even talk about like this, this court ruling and, GDPR and stuff.


00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:40.680
But the idea is it's a, the bunny fonts is a drop-in placement for Google,


00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.040
- Google fonts.


00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:42.960
- For Google fonts, yeah.


00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.040
So whatever URL you would put into your website


00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.200
to get the fonts from Google,


00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.600
you just change the word Google to bunny.


00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.720
- Wow, that's really a drop in.


00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.640
- Yeah, and it's the same API,


00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.700
it's just you change the word


00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.120
and you get like super fast CDN backed,


00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.280
zero privacy leaking fonts.


00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.680
So you just, it's super easy to adopt, right?


00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.520
It's pretty cool.


00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.600
- Not zero privacy, hyper, yeah, hyper.


00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.040
- Zero privacy leaking.


00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.120
- Yeah. - Zero privacy trade offs


00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.000
or whatever, where's their, here we go, here's their fonts.


00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.840
But anyway. - That's cool.


00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.160
- Isn't that cool? - Yeah.


00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.440
- Yeah, so super easy. - Since it's a bunny, I mean.


00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.680
- You don't even have to have an account,


00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.280
and it's a cute bunny, I mean, their bunny,


00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.760
their iconography is really, really good.


00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.360
So there's a place where you go pick the font.


00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.320
So you come over here and say, I'm interested in Houma,


00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.640
or whatever, I don't even know a font.


00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.480
Let's say you're interested in this one,


00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.600
and you could just like say, I wanna add it,


00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.040
and it gives you like the little URL,


00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.640
which is just Fonstop Bunny instead of the Google one.


00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.760
So yeah, it's pretty cool.


00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.240
Anyway, that's all I got for my extras.


00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.880
- Well, that's great.


00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.720
- Yeah.


00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.560
- Good stuff.


00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.960
- All right, I have a joke for you.


00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.920
- Oh, let's do a joke.


00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.760
- Are you ready?


00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.580
- Yeah.


00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.480
- You've heard of ChatGPT, I'm sure.


00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.320
- I'm trying to not hear about it.


00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.400
- I know, I logged out so I could specifically


00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.360
show the homepage, so I gotta get back.


00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.560
Anyway, ChatGP, I'm trying to not hear about it


00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:12.640
as well. My brother actually shared this with me. Him and his son, my nephew, were playing


00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.800
with it, doing some coding stuff. Somehow they ran across this example. So this is a


00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.000
tweet from someone else that he shared with me. Riley, the tweet is not my brother. It


00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.440
says OpenAI's new ChatGPT explains the worst case timing complexity of the bubble sort


00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.880
algorithm. Okay, so what you can do is you can say, give me a step by step analysis of


00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.480
the worst case time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm


00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.500
with Python code examples, right?


00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.280
So that's not a joke, right?


00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.100
That's helpful.


00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.280
It could tell you, here's the situation,


00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.920
and it could like show you with Python code examples.


00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.760
But the next part makes it awesome.


00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.200
Give me the explanation with Python code examples,


00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.920
but write every sentence in the speaking style


00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:58.920
of a fast talking wise guy from a 1940s gangster movie.


00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.920
- This is good.


00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.740
- Are you ready?


00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:01.580
- Yeah.


00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.420
- Okay.


00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.240
All right, pal, listen up.


00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:07.400
She's a real simple one, but the worst case time complexity, that's a whole different story.


00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.920
You see, in the worst case, every element in the list got to be swapped.


00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.440
So the time complexity is going to be proportional to the square, the length of the list.


00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.000
Get it?


00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.760
Here's the Python code to help you out.


00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.880
See if you follow along.


00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.520
There's some Python code with comments, by the way.


00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.240
See, in the worst case, the while loop is going to keep looping until there ain't no


00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.520
more swaps to be made.


00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.080
In a loop, it's going to go through every element in the list.


00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.960
So the time complexity is going to be proportional to the square of the list.


00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.760
Get it?


00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.760
What do you think?


00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.200
>> This is good.


00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200
>> It's pretty fun, right?


00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.160
>> Yeah.


00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.520
>> Anyway, I don't know.


00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.040
The chat GP stuff is interesting.


00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.680
It's scary, but it's also funny.


00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.040
>> But does the algorithm work?


00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.480
>> I haven't run it, but I think so.


00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.720
>> It looks like the right,


00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.600
at least first glance, it looks right.


00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.600
>> I don't know. I could always go and


00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.400
copy the code and try to run it. What do you think?


00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.240
- Yeah, hang in there.


00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.680
- It's like too much work.


00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.960
- No, oh, the indent, the indent is off.


00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.160
That's, yeah, I'll, you know what?


00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.480
I'll run it and report for next time.


00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.200
See if the wise guy's code is actually any good.


00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.500
- Yeah, I'm up for, always up for volunteering you for work.


00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.380
- Nice, yeah.


00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.740
- Anyway, thanks.


00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.640
- Yeah, thanks. - That was funny.


00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.480
- Yeah, it was.


00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.300
All right, see you later.
