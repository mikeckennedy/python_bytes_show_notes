00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
Hello and welcome to Python bites where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your buds. This is episode


00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.680
104 recorded November 15th


00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.640
2018 I'm Michael Kennedy, but I'm Brian. Okay. Hey Brian. How you doing? I am great. Yeah, it's it's a wonderful day


00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.440
Yeah, it is and I'm doing one of my favorite things talking to you on a podcast. Yeah, same here


00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.980
You're all about podcasting today. It's like you just put a block the whole calendar day. It's just all podcasting all day


00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.840
- Yeah, yeah.


00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.680
- Right on.


00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.120
Well, I'm sure your other episodes on Test of Code


00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.680
will come out good as well.


00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.780
But before we get to our episode,


00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.900
let's just say thanks to DigitalOcean.


00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.600
They support the podcast massively


00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.980
and we're very thankful for that.


00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.280

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.240
to use towards your virtual machines and whatnot.


00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.800
Tell you more about that later.


00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.320
Brian, I would normally ask you


00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.340
what your first assignment is


00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.040
or make some not very great transition into it


00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.360
about like coyotes or something,


00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.380
but we're not gonna go down the coyote route.


00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.860
- Yeah, we have some exciting news.


00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.700
- Yeah, we do.


00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.520
So there's two things I would like to tell you


00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.620
about the podcast.


00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.060
One is new and awesome,


00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.480
and one has just been around,


00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.900
but we haven't really bothered to talk about it,


00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.740
and I don't know why,


00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.300
so let's talk about it real quick.


00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.260
First of all, we talk about six items


00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.180
and maybe a few extras more or less each week, right, Brian?


00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.020
- Yeah.


00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.220
- Our episodes are 25 minutes.


00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.380
Wouldn't it be nice if like you were interested


00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.220
and say the third thing to be able to just click


00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.800
on the third thing and hear just that


00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.400
if you wanted to jump back as a refresher or whatever?


00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.840
- Yeah, like you said, if you wanted to,


00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.180
you heard it before and you're like,


00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.260
what did they say about Wiley?


00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.100
And you could go back and listen to that.


00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.620
- Exactly, and we do have transcripts.


00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.500
We've always had transcripts and that's great.


00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.800
But now, the podcast MP3 comes with chapters


00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.120
in each episode.


00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.520
So if I open up, say, Overcast on my iPhone


00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.640
and I flip over, I think I flipped to the right two times


00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.060
or something funky like that,


00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.780
I see every topic that we cover now,


00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.860
and you can click on any of them.


00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.700
It tells you how much time we spend on each one.


00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.540
You can click on it,


00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.300
you can get a little independent progress bar.


00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.140
It's beautiful.


00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.960
- Yeah, it's nice.


00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.340
- It also works in Apple Podcasts.


00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.620
You gotta swipe up,


00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.860
and all the other podcast players, I don't know,


00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.620
but they support the most of them.


00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.500
Which one, what do you listen with, Brian?


00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.540
- What do I listen to?


00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.740
- Trade Pocket Cast for a while.


00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.940
Yeah, Overcast.


00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.780
I like Overcast.


00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.600
It's not perfect,


00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.100
but it's better than the others in my opinion,


00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.940
at least for iOS.


00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.780
- Yeah, I like it.


00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.900
I like a lot of the features of it.


00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.900
- I do too.


00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.700
So chapters, chapters are awesome.


00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.000
And they are now in there.


00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.340
And also, if you go to the episode page,


00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.780
I've updated the website for roughly the same capability.


00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.260
So there's a little play icon next to each chapter


00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.100
or each thing that we talk about.


00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.820
And this only works for episode 103 and forward.


00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.460
This doesn't work going way back in the past,


00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.760
but everything going forward, assuming we keep this up,


00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.340
it's a lot of work to do the chapters


00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.880
and figure out the times and put in all the pieces,


00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.580
but hopefully people like it.


00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.420
And, you know, as long as we're doing it,


00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.460
I'll put it on the website and you can click there as well.


00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.220
- And one of the things I like about the website


00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.220
is if I'm looking at a, in the future,


00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.040
I'm looking back at an old episode,


00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.300
yeah, I can listen to it without downloading


00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.140
the whole thing onto my iPhone or something.


00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.540
- Yeah, and I think people also don't understand


00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.580
how much we use our own site as reference.


00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.420
(laughing)


00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.340
- Yeah.


00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.180
- Like, did we talk about it?


00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.900
All right, throw it in the search engine.


00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.660
No, it's not there, so we probably didn't talk about it.


00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.660
Let me look at this other thing.


00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.920
Yeah, it's good for us,


00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.440
and other people can use it too, right?


00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.200
- Yeah, I mean, we've have over 100 episodes,


00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.720
six topics, we've covered over 600 things,


00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.320
so yeah, it's hard to keep track.


00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.200
- Sometimes multiple, yeah, there's a ton of stuff in there


00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.920
and it's good to go back and find the links


00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.720
and comments we put.


00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.920
So chapters, hopefully people enjoy them.


00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.040
Be sure to take advantage of them in your podcast player,


00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.240
especially for reference.


00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.720
And the other one is, we have friends.


00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.840
It's great to have friends, isn't it?


00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.560
- Yes, friends of the show.


00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.540
- We have friends of the show in the sense of


00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.560
people who send us stuff, and we love that.


00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.840
We also have the ability to send out notifications


00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.120
for everyone that cares.


00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.120
So if you visit pythonbytes.fm/friends-of-the-show,


00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.480
or just pythonbytes.fm and click on it in the banner,


00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.940
then put in your email address


00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.260
and you'll get notifications.


00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
I'm gonna try to start sending out more interesting stuff


00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.400
more frequently.


00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.660
You can check that out.


00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.020
But if you're not signed up there,


00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.260
you probably won't get it.


00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.540
So be sure to do that.


00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.380
You can even open up, say, Overcast,


00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.820
go to the show notes, click the title,


00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.540
and even become a friend of the show


00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.980
right from your podcast player.


00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.020
I think that's probably the most appropriate way to do it.


00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.260
- So are we gonna collect all these email addresses


00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.380
and then sell them to some list so that--


00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.180
- Yeah, I think we're gonna be so rich,


00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.420
we could probably sell them for two cents an email.


00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.460
- No, we're not gonna share those, of course.


00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.780
- No, we hate spam, we won't do that either, of course.


00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.580
All right, now it's time for the Wiley Coyote.


00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.860
- Yes, the Wiley Coyote.


00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.780
- And more friends.


00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.140
- Right, so (laughs)


00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.180
Anthony Shaw, we've talked about it,


00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.500
he's been on the show,


00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.180
he's been on both of our podcasts also,


00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.020
And he joked recently that he's going to, at PyCon 2019,


00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.740
he might put Friend of the Show as his name on his badge.


00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.580
So--


00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.400
>>Nice.


00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.500
>>So then, one of the things that Ant,


00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.860
or Friend of the Show, or Anthony,


00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.380
has been working on is a project called Wiley.


00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.140
And it is a Python application for tracking,


00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.660
reporting on timing, and complexity of tests,


00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.800
of the tests of your application.


00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.220
So it's sort of like, we have some complexity checks


00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.940
for your application or for your module,


00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.260
but this is a complexity of your tests


00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.480
and it's kind of an interesting project.


00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.180
But I'm not gonna actually talk about


00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.820
the testing part of it.


00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.200
Why I brought it up is he's done something


00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.200
that I'm not gonna say he's the first


00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.280
'cause it's possible that somebody else has done,


00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.240
but it's the first that I've heard of.


00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.220
Somebody that's done this new


00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.700
pyproject.toml style packaging.


00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.800
So there's no setup.py.


00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.740
It is pip installable


00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.540
And there's a lot of extra goodies that you can do with that.


00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.800
And he's figured out all of the weird things


00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.380
that you have to figure out to make this all work.


00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.260
So he's got like hooked up to read the docs.


00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.980
So the read the docs is generated.


00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.140
It's a restructured text based documentation


00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.460
that gets pushed to read the docs.


00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.620
He's got it working on the talks is set up.


00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.620
So there's talks configuration in there.


00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.420
There's a black configuration within the project.


00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.700
There's all the things you'd expect.


00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.400
Plus, he's got pre-commit hooks set up,


00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.360
and this isn't really part of the PyProject part,


00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.480
but there is a pre-commit hook for an example.


00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.220
And also, how to use, if you're writing a tool


00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.960
that you want somebody else to be able to do pre-commit with,


00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.700
there's an example hook there.


00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.960
It's kind of a lot of goodies, and it's not very much code,


00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.440
so I like it as an example.


00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.760
- Yeah, nice work, Anthony.


00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.120
That's really cool.


00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.360
I like the use of PyProject.


00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.840
Do you know if he's using Poetry?


00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.880
He's using Flit.


00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.120
- Flit, okay.


00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.760
Right, so Flit is another one of the ones,


00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.320
like Poetry or PipFim, but one of the ones


00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.160
that understands PyProject.toml.


00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.760
- And if you're curious to learn more


00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.200
about PyProject.toml, we talked about it in Python Bytes 100


00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.080
and then I also talked about it with Brett Cannon


00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.520
on Testing Code 52.


00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.040
- Nice, yeah, that's a really good example.


00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.280
Leave it to Anthony to be on the cutting edge of packaging.


00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.680
- The other thing I, it's a small package,


00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.000
but one of the things I like is


00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.800
his contributing guide includes the code of conduct right in there.


00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.500
And I think that's, instead of having it as a separate file,


00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.400
I like the idea of having it in this contributing guide.


00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.940
>> Yeah, I think the contributing guide should just link to


00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.040
Brett Cannon's presentation about open source expectations.


00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.760
>> Yeah, anyway, don't be a jerk.


00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.100
>> Yeah, you're giving me a puppy with this PR, just understand.


00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.220
Thank you.


00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.160
Thank you for the puppy.


00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.000
>> I think I will link to that in certain projects.


00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.160
Because I've got like, you know, like four contributors on my project.


00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.840
So wow, it's just exploding.


00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.320
That's actually pretty good.


00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.000
I think the step from zero to one is bigger than from like one to ten.


00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.480
Maybe.


00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.360
For most projects to get anybody to care, right?


00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.640
Yeah.


00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.160
Well, I'm having trouble getting myself to do more work on it.


00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.600
Yeah.


00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600
That's a different problem.


00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.360
So speaking of different problems.


00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.720
Yes.


00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.880
So let's talk about data science for a minute.


00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.960
The Visual Studio Code folks are building some really interesting tools and there's


00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.120
There's some quite unique things coming from it.


00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.200
So, you know, I'm a big fan of PyCharm,


00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.680
but if I'm not using PyCharm,


00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.440
VS Code is the thing that I would pick up and use, right?


00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.040
So it's like if I have something really small,


00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.720
I'll probably open it up with VS Code,


00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.080
like real projects probably stick to PyCharm.


00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.980
But VS Code is definitely coming along.


00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.720
(laughing)


00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.040
- I'm sure Brett can't love that, for real projects.


00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.760
- I know, I think it's more that PyCharm is more focused


00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.080
on working with lots of files and project stuff,


00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.700
and it doesn't make a lot of sense,


00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.920
as much sense to just opening up for like one file.


00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.160
It sort of can, but not as much.


00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.480
That's what, yeah, that's a good net.


00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.300
So VS Code is definitely coming along,


00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.640
and one of the things it hasn't had a lot of


00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.760
is support for some of the data science tools.


00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.380
But now, with the latest release,


00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.600
they just announced a really unique way


00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.080
of doing Jupyter Notebook type of support.


00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.920
- Oh, wow.


00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.560
- Right, so normally, Jupyter Notebook is like,


00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.240
you go and you open up the notebook,


00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.360
and you've got these cells and you type in the cells


00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.360
and you run the cells and there's like these IPNB files,


00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.520
whatever the extension is, they're not really Python files,


00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.440
they're like XML or something weird in there


00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.320
that has like embedded Python that can run, right?


00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.980
So this leads to all sorts of funky things


00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.640
like profiling it or testing it.


00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.780
All those can be somewhat challenging, right?


00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.640
Because you've got to like get into the notebook


00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.920
and whatnot.


00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.980
So VS Code has taken like a pretty unique approach


00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.360
where what they'll do is they will turn their editor


00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.900
into like a notebook-like surface,


00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.000
but it's actually still a single Python file.


00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.040
And you just put, what's the syntax?


00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.040
You put #%% and that line defines a cell in the file.


00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.820
And you get separate output from them,


00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.740
you get separate graphs and all sorts of stuff


00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.100
that you would have in like a side window


00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.360
out of the Jupyter notebooks.


00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.160
But you have a single Python file


00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.600
that you still treat as a single Python file.


00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.120
- Okay, does it generate a notebook file?


00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.660
- I don't know if it generates it, it will import them.


00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.040
So you could tell it to open a proper notebook


00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.360
and it'll convert it to this format that I just described.


00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.200
- Oh, okay, neat.


00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.840
- Yeah, so if you're doing any sort of thing with notebooks,


00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.920
this is a really nice way to kind of work


00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.960
in a full-on text editor style,


00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.320
but still get all the benefits,


00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.520
or most of the benefits at least, of Jupyter.


00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.520
- Yeah, neat.


00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.680
I do like that they're continuing.


00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.200
I know that there's a lot of work on VS Code making it,


00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.520
they're trying to make it even better and better


00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.040
all the time, that's a good thing.


00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.440
- Yeah, I guess some of the other things


00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.640
to throw out there that I added,


00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.480
now it has better support for virtual environments.


00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.440
So you can create a virtual environment


00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.960
in your project level directory


00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.720
and it'll detect it, things like that.


00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.920
So there's a few other nice things,


00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.560
better completion, whatnot.


00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.040
But the big deal is really the Jupyter,


00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.680
pseudo Jupyter support.


00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.520
- Yeah, cool.


00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.340
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.


00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.320
I don't do that much with Jupyter,


00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.840
But if I did, I would definitely consider this.


00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.280
I don't know if you would say it's the right way,


00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.560
but it's definitely a good way.


00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.880
- Yeah, I don't play doctor on TV, but nevermind.


00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.240
- All right, so speaking of the right way.


00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.480
- Speaking of the right way.


00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.180
So a lot of people have projects they're supporting,


00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.720
and we're thinking about, maybe not a lot of people,


00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.720
there are a lot of open source projects.


00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.160
One of the things that we've talked about is it's,


00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.080
if you have users, they might get upset


00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.560
if you change things.


00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.080
And change is inevitable.


00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.320
Don't fear change, send it to me.


00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.040
But one of the things you got to think about is your API.


00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.860
So, and APIs evolve, and so there's an article


00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.460
called API Evolution the Right Way,


00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.980
and this is written by A. Jesse Giroux Davis.


00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.220
And he is an excellent writer.


00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.340
I mean, even if you don't care about this topic,


00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.820
he puts really cool graphics in his articles,


00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.460
and also he's just a good writer.


00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.580
- He's a super storyteller,


00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.700
and this one is no doubt part of that.


00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.300
So check it out for that alone, right?


00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.020
- Yeah, and like it's, okay, the first line is,


00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.180
imagine you're a creator deity.


00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.100
I mean, that's just good.


00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.380
So he does it in an analogy of, you know,


00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.980
a snake gaining wings and things like that.


00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.380
But anyway, he talks about how to go about adding features,


00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.300
removing features, deleting features.


00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.500
That's something you sometimes have to do.


00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.980
And he also, and adding and removing,


00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.280
like, you probably wouldn't remove parameters


00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.160
from an API call, but you might add some.


00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.280
How to go about doing that.


00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.160
Changing behavior, sometimes things just aren't working


00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.080
the way they should, and they should work different ways.


00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.140
And he also gives some examples of things


00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.440
that even in the Python standard library that changed


00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.960
because the way it used to work just is weird.


00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.160
One of his examples was that you could date times.


00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.160
So if you did datetime.time with the parameters


00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.720
0-0, so that's an odd time,


00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.260
but it does happen.


00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:08.520
It happens if you have it in a loop and are checking to see if the time is not null or something,


00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.580
but you just said if x or if time,


00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.200
that'll return true sometimes if it's a 0-0.


00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.160
So that's converting time to bools.


00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.320
A valid time should return true,


00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.080
but it used to return false.


00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.280
and that was in pre, yeah, 3.4 and before.


00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.120
- Oh my gosh.


00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.380
- It returned false, and that's just weird.


00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.720
You know, sometimes there's just behaviors in your code


00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.600
that you didn't intend that you need to change,


00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.240
and how to go about doing that in a nice way


00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.640
if you've got users and a public API.


00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.880
So, it's a good article.


00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.300
- Yeah, he's got some good advice for sure.


00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.680
One of them includes not putting feathers on snakes.


00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.520
Another one is like, evolve cautiously,


00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.600
you know, avoid bad features, if you knew, right?


00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.680
Minimize features less to maintain keep features narrow mark experimental features as provisional


00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:07.880
Delete gently and stuff like that. Yeah provisional features actually are interesting the but they're still tricky like


00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.720
pipe for instance pie tests introduced an


00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:19.780
Experiment on how to deal with fixtures at one point and they're still they I guess just recently deprecated them


00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:26.800
So are they they've been deprecated for a while, but they're it took a while to it's hard to remove stuff because people might be using


00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.480
It yeah, yeah, definitely even even if you say provisional someone's gonna be like wait. Why did that leave I needed that yeah?


00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.880
Yeah


00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.000
It was yeah the test. I don't know maybe separate branches


00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.480
Maybe I don't know it's hard to know what to do to really push that out and let people test it


00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.800
But then actually take it away. Yeah, yeah, that's a tough one. Thanks for that advice. Yeah, yeah, Jesse. That's I mean


00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.640
That's a great article.


00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.680
I really love it, the way, all the pictures


00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.240
and the storytelling, and he's a great writer.


00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.180
Nicely done.


00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.240
Now, before we get back on one of our kicks,


00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.280
because it has returned,


00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.560
so I wanna tell you all about Digital Ocean.


00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.880
So Digital Ocean, super big supporter of the show.


00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.320
They're sponsoring every episode


00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.960
for the second half of this year,


00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.920
so thank you to them for that.


00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.880
And we've talked about, you're not Netflix,


00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.960
you're not LinkedIn, you're not Facebook.


00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.760
I just interviewed some guy from,


00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.840
a guy Colton from Adobe,


00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.340
talking about managing the security of 40,000 servers


00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.260
for some of their backend stuff and how they do that.


00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.960
Some people have those problems


00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.900
and the systems that manage that get pretty complicated,


00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.300
but most people don't have that problem


00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.740
and they shouldn't have to deal with systems


00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.760
that are way complicated to handle that kind of stuff.


00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.520
Most people wanna spin up a server,


00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.180
have a database server, maybe a firewall, a static IP,


00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.500
and if that's the kind of thing you want


00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.580
You can do quick, easy, affordable, reliable.


00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.020
Go check out DigitalOcean.


00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.620
So we use them.


00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.100
WeWork, Docker, GitLab, Slack, all those folks use them.


00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.820
And it's way, way cheaper, way, way simpler.


00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.700
You can get started right away.


00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.440
So check them out at pythonbytes.fm/digitalocean.


00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.900
Get $100 to play around and get started


00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.020
and definitely recommend them.


00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.140
Working out well for us, probably will for you as well.


00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:08.980
- Yeah, thanks.


00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.100
- Yep, thanks DigitalOcean.


00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.260
Now, I'm trying to remember, have we spoken about GUIs?


00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.340
- I don't think we have.


00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.180
- No, let's talk.


00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.380
We should totally do that.


00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.820
Let's talk about them.


00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.020
So actually, this is the thing.


00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.300
We talk about GUI so much.


00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.820
This item is back on Python Bytes.


00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.060
Like it is previously on episode 90,


00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.860
we spoke about this thing called PySimpleGUI.


00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.020
And PySimpleGUI, G-U-I, is--


00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.140
I would put it in the category of this other thing called


00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:38.780
GUI, G-O-O-E-Y, which is these are really simple ways


00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.980
to build kind of standard, not overly customized UIs.


00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.340
I just like quickly want to get like a UI up


00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.260
or I can get some input, show some stuff to the user.


00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.540
This one is more advanced than GUI,


00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.800
but still it's kind of meant to be,


00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.940
I want to get up something quick


00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.940
and not like massively complicated, right?


00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.620
Like you wouldn't build like a full on web browser in here,


00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.180
but you might build like a little utility you all use.


00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.820
So the idea is you sort of declare the types of controls


00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.200
that go on your layout and then it pops up.


00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.180
Now, one of my complaints back when we were on this kick


00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.620
in episode 90 was this is based on TKinter,


00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.060
and it looks like it's straight out of 1990,


00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.340
which was amazing, 'cause I love history.


00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.780
But I don't want my modern apps to look that way, right?


00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.140
And I mean, that's not a--


00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.140
- It was great music, bad user interfaces.


00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.620
- Exactly, I mean, come on, Black, Pearl Jam,


00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.820
we even have a package named after it.


00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.820
Anyway, so the idea is you can simply create these GUIs,


00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.540
but the drawback was it was built on TKinter, right?


00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.580
Which you can build nice stuff,


00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.900
but it just looks a little out of place.


00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.540
I think maybe based on our feedback,


00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.540
certainly on other people's feedback,


00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.060
Mike decided, you know what?


00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.780
Let's try to create this for Qt,


00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.020
'cause Qt looks modern.


00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.100
Qt looks nice, right?


00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.700
Like Qt is definitely a good looking framework.


00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.900
Like if you build an app in there,


00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.420
you might not know that it's not native,


00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.700
it's not built with Xcode, right?


00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.380
And Cocoa, something like that on Mac.


00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.820
So he took a shot at it,


00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.860
and in one week he fully created a Qt version.


00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.180
So now you have TK, Enter,


00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.380
if you want no dependencies, and you have a cute version


00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.140
if you want it to not look like Pearl Jam loved it.


00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.460
(laughing)


00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.460
- It really does look nice, so I'm excited about this,


00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.820
actually, so it's good.


00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.640
- Yeah, the new one is looking quite good,


00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.760
so it's sort of a declarative little builder.


00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.480
All you gotta do is pip install PySide 2,


00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.700
and it has no dependencies, it's a single Python file.


00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.540
It only works on modern Python as well,


00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.220
but he's sort of inspired by this.


00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.020
He's also working towards a WX Python and a Kivy,


00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.180
If he gets Kivy going, that would be pretty sweet


00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.180
because that would be mobile.


00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.020
- Yeah.


00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.020
- So far everything has been desktop.


00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.420
But if he can get Kivy going,


00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.020
Kivy's a mobile Python framework


00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:50.900
and that would be pretty killer.


00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.940
- Well and also, it'd be kind of a cool thing


00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.660
to try to do something like,


00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.300
if you had similar code and ran it,


00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.300
generated all these different versions,


00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.540
and then you can kind of look


00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.700
to see which one you like better.


00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.660
- Yeah, exactly.


00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.460
And I should point out the API is identical


00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.180
from TKenter and Qt.


00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.340
So you just do a different import statement.


00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.260
You import the Qt one instead of the standard one.


00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.420
And as long as you have the dependencies in place,


00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.380
the API doesn't change.


00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.580
So you could even do that at runtime.


00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.460
See if they have Qt installed.


00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.260
If they don't, fall back to TK, enter,


00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.060
and apologize a little bit.


00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.100
Sorry, but if you want this to look better,


00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.580
you're going to have to go run this line.


00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.860
Now, you should go do something like check out the FMAN build


00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.140
system, which will let you then take this thing, package it up


00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.280
as a installer for a binary,


00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.140
standalone binary for the various OSs,


00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.100
then you'll be in business.


00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.520
- And you can make millions.


00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.220
- Millions and millions of cents.


00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.240
- Yes. - Okay.


00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.420
- Okay.


00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.300
- All right, so nothing major,


00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.960
but just sort of an update on that one,


00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.660
because I think the ability to use Qt here


00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.000
is actually a really, really big deal.


00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.560
One of the other major things happening right now


00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.380
is a lot of the core development around Python


00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.260
is kind of put on hold,


00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:08.260
because nobody knows who to ask on how something gets approved, who approves it, or anything.


00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.260
Tell us more about this.


00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.260
People at the heart of Python are the core developers.


00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.260
They're trying to figure out all this stuff.


00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:23.260
So there's... and how since Guido has stepped down as official benevolent dictator for life,


00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:28.260
I'm not sure how that works, but the governance model around Python is changing.


00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.260
I think it used to be "Go ask Guido for final word," and that was that.


00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:37.620
Yeah, I think may have been like a little more like structured than that, but there's I'm summarizing. I'm summarizing


00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.540
how do we go forward is a topic and


00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:47.360
Victor Stinner who is one of the core developers also met him last year at PyCon great guy


00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.660
he came up with this summary of there's a whole bunch of different competing governance models and


00:20:53.660 --> 00:21:00.180
They are summarized at actually what there's one PEP called PEP 8,000 that summarizes all of them


00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.420
But they don't it doesn't really compare them. It's just a quick summary of the different ones, but there's a


00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.920
Their number 10 through 16. Why is that?


00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.480
There's just zero one two three. I think there's seven different models


00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:19.120
Of course Victor is put together a comparison of the different ones and how in different ways


00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.960
So for instance comparing them what their hierarchy is like how many people are involved?


00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.200
What does the terminal limits look like?


00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.880
What's the PEP process going to be like and whether they include code of conduct and stuff?


00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.440
And my guess is none of these are going to win just wholeheartedly


00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:40.160
There's probably going to be pieces of the different peps that get combined into whatever we end up with


00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:47.040
But if you're if you're curious about what the core developers are up to for your future, you can look at some of this stuff


00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:53.160
Yeah, this is really interesting and it's a bit of a catch-22 right like who even decides on the governance model


00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.660
(laughing)


00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.500
- Well, right.


00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.860
- 'Cause Guido explicitly said when he stepped back


00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.080
to just standard core developer was,


00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.560
and I'm not gonna decide for you,


00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.400
you all have to decide for yourselves.


00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.400
I guess maybe vote by core developer team, I don't know.


00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.120
- Yeah, so there's only seven.


00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.240
So, like, for instance, the first one is


00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.400
we just pick another leader.


00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.240
So it's something kinda like we have now,


00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.800
but it's a different person,


00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.880
a technical leader governance model.


00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.360
There's one that's led by a trio,


00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.680
So, kind of like that, kind of like Gato,


00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.480
but three other people kind of share that.


00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.920
- You know, when we talked to Brett Cannon


00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.600
and Carol Willing back on, what was that episode?


00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.360
Around 90ish, I'm not sure.


00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.180
Do you remember?


00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.020
- Wasn't it 100?


00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.720
- No, that was a different one.


00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.000
We did a special dedicated one on this whole topic.


00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.640
I just don't remember exactly what the number was.


00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.360
But anyway, I thought it was really interesting


00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.000
that I thought, of course, there's gonna have to be


00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.500
an odd number of leaders,


00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.200
because you're gonna need a tiebreaker, right?


00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.000
And Brett pointed out that some people are saying,


00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.100
you know, actually, it may be better to have an even number.


00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.320
So ties mean do nothing, and you have to have a majority,


00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.680
like a clear majority to make any changes,


00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.920
which actually I think, so maybe like led by four or six


00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.320
or something like that actually is an interesting option.


00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.720
- Yeah, but I think it's kind of cool


00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.200
that this is all happening in the open


00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.080
and people can comment on,


00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.080
people can comment on the different proposals


00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.080
and they can also comment on this summary.


00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.600
- Yeah, they definitely can, right?


00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.440
the bottom of the show page.


00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.280
- Yeah.


00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.440
- Nice, all right, well thanks for featuring that.


00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.440
It's gonna be interesting and I would guess we hear


00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.880
by the time PyCon happens what the decision is.


00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.240
I doubt they can go that long,


00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.100
more than close to a year without having any form


00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.440
of leading person or group.


00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.640
- One of the options that's not on the table is


00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.240
we can just say we're done and not develop Python anymore.


00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.320
(laughing)


00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.640
- No, that's not an option, we can't do that.


00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.400
It's just doing too well, but I guess it's always,


00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.960
an implicit option if we could just stop.


00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.040
All right, so the last one that I wanna cover,


00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.560
last main topic is this thing called Shaboken.


00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.200
Because it comes from GUIs and I'm back on my GUI kick.


00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.440
No, that's sort of true,


00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.920
but that's not why I care about it.


00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.620
So Shaboken is this subsystem that the Qt folks made


00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.260
to create the Qt for Python,


00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.160
which is basically they go to the Qt libraries,


00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.800
which are all C++ header files,


00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.020
and they want to make Python versions of that


00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.940
without maintaining a separate library that is,


00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.740
here's the cute one, here's the Python one,


00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.340
they'll get out of sync and whatnot.


00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.980
So they created this thing called Shaboken


00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.220
and the idea is you can run Shaboken


00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.140
against arbitrary C, C++ code


00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.340
and it will output Python libraries


00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.260
that interact with that at a C level.


00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.100
- And that's cool.


00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.940
- Right, so if you have any C code you wanna interact with,


00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.300
you can just run this against it.


00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.180
And it has like a type system,


00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.500
which is an XML file type of thing that you can customize.


00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:56.840
If you see this thing star in C, what that means is actually this type in Python.


00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.920
You can manage that a little bit.


00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.740
Standard string is actually str in Python.


00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.840
You could tell it to do those mappings.


00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.440
But then you point it at these libraries and it can extract them.


00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.040
You can hide functions or add functions, all sorts of stuff.


00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.040
It's pretty cool.


00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040
That is great.


00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.040
Automating the boring stuff.


00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.040
Exactly.


00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.860
Definitely automating the boring stuff.


00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:24.700
These folks are creating and maintaining it to build PySide 2, basically, at least the


00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.620
wrapper part of PySide 2.


00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.780
But you can use it for whatever you want if you have C code.


00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.740
It has nothing to do with GUIs or Qt or anything like that.


00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.740
And there's two in our same blog post.


00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.260
One is Qt for Python under the hood, which I'll link to.


00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.660
And that one basically shows you how this fits into their overall build system, which


00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.660
which has clang and C++ and CPython and all sorts of stuff.


00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.460
And then one that's sort of a tutorial


00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.340
called write your own Python bindings.


00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.980
And that one takes you through the process


00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.940
of more or less what I'm describing here.


00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.460
It creates some non-trivial C++ classes


00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.540
with public private members using the standard library


00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.900
and things like that.


00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.100
And then it creates a Python wrapper and then uses it.


00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.920
It's pretty cool.


00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.340
- Yeah, that is neat.


00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.780
Any idea where the name came from?


00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.100
No.


00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.500
No idea at all.


00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.300
There's probably a really great story where the name came from,


00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.900
but I don't know where it came from.


00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.700
So this is one of the options if you want to do C++ stuff.


00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.060
But there's others as well, right?


00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.180
So you could use CFFI.


00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.580
This is sort of a more modern way


00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.580
to explicitly write these mappings.


00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.660
And Dan Bader over on dbader.org actually


00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.860
has a good write up on that, so I'll link to that.


00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.420
Or you could use Cython, which actually


00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.580
is a really cool way to just directly import


00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.980
and start using C libraries.


00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.860
You just basically define the function shape


00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.820
and then you import the header.


00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.980
You say, this function comes from this header file,


00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.340
let's roll with that.


00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.100
And then you just start using it in Python.


00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.400
Of course, you gotta compile your Cython code with Cython,


00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.240
but it's pretty nice.


00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.300
And so there's a good example of doing that


00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.200
from scratch as well.


00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.300
So Shabokan, these other two, they're all quite interesting.


00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.140
I'll link to them all.


00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.980
- Nice.


00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.580
- Yeah, well, that's it for our official items, right?


00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.700
Got anything else you want to share?


00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.620
- I don't.


00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.460
Do you?


00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.860
- I actually have a whole bunch of stuff


00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.340
that I'm very excited about, but it's very short,


00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.680
so let me just tell you.


00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.540
First of all, I bought my PyCon ticket.


00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.380
Woo!


00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.820
- I still need to do that.


00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:23.660
- Yeah.


00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:24.480
- Exciting.


00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.700
- The big news is that the PyCon tickets went on sale


00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.060
just like three or four days ago.


00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.700
So I don't know if it sold out last year or not,


00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.100
but you don't want to be looking,


00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.980
you know, standing outside there by the Great Lakes


00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.540
in Cleveland, looking at the windows


00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.260
with all the people enjoying themselves


00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.480
and not be able to go in, get your PyCon ticket


00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.080
as soon as you can, 'cause it's gonna be fun.


00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:44.920
It's always fun.


00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.840
Looking forward to being there with you, Brian.


00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.760
- Yep. - It's gonna be awesome.


00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.960
And if you would like a closer, smaller,


00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.440
but still fun version, closer by definition to Brian and me,


00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.160
PyCascades tickets also went on sale just a couple days ago.


00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.960
This is the much smaller, like 200-person conference


00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.280
in Seattle, and this one will definitely sell out


00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.640
because it's so small.


00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.320
I think they received over 200 talk submissions,


00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.480
and they can only have 200 people.


00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.400
So I'm pretty sure it's gonna sell out.


00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.240
- Yeah.


00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.200
- Yeah, so look into that.


00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.240
That one's cheaper, smaller,


00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.120
and if you're in the Northwest, closer.


00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.320
But that doesn't describe many of the listeners,


00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.640
but yeah, it does for us.


00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.360
- So I'm gonna be going this year,


00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.200
but it's the first time.


00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.880
I didn't go last year, so I'm excited to check it out.


00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.800
- Yeah, I'm excited.


00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.840
This'll be my second year.


00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.160
I'm also going, and it's gonna be great.


00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.680
Okay, so those are the conference stories.


00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.360
Those are the two big conferences.


00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.680
You know, definitely the PyCon one is a big deal.


00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.680
The other one is, have I talked about GUIs?


00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.520
No.


00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.320
So the other one is a book that caught my attention.


00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.720
Like, there's tons of Python books,


00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.180
and sometimes they're interesting sounding.


00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.840
But this one really seemed to have a unique--


00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.480
like, really to draw the reader in.


00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.240
It was really a cool angle on it.


00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.440
It's called Mission Python, Code a Space Adventure Game.


00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.320
So basically, it sets up the story of this universe


00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.400
that you have to save.


00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.360
And it takes you using PyGame and PyGame Zero


00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.200
and all sorts of stuff to create games with sounds and graphics


00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.120
and just walks you through building this game.


00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.240
I think it looks like a super fun way to get into Pygame.


00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.240
- That's kind of exciting to check this out too.


00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.080
It looks fun.


00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.480
- Yeah, I'm like maybe this needs to be one of my projects.


00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.640
And then I remind myself, no, you're already too busy.


00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.960
Please don't do this to yourself.


00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.040
(laughing)


00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.440
- Yeah, like somebody said that we ought to go off


00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.360
and learn data science together.


00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.120
But yeah, there's a lot going on in both of our lives.


00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.440
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.


00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.480
Much of it around Python,


00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.600
but that bucket is getting quite full.


00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.240
But this is definitely one of the things


00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.480
that tempted me to add one more thing to the bucket.


00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.040
looks interesting. Yeah. All right, Brian, thanks for being here and sharing all this


00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.560
