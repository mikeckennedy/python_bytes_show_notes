00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.100
Hey, everyone. Hey, Brian.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.020
Good to be back.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.160
It's good to be back. I'm back in a place with somewhat controlled audio,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.760
although I'm having a bunch of tree work done,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.360
and one of those giant tree grinding machines is literally outside my window.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.200
However, I got a new microphone, and I believe it didn't even pick it up.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.060
It's ridiculous.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.080
So there's a bunch of onboard software stuff built into the mic,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.060
and it might not even affect us.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.980
Does it have a bunch of AI in there so they can correct your grammar

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.100
if you say something wrong?

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.840
That'd be cool.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.660
That would be cool.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.160
No, but it has noise gates and noise reduction and high-pass filters and stuff like that.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.500
With that, let's go ahead and kick this off.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.660
Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.560
where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.740
This is episode 382, recorded May 7th, 2024.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.880
I don't know if you caught it last time, but I was a year behind last year.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.440
So I said 2023 last time I was doing the show intro.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.860
But no, it is in fact 2024, despite what I believe about time.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.140
It seems like it's going too fast.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.200
Nonetheless, May 7th, 2024.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.760
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.840
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.480
And this show is brought to you by Scout APM.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.220
Check them out during their segment.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.680
It really helps support the show.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.280
Connect with us on Mastodon.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.800
All three of us are over there.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.080
Links are at the top of the show notes.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.320
If you want to be part of the live recording,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.000
pythonbytes.fm/live.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.620
Usually Tuesdays at 10 a.m. Pacific time.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.200
And finally, Brian, I know we sometimes talk about our newsletter,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.260
but people are subscribing and they're getting a lot of value out of it.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.140
So if you want an artisanal handcrafted digest of all the stuff we talked about in the show,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.460
deliver an email form so it's permanent right there.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.520
You can forward it, share it.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.560
All you got to do is head over to pythonbytes.fm,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.080
click the newsletter link right in the center of the screen,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.780
and then bring you to the friends of the show.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.780
Keep your email private.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.620
We don't share it.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.040
We don't do anything weird with it.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.680
We just want to be able to send you stuff about the show.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.240
So people are really getting a lot out of this, Brian.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.840
I checked last week the email that you sent.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.360
Yeah.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.160
Normal.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.240
If you're doing good, if you're lucky,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.440
if people really want to hear from you,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.540
there's a chance that about 20% of people will open emails

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.180
that you send in the newsletter form to them.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.880
The one you sent was like 95% opened.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.360
That's awesome.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.600
That is so awesome.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.280
Thank you, everyone, for actually caring and subscribing.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.360
So pythonbytes.fm, click on newsletter,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.960
and sign up for it.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.360
That'd be great.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.000
Yeah.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.020
With that, yeah, go ahead.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.700
One of the things I wanted to bring up is,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.200
so now there's two ways.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.360
Then if there's something that you heard on the show,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.860
but you can't remember what it was,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.380
you can search your inbox if you save it.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.800
Save our old emails from us.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.940
But we also, we haven't talked about it a lot,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.340
but the search box on pythonbytes.fm is excellent.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.100
It searches both the show notes and the transcript.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.020
So even if it wasn't listed, but it was said,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.600
it might find the right episode for you.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.400
So it's pretty cool.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.920
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.780
Yeah, I use that.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.220
I actually use that to decide,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.800
oh, if we talked about this thing before.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.780
Three years and I already forgot about it,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.680
or should I cover it, right?

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.680
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.240
Amazing.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.880
Amazing, amazing.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.500
All right.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.700
So we jump in to the first topic.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.800
Well, I want to act on that information

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.640
with a product called Act.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.920
And it's from Necto.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.280
Necto's, I think it's the person's,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.220
maybe just their name is Necto,

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.260
and it's their Act.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.760
N-E-K-T-O-S-A-C-T,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.960
but it's in the show notes or in the email

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.580
that you'll get if you sign up.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.980
Anyway, what it does,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.820
it's super cool.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.480
It runs, what it's doing

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.340
is it's running GitHub Actions locally.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.040
So if you could set up,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.180
you could set up this.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.300
What you have to do

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.380
is you have to install it,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.660
and it's got great installation instructions.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.220
I used Homebrew,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.040
but it's got installation instructions

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.800
for Chocolaty or even GitHub CLI.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.140
I could have used that

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.960
or Mac boards, Scoop.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.800
I didn't know what,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.900
I don't know what Wingate is.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.840
Anyway, getting...

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.420
Wingate is,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.880
you know how on,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.540
for example, on Boutique,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.420
we have ApptGet,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.880
Debian Systems sort of thing?

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.980
So that is the,

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:13.860
for a long time,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.460
Chocolaty was the package manager.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.540
It was kind of like Homebrew,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.660
sort of external for Windows,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.020
and Wingate is like

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.120
the official Microsoft package manager

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.760
for Windows.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.940
Oh, okay.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.680
It's kind of a new thing.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.860
I don't use it very much

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.880
because I don't use Windows enough

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.740
that I care about that stuff,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.900
but yeah, that's what it is.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.300
Cool.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.780
Well, so this project,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.000
really what it does

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.480
is it's,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.880
you can run your workflows locally,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.620
but you have to install it

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.300
and you have to set up Docker locally.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.860
So it could,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.100
because it uses Docker,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.860
which actually I kind of love anyway.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.420
So what it's doing

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.980
is it's running your actions.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.800
It loads up a Docker image

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.620
and runs your actions.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.420
But the control over it's really pretty cool.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.540
So I should have looked this up,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.080
but there's,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.440
you can,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.520
there's different runners,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.220
but the way you run it

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.700
is there's a bunch of different commands

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.340
that you can run.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.200
So you can run,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.140
run your pull requests

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.900
or you can run a specific job.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.580
There's a whole bunch of different,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.680
different parameters for this

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.300
to be able to run different pieces.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.180
I used it just to run.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.740
I wanted to just check,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.680
check my test,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.620
test run within locally.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.020
And because I wanted to play

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.100
with the different test jobs

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.680
and coverage,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.540
be able to run those individually.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.520
And it really was slick

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.560
and it's super fast,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.720
really easy to use.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.200
It's really pretty cool.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.520
It's also open source.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.280
So nice.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.420
We're going to link

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.980
to the GitHub repo as well.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.060
So you can check it out.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.780
And it's,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.040
apparently I'm not the only one

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.560
that loves it.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.980
It's got 1.3 thousand stars.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.360
So that's forks.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.920
50,000.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.500
Oh, that's forks.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.700
There's 50,000 stars.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.260
Nice.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.080
It's awesome.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.540
This is so awesome.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.380
If you do a lot of with GitHub actions,

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.380
this is so cool.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.640
one,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.220
you can sort of test it

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.940
and run it faster

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.160
and iterate really quickly

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.400
till you get it dialed in, right?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.880
Yeah.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.960
Then the other thing, Brian,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.040
that might be interesting,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.600
there was,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.480
I don't know,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.420
I'm kind of inspired a lot

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.080
by what the 37 signals

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.700
people are doing

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.000
around deployment and stuff.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.580
One of the things they did recently

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.980
is they moved their

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.080
continuous integration.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.500
Maybe even using this,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.860
I don't know.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.500
Moved their continuous integration

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.920
to developer machines.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.460
So instead of having,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.860
you know,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.380
one server where all the builds

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.160
just queue up

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.900
behind each other.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.560
It's like,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.220
everybody has a super high-end

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.820
computer is oftentimes faster

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.680
than the CI servers anyway.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.020
So run it there

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.940
is like a pre-commit hook

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.440
sort of thing.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.780
Yeah.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.180
Or, you know,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.800
some sort of push,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.340
some kind of event locally.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.040
And so this,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.360
it kind of lets you go down

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.280
that workflow as well.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.560
If you're like,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.420
we just want to distribute

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.160
the compute so we can make

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.820
our actions run a lot faster,

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.380
at least a good chunk of them,

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.640
you know?

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.200
Very neat.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.620
One of their ideas for this also

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.240
is to use it as a local task runner

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.320
instead of like make

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.120
or things like that,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.320
which is interesting.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.220
You could have workflows

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.800
that aren't reachable from CI

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.440
that you can just run locally

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.860
through,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.320
through this if you're already using it.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.400
That's really awesome.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.300
This is great.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.940
I love it.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.460
All right.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.720
Well, so since you brought up Docker,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.660
let's keep going.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.200
Okay.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.500
Let's keep going.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.080
I'll get there in a second.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.760
So I'm sure you're familiar with Ngrok.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.040
We've talked about how Ngrok

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.100
is awesome before

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.520
and it solves a super interesting problem.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.640
So Ngrok is a commercial project.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.700
I'm a big fan of it.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.200
I'm a pain user of it.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.900
We'll see if I continue to be honestly

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.860
after I read this out.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.640
However,

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.380
I'm a big fan of it, right?

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.240
So there's all these situations

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.380
where you need to easily get access.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.940
Something on your machine

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.780
in terms of an API or a website

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.540
needs access to the internet

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.700
just for testing

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.600
or just for a demonstration purpose.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.080
Like how often are you,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.220
you're in a Zoom meeting

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.920
and somebody's like,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.200
hey,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.760
I want to show you this new design

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.280
and this new user interaction.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.520
So let me share my screen.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.300
And then they're like on a huge monitor

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.140
and it's blurry

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.760
and you're like,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.140
I think I like it.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.000
I don't know, you know.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.440
But with Ngrok,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.500
you just say here,

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.640
just everybody connect

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.900
to my little local dev app

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.620
and click on this

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.240
and see how you think it feels, right?

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.520
Or you want to debug a web hook

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.200
which has to come from the internet

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.520
to somewhere public

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.980
so you can just fire up

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.840
an Ngrok endpoint

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.820
or use SSH

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.620
to tunnel

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.000
what would be regular web requests

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.900
into your machine

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.000
that turn back into web requests

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.240
to hit Flask or FastAPI

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.160
or whatever it is, right?

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.520
I did it for web hooks a bunch recently

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.760
and also for mobile apps.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.520
Oh, yeah.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.260
When Lauren and I were building out the mobile apps,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.340
they had to talk to

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.880
and just sort of do some callbacks

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.560
and other things

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.820
and we were testing out the API

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.300
and just like,

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:33.420
here,

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.280
we'll fire up an Ngrok

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.340
and he'd be on his phone

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.200
running the app,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.000
clicking with it,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.560
debugging it,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.940
and it would be coming through the API

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.020
hitting breakpoints in PyCharm.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.920
Awesome, right?

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.440
Yeah.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.140
But it's more of an individual type of tool

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.700
and also closed source and paid.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.800
Not that those are terrible,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.360
but they are,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:52.800
you know,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.260
that's what they are.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.940
So I want to tell you about Porter,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.700
like P-O-T-R,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.720
which is an open source Ngrok alternative.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.360
So the idea is exactly the same

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.800
that I just described.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.440
However,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.700
the way it works,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.940
don't watch the videos,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.700
they're very bad.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.980
Go to the docs instead.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.920
Similar though to Act,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.680
it has not as many,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.680
but 2000 stars.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.360
How old is it?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.360
Six months old

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.520
for a six month old project.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.140
That's pretty good.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.000
Yeah.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.020
So basically to set it up on the server,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.080
you have to have,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.640
it says a virtual machine.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.280
You need a machine.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.160
This could be,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.580
it could be a VM on the internet.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.680
It could be a VM locally.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.640
It could be a real machine

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.460
sitting,

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.000
you know,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.300
on a,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.880
on a beat up laptop in the corner

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.780
with a public IP.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.180
Who knows?

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.700
Whatever.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.640
You needed some kind of

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.120
pretty lightweight machine,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.780
you know,

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.340
$10,

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.920
$5 digital ocean server.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.660
You got to set up a cloud fair,

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.700
Flare token for wildcard

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.640
because it manages

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.320
subdomains automatically

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.640
and GitHub credentials

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.260
to log in.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.660
And then that's it.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.700
And the idea is that

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.880
it actually does,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.220
it's built for teams as well.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.660
So teams can manage

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.380
different ways

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.620
to call back into things

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.840
and connect things

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.340
and so on.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.100
So it's got like a whole

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.100
team dashboard

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.180
and people can set up

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.020
the teams and whatnot.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.280
But basically,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.520
you just set this up

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.160
and you run a Docker container

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.700
on a simple machine

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.580
and then all of a sudden

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.020
you've got your own,

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:14.780
very own ingrock

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.100
where data also

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.240
is not going through ingrock

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:17.920
but it's just

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.780
private to you,

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.380
of course, right?

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.040
Because it's HTTPS

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.940
over to SSL

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.560
and then back.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.040
Okay.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.140
So when you're,

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.780
is that,

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.420
is it setting up,

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.860
like ingrock,

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.200
does ingrock set up a Docker?

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:31.940
Does it go through

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.700
dockers also?

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.200
No.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.400
They run the server side

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.060
for you.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:36.620
Okay.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.160
They probably use Docker

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.060
but they completely manage

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.120
the server side for you.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.140
You just use a CLI

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.120
that like talks

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.620
to that thing

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.380
and then sets up

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.580
a connection,

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.640
an SSH connection

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.300
back to you.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.760
Okay.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.140
And then when I'm debugging it,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.000
if I set a breakpoint

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.400
or something,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.340
do I need to set that

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.720
in the Docker image

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.540
or do I need to?

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:54.820
No, no.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.460
The Docker image

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.360
is just a pass-through.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.080
Oh, okay.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.560
Got it.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.120
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.940
It really does work

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.080
just kind of like ingrock.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.160
It's super, super similar.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.680
I haven't used it yet

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.000
but I'm looking to start

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.600
trying this out

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.020
and then for the client,

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:07.440
you just,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.380
there's a couple ways

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.040
to install it

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.100
but pretty straightforward

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.140
and then you just,

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.280
instead of saying Docker,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.980
sorry,

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.060
instead of saying Docker

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.240
HTTP something,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:16.940
you say Porter

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.680
HTTP something

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.760
and off you go.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.300
Nice.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:19.800
All right.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:19.940
Yeah.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.060
Pretty cool.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.560
It sure is.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.500
You know what else

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.020
is neat, Brian?

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.980
I think Scout is neat.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.340
Scout.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.420
Scout APM.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.800
Scout APM is pretty awesome.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.580
Let me tell you real quick

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.500
about Scout APM.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.780
They're big supporters

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.640
of Python Bytes

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.160
so we appreciate that very much.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.760
So if you are tired

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.980
of spending hours

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.060
trying to find

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.800
the root cause

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.220
of issues

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.420
impacting your performance,

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.380
then you owe it to yourself

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.240
to check out Scout APM.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.420
They're a leading

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.340
Python application

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.100
performance monitoring tool,

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.700
APM,

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.320
that helps you identify

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.380
and solve performance

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.240
abnormalities

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.340
faster and easier.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.640
Scout APM

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.580
ties bottlenecks

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.580
such as memory leaks,

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.740
slow database queries,

00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:59.640
background jobs,

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.380
and the dreaded

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.420
N plus one queries

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.700
that you can end up

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.040
if you do lazy loading

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.200
in your ORM

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.820
and then you say,

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.220
oh no,

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.600
why is it so slow?

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.100
Why are you doing

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.980
200 database queries

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.940
for what should be one?

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:10.820
So you can find out

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:11.380
things like that.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.180
And it links it back

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.200
directly to source code

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.140
so you can spend

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.380
less time in the debugger

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.820
and healing logs

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.240
and just finding the problems

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:18.760
and moving on.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.640
And you'll love it

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.320
because it's built

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.100
for developers

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.820
by developers.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.720
It makes it easy

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.380
to get set up.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.040
Seriously,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.540
you can do it

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.920
in less than four minutes.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.760
So that's awesome.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.680
And the best part

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.480
is the pricing

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.800
is straightforward.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.040
You only pay

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.480
for the data

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:31.960
that you use

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.040
with no hidden

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.060
overage fees

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.300
or per seat pricing.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.380
And I just learned

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:37.700
this, Brian.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.420
They also have,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.840
they provide

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.680
the pro version

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.360
for free

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.860
to all open source projects.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.480
So if you're

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.820
an open source maintainer

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.480
and you want to

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.540
have Scout APM

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.360
for that project,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.660
just shoot them a message

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.080
or something

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.900
on their pricing page

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.260
about that.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.380
So you can start

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.220
your free trial

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.560
and get instant insights

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.140
today.

Visit pythonbytes.fm

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.800
slash Scout.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.760
The link is in your

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.620
podcast player show notes

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.040
as well.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.460
And please use that link.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.700
Don't just search for them

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.940
because otherwise

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.740
they don't think

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.420
you came from us.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.420
and then they'd stop

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.020
supporting the show.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.280
So please use our link

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.060
pythonbytes.fm

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.580
slash Scout.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.500
Check them out.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.800
It really supports

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.460
the show.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.840
Indeed, indeed.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.220
What's next, Brian?

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.200
We've talked about

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.220
type annotation a lot

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.480
and I ran across

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.220
this blog post

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.200
called Annotating

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.920
Args and Keyword Args

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.540
in Python.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.380
And actually,

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.780
I never tried that.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.800
I've mostly just,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.560
if I have

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.760
star args

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.840
or star star

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.020
kw args,

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.000
just sort of leave it

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.400
as is.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:31.780
I don't,

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.600
I haven't tried

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.600
type annotating those.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.740
So I was intrigued

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.080
as to how I would do that

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.100
if I wanted to do that.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.120
And there's a

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.260
article about it

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.240
from Redawan,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.520
I think.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.420
What's his first name?

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:45.960
Anyway,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.240
Redawan Delaware.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.140
Cool name.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.420
And it's the,

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.880
there's some

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.100
problems with all

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.560
the ways he tried

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.540
that seemed obvious.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.120
Like,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.160
sending,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.300
passing in a dictionary

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.180
that he expected.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.400
apparently my pie

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.300
doesn't like that.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.100
Or doing like

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.080
a deck

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.540
sort of describing

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.400
the tuple

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.360
or a dictionary

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.220
that are coming in.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.440
There were issues

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:09.920
with those.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.220
The,

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.480
but I'm just going

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.420
to hop to the end result.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.300
Apparently,

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.380
using,

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.380
using information

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.040
from PEP

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.660
589,

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.720
646,

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.740
655,

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.660
and 692,

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.160
there are features

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:21.920
like unpack

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.440
and type dict

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.600
along with typing

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.840
that we're used to

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.060
that are part

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.200
of the typing module.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.300
And the,

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.220
the result

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.460
is kind of cool.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:31.840
I mean,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.600
it's not terrible.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.200
There's a couple,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.580
there's a pre 312

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.620
and a after 312 version.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.100
I'm glad that he listed both.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:38.620
But you,

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.660
you set up a,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.480
a class

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.720
for your keyword args

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.820
and describe what the,

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.240
what the types are there

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.320
in your keyword

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.400
under type dict.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.480
And then

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.920
for the

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.060
star args,

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.040
it's an unpack,

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.060
you say an unpack

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.620
of a tuple

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.360
and then the types

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:54.880
of the tuple.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.420
So you can

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.920
do good typing

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.760
as to the,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.260
the types of things

00:14:59.260 --> 00:14:59.820
that you want

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.760
to come into

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.720
star args

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.860
or keyword args,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.780
which is kind of neat

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.000
to make sure that,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.320
I mean,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.840
you think of star args

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.480
or keyword args

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.160
as just anything

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:08.840
can come in.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.580
But if you really

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.560
don't want just anything

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.160
to come in,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.440
this would be great.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.780
So I like this.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.200
Yeah,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:14.500
it's cool.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.060
It's a totally

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.960
reasonable thing to think.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.120
Like I want to pass

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.000
one number

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.440
or two numbers

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.340
or a hundred numbers.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.460
but whatever it is,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:21.920
I want to operate

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.360
on numbers,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:22.640
right?

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.060
Yeah.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.080
Or yeah,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.580
I want in this example,

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.680
it's either integers

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.200
or strings

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.020
that I'm going to get in

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.920
or insert pools.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.640
So I would have

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.420
never come up with this.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.300
The creator class

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.280
derived from type dict

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.520
with multiple values

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.160
to then wrap that

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.900
as an unpacked of,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.520
okay,

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.220
I'm awesome.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:40.720
They have it.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.120
Yeah.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.720
But this is,

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.460
this is amazing.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.120
Yeah.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.420
Seems like there could

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.140
be an easier way,

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.560
but anyway,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.360
so this is pretty cool

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.380
and he's got

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.200
some great writing.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.280
One of the other articles

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.680
that I started

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.580
down this rabbit hole

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.620
was a more recent article

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.140
from April 27th

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.160
called typos

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.280
does what I thought

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.460
type guard would do

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:01.940
in Python

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.700
and I don't use

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.400
either type guard

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:04.980
or typos

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.600
so I'm not sure

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.120
what these are.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:06.960
But if you are

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.260
a type guard person,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:08.980
maybe you want

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:09.660
to check this out.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.040
Yeah.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.520
Yeah.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.060
All right.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:11.960
That also looks cool.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.700
Well done.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.080
Well done.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.280
All right.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.780
I have one more item

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.860
for us here

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.600
and it's pretty awesome,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.020
Brian.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:18.860
It's pretty awesome.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.060
Awesome.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.280
Ever since the,

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.220
the guy behind

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.200
just path

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.120
got thinking about,

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.380
hey,

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.320
people should use

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.580
the featured

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.460
on Python bytes

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.140
episode number badge.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:30.420
I'm like,

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:30.600
oh,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.440
there's probably more

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:31.960
to these badges

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.080
than I give them credit.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.280
I mean,

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.100
I know I've seen

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.660
plenty of badges,

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.580
but there's a lot

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:35.920
of badges.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.040
So this is a GitHub repo

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.180
with a thousand stars

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.600
that is a curated list

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.480
of GitHub badges

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.480
for your project.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.800
And let me tell you,

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.940
what are you interested in,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.180
Brian?

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.840
You want to talk about contacts?

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.840
You want to talk about groups,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.520
socials,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.660
operating systems?

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.460
Where are you streaming?

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.840
What kind of tests?

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.000
What kind of food do you want,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.620
for example?

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.260
Well,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.780
that's under the tests category.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.760
I think that's the failed indent

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.340
I'm right here.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.580
I think that's all just one thing.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.300
I don't think that's this level.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.760
I think the test got unindented

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.320
for some reason.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:04.940
Okay.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.800
What kind of terminal do you rock?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.420
And so on.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:07.820
Okay.

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.960
So I'll just go,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.700
I'll pick a couple

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.680
just to give people a sense

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.780
because I don't want to just read

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.500
a list of a bunch.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:13.820
But like,

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:14.300
for example,

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.060
you see the scroll bar,

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.300
Brian?

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:15.640
I mean,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.640
this is a lot.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.060
So under contact,

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.600
you've obviously got email,

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.260
but you've got,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.240
if you want to be specific,

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:22.680
say,

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.780
hit me in my Gmail

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.940
or hit me up

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.860
on my ProtonMail.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:26.900
You can actually have

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.580
those as badges.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.020
You can have Signal,

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.820
Telegram,

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.360
Tutanota,

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:31.800
Noda,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.140
however you say that,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.180
WhatsApp,

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.220
WeChat,

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:35.840
all those things

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.420
are pretty cool,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:36.760
right?

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.480
For groups,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:37.700
you know,

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.040
Slack,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:38.400
Discord,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.040
Zoom.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:39.680
Apparently,

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.020
I think Zoom is getting into like,

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.720
kind of trying to be more Slack-like,

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.980
even though I never use it for that.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.060
Reddit and so on.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:45.940
Under social,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.440
that would be

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.800
Bitbuckets?

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.200
Social coding,

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.060
I guess.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:53.800
I don't know.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.840
But,

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.080
you know,

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:55.620
GitLab,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.080
Instagram,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.200
Pinterest,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:57.980
Quora,

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.320
Reddit,

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:58.860
et cetera.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.380
And then you've got some for the OS,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:01.700
right?

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.360
Not just really standard ones,

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:03.580
but,

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:03.800
you know,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.560
like CentOS or Deepin

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.040
or,

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:06.540
you know,

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:06.760
whatever.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.620
But they also have their little icons

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.260
that go with them,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:09.460
right?

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.640
Like the red hat is red,

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.840
but it also has the hat.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.220
That is the red hat one.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.140
And I'll just go down a little bit

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.260
and find some more of the uncommon ones

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.280
down here.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.440
ETL,

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.100
that sounds boring.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.000
like mobile frameworks.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.060
So they've got like Flutter,

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.620
for example,

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.600
like the app I was just talking about earlier

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.200
that Talk Python is built on Flutter.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:28.840
We could have that

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.260
or Ionic or Cordova

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:30.840
or,

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.420
you know,

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:31.800
Xamarin,

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.380
whatever you want.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.220
So,

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.080
isn't that cool?

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.700
Yeah,

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.360
that's pretty fun.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.100
What security platform is using?

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.680
Is it like,

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.660
this is verified by Snyk?

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.280
And so on.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:40.720
Anyway,

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.700
so if you're thinking about your next project

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.260
or your GitHub profile or whatever,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.800
I present to you many,

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.280
many GitHub badges for the taking.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.780
Yeah,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:48.680
let's see if I can get like,

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.300
like four rows of badges onto a project.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:51.780
That'd be fun.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:52.840
Exactly.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.060
Exactly.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.220
Well,

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.920
any other extras?

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.460
Wait,

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.360
this is one that wasn't your extra.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.300
That's not an extra,

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.260
but I do have extras.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:01.860
Okay.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.280
I'll go,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.260
I'll go ahead and go through them

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.300
since I already got my stuff on the screen for us.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:05.580
All right.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.100
So this one comes from the Django Not folks.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:17.640
So the Django Not program is a program to help people who are interested in Django become core contributors,

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.660
not just users of,

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.860
but contributors to the Django code base.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.420
So it's kind of like a mentorship program around that,

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.580
which is excellent.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.760
And you must act soon.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.320
You have six days to apply.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:31.780
So the,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.520
the session two application is open.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.580
I actually interviewed Sarah,

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.640
sorry,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.140
Sarah,

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:39.860
Boyce,

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:40.440
Sarah Boyce,

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:46.380
and Tushar Gupta about their experiences running and coordinating the first one,

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:46.820
right?

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.900
back on Talk Python in March.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:50.620
Yeah.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.140
March this year.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.680
So if you want to hear more about it and you think maybe I want to apply to it,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:55.860
well,

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.160
you've got six days to do so,

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.120
to be part of it.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.080
It doesn't cost anything,

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.300
but there is an application process,

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:01.820
which is cool.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.240
That was fun.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.500
And then I was on Django chat,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.380
the Django chat podcast with Will and Carlton.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.720
And we talked all,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.400
yeah,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:12.760
I do too.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.120
Those guys are both great.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.480
And we talked all about this whole,

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:24.760
new deployment style and self-hosted open source and all these different things that I've been sort of talking on and off on about the show here.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.020
But we spent a good chunk of the show just talking about,

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.400
you know,

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:28.680
how,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.800
how am I running things for Talk Python and for Python bytes and for a bunch of other stuff.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.360
And then what are some external projects and some of the other advice?

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.280
And it's just really fun.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.440
So we had a good time talking to people can check that out.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.400
Extras for you.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.080
Yeah.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.820
I'm going to start off with some bad news and then some good news.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.060
So I came across this.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.180
It's from bleeping computer,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.060
but I saw it on a whole bunch of websites.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.840
Fake job interviews,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.600
targets developers with new Python backdoor.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.920
And it's just,

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.900
it's just awful.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.580
It's nefarious and evil.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.260
And I,

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:01.680
you know,

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.200
the idea of a lot of viruses is to try to get people to run code,

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.400
you know,

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.460
sneak in stuff to run code.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.140
They're just going straight to developers and saying,

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.400
Hey,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.200
as part of the interview process,

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.040
we'd like you to download like this repo and run the code in there.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.860
And then I don't know what they're telling to do after that,

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.320
but it's too late at that point.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:21.920
At that point,

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.060
they've just run the virus.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.540
So that's just awful.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.100
Anyway,

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:26.560
be careful.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:26.980
If you're,

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.280
if you're doing a job interview and they say,

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:29.480
Hey,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:29.820
go,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.940
go run some code.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.220
Maybe don't,

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.880
or look into it a little bit more.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.320
I mean,

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.020
it's so bad though,

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.820
because it could just be,

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.100
well,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.000
all you got to do is pip install the requirements and take this project and

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.920
then add this little feature and show us how you did it.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.120
Right.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.100
that already runs arbitrary code from the internet.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:43.580
Yeah.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.300
Oh yeah.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.780
It could just awful.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.220
That wouldn't.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:46.640
Yeah.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.260
Yikes.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:48.780
Anyway.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.160
Okay.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.520
So that's bad news.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.240
Good news.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.340
Good news is this,

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.800
this is the week that I'm going to switch the course.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.160
Uh,

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:01.140
the PI test course is a complete PI test course is going from a teachable to a new

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.900
platform podium.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.560
Um,

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.540
and it's just,

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.700
the reasoning is,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.360
uh,

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:05.640
the,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.920
you don't want to hear the reasoning,

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.060
but mostly it's the future of the,

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.100
that I'm working with for more courses and more things I want to do with

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.840
people teaching PI test and other things fits better with podia platform

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.100
than,

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.640
then,

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.040
uh,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.960
then with teachable.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.600
So,

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.280
uh,

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:20.540
to,

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.080
to sort of celebrate the switch,

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.180
I haven't made the switch yet.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.240
It's going to happen this week,

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.100
but you can already get to this new one.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.160
It's at Python test.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.120
Podia.com.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.100
And now through Sunday,

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.580
uh,

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.760
you get 25% off if you use the code PI test and,

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.080
um,

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.880
and that's P Y T E S T.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.820
And you can,

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.320
um,

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.420
find that link in the show notes also.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.340
Okay.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:41.820
So,

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:42.500
uh,

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.160
and lastly,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.860
um,

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.520
I know PyCon is coming up.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.920
I won't be at PyCon,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.460
but I,

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.100
um,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.800
I know a lot of great people will be.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.900
And so to celebrate PyCon,

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.140
I have a episode two 20 at Python test.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.300
That's getting the most out of PyCon and some great,

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.260
and some great tips from Rob Lubwick,

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.600
Rob Ludwick,

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.220
um,

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:02.760
about,

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.280
you know,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.700
having fun at PyCon.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.940
So check that out.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.440
Indeed.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.360
Yeah.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.020
I'm going to be doing,

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.640
um,

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.360
probably a data science panel podcast.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.200
That's also going to be live streamed with,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:14.520
uh,

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.900
the jet brains crew over there.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.340
So that'll be a lot of fun.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:17.600
Yeah.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.140
And I will probably do Python bytes,

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.980
but since you're not there,

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.780
probably not an open space in person one,

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.560
probably just sneak away to a quiet spot and we'll do it like this.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.220
Different background.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:27.880
All right.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.360
Awesome.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.040
All right.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.500
Is that it?

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.540
I had one more,

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.740
one last minute one,

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.580
which I thought was cool.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.080
Just a,

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.020
one I just threw in.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:34.540
Um,

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.120
I saw this on Amazon just before we started recording.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.120
Somebody named Orion Reed,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:39.660
uh,

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.440
posted this,

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:40.700
uh,

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.300
bookmarklet,

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:41.940
um,

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:42.500
that,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.000
uh,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.860
to visualize,

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:44.620
uh,

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.760
your DOM.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.900
it's a JavaScript book market bookmarklet to visualize your DOM in 3d.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.900
I love it.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.820
So cool.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:53.980
So it,

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.540
it may seem just like silly,

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.260
who cares?

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.880
But if you're looking at why is this thing overlapping that thing?

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.000
What about Z ordering?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.180
Or why is,

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:03.540
you know,

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.120
this is actually contained in that versus next to that,

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.140
like all that kind of stuff you would see from this 3d rotational thing.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:09.560
It's beautiful.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.060
Yeah.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:10.560
It's pretty,

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.160
pretty neat.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.340
So I'll link to that.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.660
That's all my extras.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.300
So,

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:15.720
uh,

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.620
there's a question out there,

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:16.780
Brian.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.780
This is an important one.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.380
Uh,

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.380
who will carry the Python staff of power at PyCon and Brian,

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.280
who will do this?

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.620
I don't know.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.600
I don't know.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.540
I know,

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.300
but I think there's going to be a great disturbance in the forest is what I'm

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:29.520
feeling.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.560
Speaking of which,

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.380
how about a joke?

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:31.900
Yeah.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.220
I have two jokes for people.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.020
One,

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.840
very heartfelt and sincere.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.280
And we're going to close out the show with that.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:37.940
But first one,

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.260
a sneaky little game.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.620
So this comes from Reddit and it's just on our slash program and humor.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.040
It's just,

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.240
just a little game.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.660
And it says import random import OS randomly get a number.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.000
Guess equals input.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.720
Silly game.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.380
Guess the number between one and 10 and it converts it to an end.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:52.980
Right?

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.020
So you would think of course,

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.040
if gas equals number,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.220
you won else.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:56.840
Sorry.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.820
You try again.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:58.120
No,

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.160
if gas equals number print,

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.100
you won else.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.020
OS dot remove.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:02.100
So you could do it.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:02.580
It's just terrible.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:02.940
It would really work.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:14.360
It would really work,

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.080
but you could do it.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.820
Like you could delete your user profile,

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.300
you know,

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.100
like stuff that doesn't require admin access.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.000
Oh boy.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.660
That's funny.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.940
Just a silly little game.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:26.580
All right.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.220
Let's close this show out with something special.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.820
I saw this come,

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.320
come through the news a little bit.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.980
So I think this is going to be a lot of fun,

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:35.280
Brian.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.700
I came across this.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.620
Actually,

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:37.800
you know,

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.720
this came from Dan Bader.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.280
He sent this over to me.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:40.540
Just said,

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.580
I think it was this said you wouldn't believe this.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.120
Check this out.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.220
And it's called permission granted.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.800
A sad girl sings,

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.900
sings the MIT open source license.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.700
Like for real.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.460
Okay.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.100
Okay.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.760
So it's AI generated,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.980
which is what makes it crazy.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.140
And it probably has Python involved in there somehow.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:01.260
And since AI generated content can't be copyrighted,

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.260
we should be safe to plate.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.080
Let's do it.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:03.720
Let's do it.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.400
We're going to close out the show.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:04.980
It's two minutes.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.740
You can listen to it if you want.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.140
If not,

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.100
feel free to mail,

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.220
but into the show is we're playing this.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:10.880
