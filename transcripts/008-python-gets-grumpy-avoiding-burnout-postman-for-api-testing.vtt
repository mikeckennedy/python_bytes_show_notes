00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.040
This is Python Bytes, Python headlines and news delivered directly to your earbuds.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.240
It's episode 8, recorded January 10th, 2017.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.760
This is your host, Michael Kennedy, along here with my co-host, Brian Okken.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.680
Hey, Brian, what's up, man?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.900
That's going really good.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.480
Yeah, glad to hear it, glad to hear it.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.280
I kind of feel like everybody's still kind of getting going after the winter break.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.840
I know we're both in Portland and our world has been covered in ice repeatedly recently,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.820
so it's been a bit of a strange start, but there's still Python news to talk about.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.160
Yeah, there is.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.980
I'm going to start with, actually, there was a PyBay 2016.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.200
I actually don't remember when that happened.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.260
It was sometime in the fall.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.660
I want to bring up one video, which is from Jessica McKellar, titled Breaking the Rules.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.920
From the talk, it sounds like it was pre-election, so at least it was in the fall.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.880
But yeah, the video came up in December.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.460
I was listening to it and was kind of blown away.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.760
So Jessica was the director of the Python Software Foundation for several years, and she's been

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.280
involved with lots of stuff, like the Boston Python user group, and she's the diversity

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.240
chair for PyCon.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.280
I guess she's an engineering director at Dropbox, which just sounds cool.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:29.780
But anyway, this was a keynote speech or a talk, and she was talking about all of her work with Python was not really about Python, but about studying systems.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.580
And here's some cool quotes.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.620
learning how to program changes the way you think about debug and interact with the world.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.100
And you learn a set of rules on how to build software, and then you learn that you can change the rules.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.900
And programmers master a system that they know they can change.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.100
And these sorts of comments that she talks about, I guess I knew, but I didn't really ever think about it before.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:06.140
And she takes it and she realizes that as programmers, we often take it for granted that if we're using a tool that we want to make better, we can just go in and make it better.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.280
It's an open source thing.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.740
And that this should carry over to the rest of your life.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.280
She takes the idea and applies it to politics and voting and stuff.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.900
I guess she ran a polling station by herself and her husband did a different one, which actually is pretty cool.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.580
But it's neat to hear somebody firsthand say it's not that hard to get it done.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:37.280
But I like the idea of thinking about how the programmer mindset and how you can change the system that you're working in.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.960
And I think more people should apply that to their workplace a little bit.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:51.320
I hear about people that are unhappy at their job, like a cubicle farm or something, and they get out and do an entrepreneurial thing.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.860
And that's great for some people.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.140
But for others, I think maybe it's better to look at the system and realize that you're part of it and try to make it better yourself.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.200
Picture yourself in your manager's shoes or your manager's manager.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.700
Wouldn't you want to hear from all of the employees if there's something that could happen to make it a better place?

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.520
Yeah, I think it's a great message.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.260
I think I really like Jessica's work.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.600
And I actually had her on Talk Python on episode 30.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.900
And she's done so much for diversity and the way the Python community actually is today.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.860
Like 10 years ago, it was very different than today.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.960
One of the things that she brought up in that talk was that I think she said five years ago, but not let's say a handful of years ago.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.220
The number of women speakers at BiCon was like 1%.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.220
And now it's like in the 30s, maybe low 40s percent.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.020
It's, you know, traumatically different.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.640
And there's a lot of changes like that that she was central in.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.680
So I think she does a great bunch of work.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.220
In that video, that was one of the questions is how did she do that?

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.880
And the answer is awesome.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.560
She just emailed a lot of people and asked them to submit talks.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.120
Yeah.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.300
And sometimes, you know, you just got to ask, right?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.820
And you want the world to be a different way.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.280
Sometimes you just have to ask or take the first step or whatever it is, right?

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.080
Like I think two ideas that sort of come to mind as you said that.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.660
One is there's a quote that goes something like this from Steve Jobs.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.840
Like the world around you was made by people no smarter than you.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.960
And you can change it.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.340
And once you realize that, like you can't just accept the world the way it is.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.480
You see that you can change it and you kind of must, right?

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.360
And the other is I really liked the notion of once you learn to program,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.000
you control the system as much as it controls you.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.960
And you can change it.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.480
And you start to apply that thought to the greater world.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.060
And I think that's really something valuable that people that are on this

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.660
learn to code, teach kids to code mission don't get,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.760
but would be a powerful benefit to students and just everyone.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.180
And it's another reason to teach everybody, more and more people to code.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.080
We don't have to generate an entire generation of programmers,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.200
but a generation that actually understood how computers work would be good.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.380
It wouldn't be bad.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.720
Yeah.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.580
I definitely think the world needs more creators, fewer consumers,

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.280
but not necessarily more programmers.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.640
Right.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.240
You know,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.180
people say that I'm a pretty happy guy,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.280
pretty optimistic guy,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.540
maybe to a fault sometimes,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.600
but usually people don't say I'm grumpy.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.660
But today I'm feeling a little grumpy.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.380
Actually,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.760
I'm feeling grumpy also.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.600
Yeah.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.440
And grumpy,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.660
this time grumpy is good.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.680
I think grumpy is good.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.420
Grumpy is interesting.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.020
So the guys at YouTube,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.480
particular guy named Dylan Trotter,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.960
wrote a blog post on the Google blog,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.460
tech blog.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.780
I don't remember exactly which one,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.520
but it's in the links.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.520
Called grumpy is a Python on Go interpreter or runtime.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.480
So at grumpy.io,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.220
there it redirects to the GitHub repository.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.680
They've built this thing,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.160
and it was released really recently,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.080
like three weeks ago.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.280
And what it is,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.800
is it's a transpiler.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.200
It takes Python,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.120
legacy Python,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.560
sadly,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.600
so CPython27,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.080
and it compiles it or transpiles it into Go code,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.800
which is then compiled and run on top of the Go runtime.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.320
So there's a couple of interesting things.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.700
It's one,

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.900
there is no interpreter.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.920
Two,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.780
it executes purely as Go.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.200
So all the features,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.620
and I really think the reason they're doing this is the concurrency story around Go,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.160
and maybe,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.580
maybe even a migration story.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.240
We'll see about that.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.820
But there's a lot of interesting things that they can do if they can get Python to run on top of Go.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.600
Yeah.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.140
So one of the things that also caught my attention about this is this seems to have really taken people,

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.660
captured their enthusiasm because it's on GitHub.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.180
They announced it a few weeks ago,

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.360
and it already has 6,000 stars,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.620
right?

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.800
For a project that's a few weeks old with 6,000 stars,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800
that's pretty amazing.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.620
So I'm actually having Dylan on Talk Python To Me on episode 95,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.520
which I think comes out next week.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.260
So look for a bigger story there.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.840
So is that one that's already recorded?

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.600
No,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.060
I'm going to talk to him Thursday.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.780
So what's,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.700
do you know what the reasoning,

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.200
I mean,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.440
like,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.900
I get why you'd want Go for Python stuff,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.180
but why is the language Go not enough,

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.520
and the Python language easier to write in,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.680
or?

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:21.580
Well,

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.420
I believe,

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.080
I don't know,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.800
there's certain things that they can't talk about or don't want to talk about,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.020
so I don't want to read too much into it for them.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.540
Okay.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.940
But Go is big at Google.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.660
YouTube right now,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.980
the front end for YouTube is written in CPython 2.7.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.340
So I would speculate that they're thinking of how do they not stay on Python 2.7.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:44.860
Yeah.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.600
Okay.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.280
Yeah.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.880
Pretty interesting.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.360
You know,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.080
another thing that would make me grumpy,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.180
not in the Python way,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.960
but really grumpy,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.540
is when I'm given a huge project,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.580
like,

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.160
you know,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.400
tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of lines of code,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:58.700
and they said,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:58.940
here,

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.840
look through this and understand this code base,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.600
and I look at some method or some set of classes,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.340
and I'm like,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.200
I don't understand what effect this has.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.500
It seems to do nothing in this code,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.560
and yet here it is,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.840
and I'll tweak it and play with it,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.700
and it doesn't even seem to have any effect,

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.700
and then I realize that code is never called.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.160
Yeah.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.840
Hopefully,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.060
it'd be cool if there was a way to say you could find some dead code.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.480
You mean like if there was like a creature that could like soar through the sky

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.700
and then would find these bodies and like consume them,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.260
and they would be gone,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:27.860
something like that?

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.300
Yeah.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.480
Yeah,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:28.660
yeah,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:28.940
yeah,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.020
yeah,

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.340
maybe,

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.120
or maybe we could have like a cheesy segue bot,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.000
but anyway.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.480
Exactly.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.120
There's an article by Dougal Matthews,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.260
and called Finding Dead Code with Vulture,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.060
and Vulture is a Python tool that you can install with just pip install Vulture,

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.600
and it's really easy to use.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.520
I downloaded it,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.080
applied it to some code I was working on,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.540
and you actually can just point it to a directory,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.200
and it looks at all the Python code there,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.820
and tells you,

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.060
I'm sure it analyzes stuff and does call trees and whatnot.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.960
I don't know how it works,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.520
but it gives you a list of all the functions and variables and lines of code that are not used.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.640
It was just really fast and really easy to use.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.260
I liked it.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.580
In the comment from Dougal was the,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.780
there's some people that use really aggressive unit testing and TDD strategies,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.540
which makes it such that every function is going to have a test for it,

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.560
but what if that internal function isn't used by anything else?

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.480
Well, there's a way you can take your unit tests and exclude them from the Vulture,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.460
which is kind of neat.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.100
I was thinking about, you know, the comparison.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.560
Normally, I would find this sort of stuff by using Flake 8,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.960
but like the example you gave, you wouldn't want to try to convert,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:51.360
you would fix all the, like the PEP 8 errors and things just to find dead code,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.660
so this might be a good use case for that.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:10:00.780
And also, there are some people that don't like static analyzers like Flake or whatever.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.340
The other comment was that coverage,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.200
if you're running coverage over your code with your tests,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.060
that should tell you that parts of the code aren't used also.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.580
However, your test suite's got to be fairly complete

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.680
in order for you to really be sure that that's true.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.860
So anyway.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.780
Yeah, it's tough to do it with coverage and testing, I think,

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.140
because like you alluded to,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:29.040
there might be some function that is never called,

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.960
but you might have written a test about it,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.260
so then it kind of looks like it's live again, right?

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.140
The thing where I find this to be really insidious is

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.960
I'm looking at some function,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.340
and I realize if I take it away,

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.040
this other function depends on it.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.060
And if I were to take that away, another function,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.880
and then maybe like three or four or five function calls back in this chain,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.360
these are all kind of dependent on each other,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.380
but nobody ever calls the first one.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.920
And so it's really hard to tell,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.520
like to follow all those chains and determine like,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.080
actually this whole branch of code that you're trying to deal with,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.620
just forget it.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.060
It's gone.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.800
You have source control.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.280
Delete it.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.540
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.260
I like it.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:04.660
Yeah.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.200
Yeah.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.540
They did warn about false positives,

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.160
saying something wasn't used when actually it was.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.640
So be a little careful.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.820
Like, you know, systems that use conventions,

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.820
like, you know, Pyramid or Django or something, right?

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.960
You map a route to a thing,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.560
and it doesn't look like you ever call that thing,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.400
but obviously it's called by, you know, a URL, right?

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.880
So just be aware of those sorts of things.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.020
But yeah, it looks really cool.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.720
Speaking of tools that are cool, you know,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.960
I don't get much meaningful mail these days,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.600
but I do like this thing called Postman.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.560
Yeah, definitely.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.120
I think it's at getpostman.com

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.740
is a cross-platform GUI app

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.160
that lets you test and visualize and play with APIs.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.600
I love my APIs.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.520
Yeah, so I've actually been doing some things

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.460
that required me to write some APIs lately,

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.800
and I'm like, you know,

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.260
obviously I could go into the dev tools in my browser

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.940
or I could write some, you know,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.460
some command line thing to test them,

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.520
but this is really nice.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.980
You can, like, create, you know,

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.800
here's how I call this function

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.940
as an authenticated user with this data,

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.700
and you can actually save that in this UI,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.880
and you can even create them

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.200
and share them across teams,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.260
integrate these into continuous integration

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.360
for, like, testing deployments

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.980
or more, like, integration tests

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:23.880
of your whole system.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.940
It's really cool.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:25.520
It's free.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.300
It's cross-platform.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.080
It's not written in Python, unfortunately,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.880
but, you know, it's still a really cool system.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.040
Question about that.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.320
When you say API,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.820
is that you're referring to, like,

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.280
REST API or some other web API?

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.440
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.060
Yeah, I should, it says APIs,

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.640
but I should maybe make it really clear.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.820
Those are services, like,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.020
HTTP services, SOAP services,

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:46.800
things like that.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.760
Okay, great.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.620
Not, yeah, yeah,

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.580
not, like, APIs,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.900
like, pip install this package

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.800
and then call this function.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.140
Yeah, well, you know,

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.700
when I'm testing or running on

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.300
developing a new API,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.520
sometimes I just,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.760
it's tiring,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.240
and I kind of get burned out on it.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.880
Yeah, you know,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.920
you and I have been programming

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.980
for a long time,

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.160
and I don't know about you,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.220
but I've certainly gone through

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:09.960
a period or two

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.640
where I'm just like,

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.700
ugh, more of this,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.740
and it usually depends

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.840
a little bit on the project.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.500
It's not really the programming.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.020
It's kind of like all the other stuff,

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.240
you know, nitpicking

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.600
at your time and energy,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.220
and so Kenneth writes,

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.600
I'm going to just keep going with writes,

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.300
not reads,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.580
until I hear otherwise.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.560
Kenneth writes,

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.780
does a bunch of great work.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.240
He's the,

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.980
for humans, guys.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.600
We talked about Maya last time, right?

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.040
Yeah, last episode,

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.860
we talked about Maya,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.280
and he's, of course,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.600
the author of requests,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.800
but he wrote this article

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.080
called The Reality of Developer Burnout,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.660
and I really,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.580
I'm glad he did it.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.160
I had heard that he was,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.400
I don't remember last year

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:47.720
or something,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.440
suffering from just like burnout

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.320
of being the main support person

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.100
for an open source project.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.740
Yeah, and he's not the only one,

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.380
like, gosh,

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.520
I can't remember the guy's name,

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.740
but he's in Lawrence, Kansas.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.320
He's one of the founders of Django,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.180
also just got totally burnout

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.140
and had to just step back,

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.160
and I remember there was like a,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.100
like a half hour conference presentation

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.340
that was kind of like a goodbye

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.560
or something to that effect,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.740
if I'm remembering it correctly,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.160
but yeah,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.100
there's,

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.180
there's plenty of stories

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:15.980
of people getting,

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.360
not just requests,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.340
but like angry email

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.960
for stuff they're doing for free,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.860
right?

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.100
Open source projects and so on.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:23.640
Definitely,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.420
and I think I'm not a,

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.440
I don't maintain a large open source project,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.060
but the,

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.280
definitely maintain tools

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.380
within our company

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:31.700
and,

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.100
and I think a lot of people

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.540
can relate to some of the things

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.640
that Kenneth talks about

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.260
in burnout in this article,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.100
but I,

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.080
I think he has some decent advice.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.460
Some of the advice he gave

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.060
was to just keep,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.240
keep producing,

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.360
but possibly not at the same speed,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.780
but stop consuming so much

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.160
on your social networks.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:51.680
He,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.960
he like disconnected

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.180
from Twitter for a while.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.020
He didn't quite pull a 410 gone.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.140
Right,

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:58.480
but,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.980
but like just stop following people,

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.860
stop looking at it so much

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.660
and,

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.940
and then he also talked about

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.620
delegating more,

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.120
trying to,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.220
it is a community,

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.500
so try to get other people

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.460
of the community

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.440
to take over

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.740
a lot of the roles

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.500
that he had

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.540
within the request community

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:13.860
and,

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.000
and,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.800
and then also generate

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.640
other hobbies.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.200
Don't do all of your free time

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.080
just doing coding.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.240
There should be some

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.780
non-programming hobbies

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.100
I thought it was a great,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:24.760
great article.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.660
Um,

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.220
and I was,

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.080
I was poking around

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.960
trying to get links

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.840
for the show notes

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.460
and I went,

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.600
came across,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.760
when I was looking

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.320
at the Maya,

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.340
um,

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.780
the GitHub page on Maya

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.640
and,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:36.980
uh,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.560
it said,

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.380
say thanks to,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:38.780
to,

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.040
uh,

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.300
Kenneth.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.300
And I had never seen

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:41.860
this before,

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.540
but apparently,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:42.960
uh,

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.200
I,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.860
there's a say thanks.io

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.120
that's a Kenneth project

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:46.520
that,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:46.840
um,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.680
that you,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.820
it just sends a little

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.780
thank you note to,

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:50.180
um,

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:50.800
to whoever,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.400
or the,

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.620
the person that set it up.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:52.900
So,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.780
I thought that was a cool project.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.280
Yeah,

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:55.500
yeah,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.160
that's really awesome.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.140
So,

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.120
for our final one,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.740
our final topic

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.540
brings us snapping back

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.160
to the future,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:02.840
you know,

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.980
away from Grumpy

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.840
and Python 2.7,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.540
back to current Python.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.240
Yeah,

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:08.760
and hopefully,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.900
you're not burnt out

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.560
on template languages.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.740
No,

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.720
I still,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.020
I'm still a big fan

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:15.900
of server-side

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.900
templated web applications.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.040
And one of the real popular ones

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.600
is Jinja,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.300
Jinja 2,

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.460
by Armin Roeniger.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.380
And he's,

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.880
he's the guy behind Flask.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.360
And he just released

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.900
Jinja 2.9.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.920
This is really cool.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.280
And thanks to Hugh Blanford

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.440
for sending us a note

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:31.780
to say,

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.420
here's a cool thing

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:33.840
you should,

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.700
should talk about

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.720
on Python Bytes.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.020
So,

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:36.500
here we go.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.480
And one of the things

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:38.860
that was,

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.400
stood out both to Hugh

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.500
and to myself

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.780
was the deep integration

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.280
with Python 3.6

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.860
and the asynchronous

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.520
concurrency story

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.260
around that.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.060
Armin says,

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.200
while Jinja 2

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.040
supported Python 3

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.640
years ago,

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.680
it never really fully

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.040
embraced the Python 3

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.700
features because

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.560
they wanted to make it

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.060
basically lowest

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.720
common denominator

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.240
so it would work

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.460
on Python 2 as well.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.720
But now they say

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.060
that it actually supports

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.420
async generators,

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.680
which fully support

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.300
the async

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.640
and await keywords.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.300
So,

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.020
it means if you

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.260
pass some kind

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:12.860
of generator

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.720
that is an async

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.260
generator

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.840
to the template

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.420
and it's going to

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.360
like loop over them,

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.740
it will await it

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.820
as it does that,

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.780
which is fantastic.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.860
That's just so cool

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.660
to see async

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.060
and await

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:24.860
and the concurrency

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.920
flow all the way

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.540
to the HTML.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.460
So,

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.460
where would this

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.420
like affect it?

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.680
When does

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.980
the template engine

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.800
end up doing

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.440
coroutines?

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.160
Well,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.500
yeah.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:34.780
So,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.720
the template engine

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.300
runs

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.160
after your

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.300
view method,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.080
your action method

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:39.580
runs and you

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.620
pass back the model.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.640
But the thing is

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.640
the model itself

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.620
could have a collection

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.080
that is a generator

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.960
and normally you

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.500
would just loop

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.060
over it,

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.700
right?

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:47.880
So,

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.300
I've got like

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.260
some kind of

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.480
set of results

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.820
and maybe that

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.480
came from a database

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.420
query or computing

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.300
it from a service,

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:54.680
who knows?

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.620
And you're going

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.580
to like do

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.480
a for loop

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.360
over it

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.020
and generate

00:17:59.020 --> 00:17:59.740
a bunch of,

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.060
you know,

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.480
10,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:00.860
100,

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.260
whatever,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.240
little sub

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.140
HTML pieces

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:03.720
in your template.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:04.600
well,

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.140
even if that

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:05.940
was asynchronous,

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.440
it wouldn't

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.020
treat it that way,

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.320
it would just

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.040
call it before.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.040
So,

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.420
now,

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.700
it can call,

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.100
it can do this

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.080
in an awaitable way.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:13.480
So,

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:13.960
my understanding

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.020
is that

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:15.700
if each one

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.260
of those steps

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.640
like has to go

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.580
to file

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.280
or network

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:19.820
or something

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.000
or it's like

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.780
a database query

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.620
and it's sort of

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.400
flowing through

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.220
as you generate,

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:25.960
as you pull the items

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.560
out of the generator,

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.720
it will free up

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.240
the thread

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:28.880
to go to other

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.560
web requests

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.920
while that part

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.340
is running,

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.260
whereas before it would.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:32.800
Oh,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.500
that's very cool.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.080
I like it.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.240
Yeah,

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.540
it's quite slick,

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.180
quite slick.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.260
Another week

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.020
in the Python world

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.860
and we have

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.020
a bunch of cool stuff.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.380
So,

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:41.880
you know,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.800
if you're using Jinja,

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.980
get the new version.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.280
If you're feeling burnt out,

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.800
check out Kenneth Wright's things.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.580
If you're doing APIs,

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.880
check out Postman,

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.300
bring out the vultures

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.480
on that legacy code

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.400
and check out Grumpy as well.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.400
Lots of cool things

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.620
and system programming

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.440
as a larger concept

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.320
with Jessica.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.900
These are good things

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.460
to check out.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.420
What's going on with you,

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:01.620
Michael?

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.200
Do you have any news

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:02.600
you want to share?

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.040
Oh,

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.500
I don't really have

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.460
too much news.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.360
I'm just working like crazy

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.300
on a couple of projects.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.080
Some stuff that I'm doing

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.880
got me interested in Postman.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.500
I'm doing a bunch of API stuff

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:13.980
right now

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.660
for a project

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.500
that I'm working on,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.940
but nothing I'm ready

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.560
to talk about.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.160
How about you?

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.180
How's the book?

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.080
It's getting closer

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.400
and closer to a,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.560
we're now targeting

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.260
hopefully a beta release

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.480
for PyCon,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.740
but I am,

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.300
I have a handful of people

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.180
I'm going to try to,

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.240
to get a hold of

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.600
to be beta readers

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.960
and not beta readers

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.360
but technical consults

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.840
to technical editors

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.360
to just read through it.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.840
I think it's a couple week thing

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.340
but if anybody's listening

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.860
and feel that they really

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.860
want to contribute

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.840
to making sure

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.520
I don't make any

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.560
pie test mistakes,

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.460
yeah,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.400
hit me up

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.640
and I'll put you on the list.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.240
Yeah,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:54.780
that sounds great.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.440
Get early access

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:55.980
to the book

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.340
and are you giving them credit?

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.560
Do they get like a little

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.420
thanks to?

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:00.900
Oh yeah,

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.340
definitely.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.400
And it's all handled

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.460
through Pragmatic

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.580
so there's a limited

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.340
number of people

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.420
so I don't know

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:08.960
how many people

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.460
they'll pick

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.580
but I want to give them

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.280
a bunch of names.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:12.900
Excellent.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.220
Well,

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.380
glad to hear it's still moving.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:14.780
Yep,

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.300
thanks.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:15.620
All right,

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.680

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:19.980

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.780

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:21.180
thank you.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:21.380
