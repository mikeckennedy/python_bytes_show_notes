00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.740
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.520
This is episode 261, recorded December 2nd, 2021.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.120
And I am Brian Okken.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.180
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.140
I'm Shell Genteman.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.360
Welcome, Shell. Could you let us know a little bit about yourself?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.160
Yeah, I'm a research oceanographer.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.760
So I study the sea from space.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.900
And I've been doing oceanographic research for NASA for a little over 20 years.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.360
I do almost everything using satellite data.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.000
So I never have to leave the comfort of my, used to be office, but now office at home.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.920
That sounds so fascinating.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.760
Is it fun?

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.740
Super fun.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.500
Cool.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.600
It's like math and physics and computers all mushed together.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.380
It's like all my favorite things.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.460
And oceans.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.680
Yeah, it's fantastic.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.360
And oceans.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.940
Yeah, that sounds like such a cool job.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.740
Welcome to the show.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.580
Well, Michael, what do you got for us to start?

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.840
Well, let's talk about our clone.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.060
So this one was sent in to us by Mark Pender.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.260
Now, our clone itself, I believe it's written in Rust or something.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.320
It's not Python.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.860
So the story here is not, oh, here's a cool thing created with Python.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.020
But it is a cool library that I think will be useful for Python developers.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.580
Okay.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.020
So this our clone thing syncs your files to cloud storage.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.040
Let me basically see my summary.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:34.260
So imagine you wanted to put some files in AWS S3, or you wanted to store something in Azure blob storage, or there's actually 40 different places where this can go.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:42.300
So like Backblaze, Backup, Box, Citrix, ShareFile, Dropbox, Google Drive.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.100
Let's see.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.980
Some stuff with OpenStack, KeyCloud.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.560
All these different places and formats, even just web dev and whatnot.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:01.680
So if you want to either read or write files to that location, what you can do with our clone here is it will basically mount those different locations as just something on your hard drive.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:13.840
So if you want to write to S3, you can just write to a file with Open slash S3 slash wherever it goes, and then write to it with Python or set up some kind of cron job that moves stuff.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:27.640
So if you're trying to move like large data for data analysis up to the cloud, so then you can connect it to a notebook, or you're trying to move files that are the back end of your website or your API through S3 or somewhere,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.100
then you can just copy files over sync different locations, like I said, mount it as a drive.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:44.240
And it has a lot of cool support for things like if the file transfer gets interrupted, it'll fall back to the last one that was working and then continue uploading.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.400
So it can be kind of interrupted and unstable and whatnot.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.540
I think this is so cool.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:59.980
It was just like, you know, when I first moved to the cloud, it was so frustrating having to figure out whether I was using S3 or the, you know, the Google commands or the Amazon commands.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.060
And all I wanted to do, get my data to where I could use it.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.880
I am so, so with you.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.380
And sometimes it's like, well, how do I copy files here?

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.580
Well, here's our API.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.480
Like, I don't want an API.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.560
I want to go to the Finder or to the Windows Explorer and draggy dropy the file.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.100
Can I do that?

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.820
They're like, no, no, no, you can't do that.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.420
No way.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.500
You can run our app maybe.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.340
Yeah.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.420
So this is, you know, in theory.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.880
This is so cool.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.620
Yeah.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.740
I'm glad you like it.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.080
That's awesome.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:32.360
I think it'll allow people to move data around from, especially it seems relevant to scientists who need to put a bunch of data in the cloud and run it.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.560
But then they might be want that data locally and keep it in sync and stuff.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.220
And it's really frustrating when your expertise is in something else.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.460
It's not in computer science.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.580
And like everything I pick up is because I'm only forced to learn it.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.640
And I don't want to learn the Amazon API and I don't want to learn the Google API.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.500
This like gives me maybe one tool that I can just be cloud agnostic and move my data around in a way that I'm already comfortable with.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.240
Yeah, I agree.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.460
Yeah.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.500
Here's the thing I was looking at.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.900
Yeah.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.340
So the virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems and apply encryption, compression, chunking, hashing, and joining.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.340
And it looks after your data.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.820
It preserves the timestamps, stamps, verifies checksums all the time, transferred over limited bandwidth, intermittent connections.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.880
It can be restarted.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.660
It checks the integrity of your files, all those kind of things.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:30.080
So, you know, like if you're out, I know you don't leave the house anymore, but if you're out doing research and like on a boat and you needed to like, you had this rickety connection, you know, maybe you could get stuff uploaded well this way.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.160
So I think it's neat.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.820
How do you like configure it?

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.060
You have to put in all your cloud stuff.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.100
I suspect you, when you set it up, you have to give it like, let's see, it's for your Amazon.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.320
That's Amazon drive.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.460
I forgot that that existed.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.980
Okay.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.260
Let's see.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.200
Yeah.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.700
You've got to give it like your, your AWS keys and stuff, of course.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.680
But yeah, they have a whole configuration section on what you give it here to set it up.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.740
It looks like you create a config file for it, I think.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.140
But yeah, pretty neat.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.100
Brian.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.600
Yeah.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.140
Brian, what do you think?

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:12.980
Well, so I'm trying to figure out like, even for something, for a mental model, is this like a Dropbox without version control or is it a completely different space?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.440
Well, I mean, it does have some tie-ins to there, right?

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.380
It's got like Backblaze and things like that, which is just a pure backup system.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.880
I think it's just trying to match like, how do I move files around to the cloud?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.500
And you can also, you can move it between the cloud, right?

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.420
You can mount two places and copy from one to the other.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.180
Like I can copy from Citrix share file over to box, neither of which I really know how to do.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.680
Yeah.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.780
Oh, it even has Dropbox as one of the configs.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.200
Yeah.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.700
Yeah.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.800
But different.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.440
This is actually pretty cool.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.280
I like it.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.700
Yeah.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.640
Very cool.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.520
Let's see.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.660
Kim out in the live audience says, I like this.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.540
Very few people really need to know or care that S3 doesn't have real files and directories, for example.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.500
And Sam says, it's funny.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.220
My group was just talking about how to transfer a huge amount of training data to our compute resources earlier today.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.220
I'm guessing that's machine learning training.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.680
Very cool.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.140
When you still have to go to Amazon or Google and set up the bucket, right?

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.240
So you're not spared that particular pain.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.500
Just like try to click public until it's public, but not too public.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.020
That's my approach.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.940
You still have to do that.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.440
But this seems like a really nice solution.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.020
Yeah, for sure it does.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.740
I guess over to you, Ryan.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.400
Yeah.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.860
So this has been suggested several times by several listeners.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.140
So thank you, everyone that sent this in.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.720
Oh, I'm on the wrong thing, aren't I?

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.600
I wanted to talk about check wheels.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.680
So check wheels are check wheel contents.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.900
So the idea around it is that there's...

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.020
So I'm often using Flit, and it kind of does all this for me.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.420
But there's other backends that you can use for building wheels.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:02.160
And if you configure something wrong, it might get the wrong stuff in there.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.380
So by wrong stuff, you might have like a PyCache in there,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.100
or you might deliver your tests with your wheels,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.340
and that's just extra space.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.040
You don't necessarily need that.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.360
Maybe your documentation should be there,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.240
but maybe it shouldn't be, depending on that.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.120
I don't think that...

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.140
Actually, I went on a tangent with the documentation.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.480
I don't think this checks for that.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.100
But so there's a...

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.520
It's just a pip installable tool,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.860
and then you can run check wheel contents.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.040
And you can give it a wheel, but wheels are often long.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.920
So I just...

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.300
When I've been trying it out, I've been just giving it my dist directory,

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.220
and it just looks all the wheels in there and checks things.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.620
So what does it check for, though?

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.920
So it's checking for things like making sure

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.000
that you don't have any PYC or PYO files in there

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.640
because you shouldn't have those in your wheels.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.200
Checks for duplicate files,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.680
because maybe you've got, I don't know,

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.360
copies your directories or something.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.000
And there's actually, I don't know,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.400
like 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 checks or something like that.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.360
I'm counting really quickly.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.820
But there's...

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.320
What I really love about...

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.180
One of the things I like about this is

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.460
there's a lot of things that you...

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.540
Like if you configured it totally wrong

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.380
and your wheel's empty,

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.940
it'll check for things like that.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.840
And yeah, you probably could test this and try it,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.780
but it would be nice to actually have something in your pipeline

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.000
to automatically check for these things.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.160
And it's really fast.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.240
The other thing I like is the readme for this project

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.240
lists of...

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.500
Has a very good description of all the checks

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.640
and why something like that could go wrong.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.840
So if, for instance,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.180
you happen to have your tests in there,

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.760
but you don't want them in there,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.180
how do you fix that?

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.400
Or it also says,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.460
if you actually do want your tests in there,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.000
how to go about putting it in there

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.240
so the check passes.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.320
So interesting project.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.520
Yeah, this looks really neat.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.300
I think if you're going to be creating a package,

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.760
you definitely don't want to be releasing things

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.640
that are not intended to be in there.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.320
I was looking through it.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.400
I wonder if it's possible to say,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.980
you know, check for certain files,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.820
make sure that they don't get in there.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.840
Like I'm thinking like a settings file

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.020
that has some sort of key,

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.460
like an AWS key,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.900
like we were talking about or something.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.000
But nice.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.920
Can you...

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.460
So I don't make lots of packages.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.200
So what's the wheel?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.580
When you're using that term,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.460
what does that mean?

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.560
It's the thing that you pip install.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.580
It's the...

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.360
They used to be just tarballs.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.840
It used to be tar, the JZs and whatever.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.000
But what we do now for the most part is,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.660
or hopefully,

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.880
is wheels are not...

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.260
If it's just pure Python,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.020
it'll be the same for everything

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.200
and hopefully it will be.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.480
But it can also specify

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.780
that it runs on Python 2 or 3

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.900
and that some of those sorts of things

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.700
can be built into the name

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.040
and what operating system.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.600
Because if you're building on,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.900
like say, just simplifying the world,

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.240
a couple versions of Unix

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.880
and Linux

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.000
and maybe Windows and Mac

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.180
and then also the new Mac

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.020
with the different architecture,

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.240
those will all be different wheels.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.180
But when you...

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.360
So when you pip install it,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.780
PyPI and pip will download

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.740
the correct wheel

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.920
for your operating system.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.240
And that makes it so that

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.320
when you're installing something,

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.380
none of...

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.600
You don't have to compile anything.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.420
It just brings it all down.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.920
So it's a cool format.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.400
Yeah, it's especially important

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.320
for the scientific community

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.260
because there's so many weird libraries

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.800
that have to get compiled

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.980
with things like Fortran,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.100
as we were joking about.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.740
And so wheels will basically

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.380
contain the pre-compiled version

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.500
so you don't have to have

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.660
like a Fortran compiler

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.260
on your machine

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.940
to pip install it or whatever.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.500
It just downloads and unzips

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.400
really quickly

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.340
without all that steps.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.060
I was told a simple mental model

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.760
of the difference of old and new

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.240
is the old style

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.760
with setup tools and stuff

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.920
would often have

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.900
a whole bunch of stuff

00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.780
that you download

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.060
and then you run setup

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.740
to like build some things

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.600
and redo things.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.440
Whereas a wheel is closer

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.080
to mostly just a zip file

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.660
that just unpacks things

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.240
and throws it in your site packages.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:11.900
Nice.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.400
And Sam also adds,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.280
you can also package

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.280
extension modules in wheels,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.320
which is their greatest strength.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:18.820
Very cool.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.300
Cool.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.040
All right.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.160
Brian, is that it

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.560
for the check wheel contents?

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.880
Yeah, I'm done there.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.580
Right on.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.160
All right, Shell, take it away.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.000
All right.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.780
So I thought we would

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.360
talk a little bit about

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.040
weather and climate data

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.700
and Python

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.420
and we're really trying

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.120
to get more Python programmers

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.280
involved in weather

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.260
and climate research.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.040
And the data, I think,

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.540
it used to be really hard

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.100
to get weather and climate data.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.340
It was in these really weird,

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.380
obscure formats

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.880
that only scientists

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.780
knew how to read

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.980
and they only wrote

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.040
Fortran routines to read them.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.500
But now with Python,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.480
it's becoming really,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.880
really easy to get these data.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.100
So the first thing is like,

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.080
where do you get the data?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.980
So I'm just going to show

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.840
the open data at Amazon,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.580
at AWS.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.280
But really, you know,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.480
Google has the equivalent

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.520
in the Earth Engine

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.040
and Google has all sorts

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.980
of open data sets.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.840
And that means that

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.140
they're free egress.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.800
So most of these you can get,

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.700
you know, you can access

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.520
data for free.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.180
And Microsoft has

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.200
the planetary computer

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.940
and they're building up

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.720
the same thing.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.740
And like you can see

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.600
lots of people

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.200
are putting data on here.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.220
Like NASA has

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.180
a Space Act agreement.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.260
There's the NOAA,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.420
which is our weather agency,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.640
the big data program.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.100
And so like you can

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.200
look for data.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.300
And one of the biggest

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.920
data sets that I work with

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.180
is ERA-5.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.860
And if you just sort of

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.560
type in here

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.360
and it brings up

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.020
the data set

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.660
and you can click on that

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.500
and see they have it

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.840
in these two different formats.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.240
So one is SAR

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.800
and one is NetCDF.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.040
And most people

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.420
in sort of data science

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.700
work with, you know,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.980
SQL databases

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.040
or maybe they're doing

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.120
CVS files

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.160
or tabular data.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.400
So weather and climate data

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.200
is a little different

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.440
because it's three-dimensional.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.720
And so there's these

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.220
different data formats

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.000
and really almost all

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.140
of the weather and climate data

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.280
now is currently

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.580
in this NetCDF format.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.780
The goal is

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:09.820
let's just write

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.720
a Python library

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.880
and make it so you don't

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.460
care about the format, right?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.480
The data formats,

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.280
the people who produce

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.380
the data should care about it.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.160
But as a user,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.320
what we want is

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.040
we want anybody

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.020
to be able to use it

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.860
and do anything

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.660
they can think of.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.500
And so that's

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.660
this sort of X-Array.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.860
So X-Array

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.320
is a Python library

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.180
that is designed

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.540
for sort of

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.240
three-dimensional

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.120
structured data.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.080
And all the data

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.780
has labels

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.800
and it has these things

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.920
called data sets

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.760
so that it organizes

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.680
your data for you

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.100
and to read it

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.880
you just sort of say

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.920
open data set.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.460
Nice.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.320
And it understands

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.360
these formats?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.140
Yeah.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.760
And like I'm going to bring up

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.420
a little example here

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.540
but this ERA5,

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.480
I mean this is like

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.480
I think it's

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.840
35 terabytes of data.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.380
So I took this

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.740
off of the AWS.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.360
why did it take it off?

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.520
I ran it on AWS

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.980
and I subsampled it.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.380
Because where are you

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.060
going to put it, right?

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:02.500
Yeah.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.760
I mean it used to be

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.520
that like to get

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.240
this data set

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.520
you had to write a script

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.360
and then you would

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.340
download it for like

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:10.960
three months.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.680
And now it's just

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.240
on AWS

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.940
which is like

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.820
mind-blowing, right?

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.720
Like I log on

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.680
and a few minutes later

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.000
I actually have access

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.980
to all this data

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.240
which is so cool.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.080
So like with X-Array

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.940
I'm going to run this cell

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.020
and basically I just

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.880
import X-Array

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.880
as X-Array

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.860
to read the data

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.840
I just say like

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.720
open data set.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.440
That's it.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.560
And it figures it out.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.900
And it'll read almost

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.680
it'll read a lot

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.540
of different formats

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.480
and it just has your data.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.780
And so this is like

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.080
a really big data set

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.840
and it tells you

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.660
all about it

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.080
and you can look

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.980
at the different data

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.900
that it has.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.600
and you know

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.260
sort of the goal

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:48.660
with this

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.360
is to make it

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.460
really really easy

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.340
for anybody.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.700
Like let's say

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.260
you want to look

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:53.800
at you know

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800
sales patterns

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.700
in San Francisco

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.600
or you want to work

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.400
at ship traffic

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.060
or you want to look

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:58.740
at how weather

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.900
is evolving

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.140
at your location.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.260
Like you don't need

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:02.760
to know about

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.580
the data anymore.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.180
Yeah.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:04.760
Fantastic.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.400
Just know how to work

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.540
with NumPy

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.920
like X-Array

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.200
stuff in your notebook

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.660
and that's all

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.200
you got to know.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:11.940
Yeah.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.080
It's all built

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.040
around pandas

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.760
and NumPy

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.720
and like

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.380
if you want to

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.360
like

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.720
let me find

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.200
a really

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.780
easy example

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.880
like what if

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.760
I want to plot

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.720
the data set.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.200
You know

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.680
I just type

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.360
dot plot

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:26.900
right?

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.680
Oh wow.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.640
And then it like

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.500
labels everything

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.320
and you understand

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.180
what you're looking at

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.200
and what day it is

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.040
and you can use

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.520
cell and ice cell

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.620
and just sort of

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.360
like pandas.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.120
It almost looks

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.780
like an ocean

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.680
just right there.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.240
It's

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:39.560
yeah.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.960
Longitude and then

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.480
I guess

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.280
temperature right?

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:42.880
Yeah.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.820
And so this is

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.940
like you just

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.600
typed plot

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.320
and it actually

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.340
tells you exactly

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.380
what you're doing

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.500
and what it's plotting

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.820
and what the color bar

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:51.420
so what do these

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.560
different colors mean?

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.020
And you know

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:54.700
you could do

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.840
a spatial plot

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.580
like this

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.500
where you do it

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.200
in time

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.940
or let's just

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.060
pick a particular

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.260
latitude and longitude

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.240
and the nice thing

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.000
is that you can

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.020
actually just tell it

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:06.540
your latitude

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.240
and longitude

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.420
and you can use

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:08.960
Google Map

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.600
to look up your

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.660
latitude and longitude

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.840
and then plot it

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.320
and it says

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:12.720
oh I'll make

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.460
a time series.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.480
That's pretty cool.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.040
Wow.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.000
Yeah I remember

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.780
just struggling so much

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.020
getting into programming

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.700
and having to work

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.020
with custom file formats

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.700
out of like research projects

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.020
you're like

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:23.720
what do you mean

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.200
I have to read

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.280
this binary file?

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.340
This is going to be so hard.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.300
Okay here we go.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.940
Yeah and then like

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.160
you wanted to read

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.780
a different binary file

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.300
like start from scratch

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.460
write all that code again

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.820
and like X-ray

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.480
sort of took

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.340
all of the

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.360
back end work

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.240
that all the people

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.060
at the data archives

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.900
did with like

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.700
getting everything

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.660
in the same format

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.380
and labeling

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.460
all the data nicely

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.420
it sort of

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.540
took all that work

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:46.880
and just said

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.360
well we'll write

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:47.980
one library

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:48.540
that builds

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.140
on all of that

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.940
and can read anything.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.120
Yeah awesome

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.800
great recommendation.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.320
A couple of pieces

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.740
of real-time follow-up

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.900
Sam Morley

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:56.920
out in the live stream

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.360
says X-ray is great

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.040
I did an example

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.720
of using it

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.660
to open a net CDF file

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.200
in my book

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.620
and I'm learning

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.180
about his book

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:04.980
Applying Math

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:05.460
with Python

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.720
Practical Recipes

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.960
for Solving Computational

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.620
Math Problems

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.920
Using Python Programming

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.560
and its Libraries

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.220
that's awesome.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.280
That looks like fun

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:12.640
actually.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.600
Yeah it does.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.320
Yeah and X-ray

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.940
linked to like SciPy

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.740
and it has all

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.180
a lot of statistics

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.540
and math built into it

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.320
so you can actually

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.100
compute trends

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.780
in one line

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.380
and all of that.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.420
Yeah nice.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:24.940
Cool.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.980
I also have one

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.140
other piece of follow-up

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:27.460
here Brian

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.060
I don't want to

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.260
panic you all

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.560
but right here

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:31.800
in Portland

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.420
we have Panic

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.360
the software company

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.100
and I just want

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:34.960
to give a quick shout out

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.400
to this thing

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.640
called Transmit here.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.000
This is what I actually

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.740
use to get stuff

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.540
up into

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.280
and out of S3

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.200
and it also

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.920
will let you talk

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.520
to Backblaze,

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.100
Box,

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.380
Dropbox,

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.400
Azure,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.180
Google Drive

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:47.960
all these places

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.420
as well

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.220
and it's basically

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.000
like an old school

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.060
FTP program

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.940
where like on one half

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.720
it has your computer

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.480
and the other half

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.200
it has whatever

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.480
cloud storage

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.140
is that you're

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.640
working with there

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.140
and maybe you could

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.000
even put the other half

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.800
not just your computer

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.540
but somewhere else

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:01.780
as well.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.240
So if you want

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.060
just like a UI

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.480
not something like

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:04.960
R clone

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.900
but just a UI

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.160
I'd strongly recommend

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.560
this thing.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.300
They don't sponsor

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:08.900
the show or anything

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.500
but I definitely love it.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.120
I use it all the time.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.600
Neat.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.060
Neat.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:12.680
All right.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.180
Am I up next actually?

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.480
I guess I am.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.140
Yeah.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:16.940
I think so.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.680
I am.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:17.960
I am.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.820
Number four

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:19.980
would be

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.380
I want to talk about

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.500
this announcement

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.540
from JetBrains

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.660
being one of the bigger

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.340
tool companies

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:26.920
tool builders

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.320
for the Python world.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.460
They came up with this thing

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.360
called JetBrains

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.280
remote development

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.720
and buried at the end of this

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.760
is actually what I think

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.720
is the lead

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.920
got quite buried here

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.400
but we'll see.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.420
So they introduced something

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.500
that I was not aware of

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.920
called remote development.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.140
So the whole idea of this

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.840
is basically

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.700
what if

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.940
instead of running

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.220
like PyCharm

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.440
this works for any

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.180
of the IntelliJ stuff

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.080
but let's say PyCharm

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.100
instead of running PyCharm

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.440
locally on your machine

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.460
you could just

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.640
give it an SSH

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.340
destination

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:57.840
let's say

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.280
and it will go over there

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.740
and run PyCharm

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.140
the server

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:02.980
or the sort of

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.420
logic bits over there

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.600
but just have a light

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.120
front end

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.360
to your computer

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.000
here.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.020
so like a lightweight

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.240
if you're on

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.940
some really wimpy laptop

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.300
and you wanted to

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.080
access

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.520
like a better server

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.200
at work

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.240
or in the cloud

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.000
or

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.440
in like Shell's example

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.460
near some massive data set

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.360
instead of far away

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.600
from some massive data set

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.160
so you could just

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.400
directly talk to it

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:25.860
and so on.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.860
So yeah

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.720
it's super cool

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.440
you just basically

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.680
give it some SSH thing.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.540
They also say

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.580
it's good for things

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:32.940
like

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.040
if your laptop

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:34.920
gets stolen

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.320
what data goes with it

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:36.780
you know

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.320
if you just

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.100
keep the data

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.740
somewhere else

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.180
right

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.880
then like

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.180
just revoke

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:41.940
the SSH key

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.680
and nothing's

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.440
nothing's bad.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.660
You can also set it up

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.620
so that it'll create

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.200
pre-configured environments

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.780
like

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.280
when you connect to it

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.340
it'll automatically

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.000
give you

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.080
something with like

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:52.460
let's say

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.220
Conda setup

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.040
and all the right

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.320
libraries pre-installed

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.280
and that one weird

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.140
C thing

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:57.440
you gotta

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.080
you know

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.700
apt install

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.160
to make sure

00:19:59.160 --> 00:19:59.580
it works like

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.520
it starts with that

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.260
just all configured

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.160
from different things.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.480
So anyway

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.100
that seems all

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:03.820
pretty cool to me.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:04.660
I thought it was

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.280
pretty neat.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280
That does look neat.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.840
I think it's free

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.440
if you set up

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.140
your own server

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.360
but then I think

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:10.960
it costs money

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.040
if they provide you

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.480
the server

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.060
right

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.000
so kind of just like

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.880
firing up a VM

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.680
for you on your behalf.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.220
All right

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.200
you ready for the buried lead?

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.420
Scroll, scroll

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.140
so here you can see

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:19.620
this is an example

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.140
of just like

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.380
connect over SSH

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:21.900
or you can go to

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.140
JetBrains space

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.060
and they'll create

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:24.620
one for you

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:24.960
right

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.700
but here's the buried lead

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.800
they announced this thing

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.980
called JetBrains fleet

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.460
which is

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.620
as far as I can tell

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.100
unrelated

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.320
I think it'll connect

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.940
one of these things

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.680
but is

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680
is another

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.460
thing

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:35.980
so if you click

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.600
down at the bottom

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.460
or is there something

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.200
about learn more

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.460
and if you go to this

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.620
it is a

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.540
complete

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.500
rewrite

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.020
of the whole

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.980
IDE story

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.040
over at JetBrains

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.080
and basically

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.240
think VS Code

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.100
but from JetBrains.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.720
Yeah

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.380
I'm interested

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.520
in watching this

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.700
and I just heard

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.860
about this last week

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.940
and they're doing

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.980
it an invite only

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.440
sort of

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.680
not invite only

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.520
but you have to like

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.300
early access

00:20:59.300 --> 00:20:59.940
get approved

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.420
sort of thing

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:00.600
yeah

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.080
get approved

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.580
sort of thing

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.460
they're trying to limit

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.840
basically limit the feedback

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.720
so that they can

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.840
deal with the feedback

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.100
so

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:07.640
yeah

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.360
so it's like

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.760
super fast to open

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.600
it doesn't have

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.560
a project structure

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.340
in the same sense

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.260
that like PyCharm

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.820
or IntelliJ would

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:15.780
it just opens files

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.140
and it doesn't even have

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.620
the IDE features

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.340
unless you click

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:19.980
this little like

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.160
make it smarter button

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.040
and then it'll like

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:22.700
fire up

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.600
all the high-end

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.520
stuff that takes

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:24.740
you know

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.740
five seconds to start

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.460
the other thing

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:26.760
that's cool

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.140
as you can see

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:27.500
on the screen

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:27.760
right here

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.300
is there's like

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.320
three people typing

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.520
all at the same time

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:30.940
actually no

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.240
there's five people typing

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.200
so it's like

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:33.900
Google Docs

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.620
where you can all

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.000
like collaborate on it

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.720
in parallel

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.080
like right within it

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.320
so

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.760
I think those are all

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.740
super neat developments

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.780
in the whole editor space

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.460
which you know

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.300
we all write a lot of code

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.000
and kind of deal

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.560
with these tools

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.980
editor as a service

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.420
is something

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.440
that is happening

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:48.980
and I'm

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:49.420
it

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.300
it

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.200
is a hard thing

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:51.840
for me to wrap

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.440
my head around

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.580
because my brain

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.100
thinks I want

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.040
all my editor stuff

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:55.420
locally

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.460
but there's a lot

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.260
of times where you don't

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:57.680
so

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.160
yeah

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.260
I just like the group

00:21:59.260 --> 00:21:59.600
Cody

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.580
yeah I know

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.300
I think that's really

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:01.960
neat as well

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.720
I think that would be

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.420
really valuable

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.380
to some people

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.280
on teams

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:05.900
instead of

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.400
you know

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:06.920
we've all been

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.780
in those screen share

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.040
meetings

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:08.400
like no

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.060
could you go over there

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:09.960
could you type this

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.540
no no no no

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.160
not after that

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.580
but inside the parenthesis

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.320
it's like please

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:13.680
no

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.820
that's exactly

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.440
what's going to do

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:16.920
it

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.100
to the left

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:18.360
no

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.280
a little bit more

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:19.800
to the left

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.680
exactly

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.260
and so

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.060
wait not a friend

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.240
yeah

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:25.820
yeah

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.740
let's see

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.480
a bunch of people

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:27.980
out there

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.320
really like this

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.080
RJL

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:31.960
and Sam

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.860
and so on

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.220
but

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.360
Kim has an interesting

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:34.720
comment

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.720
we've come full circle

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.140
ish

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:36.880
back to

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.980
talking to the one

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:38.840
mighty mainframe

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.460
over a lightweight

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:39.960
terminal

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.600
circa

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.720
1985

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.380
or

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:42.700
you know

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:42.980
for me

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:43.380
90

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:43.680
like

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.480
95

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.280
and like

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.020
X11

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.860
Xwindows

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.080
like

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.720
is your Xwindows

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.840
set up so you can talk to the server

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.540
yeah

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.060
yep

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.800
I'm just thinking the same thing

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.840
yeah

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.440
definitely

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.380
but these are interesting ideas

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:55.940
you know

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.820
for me personally

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.920
I love to use PyCharm

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.100
for working on projects

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.360
but if I've got just a

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.500
JSON file

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.020
or even a Python file

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.260
and I just want to look at the file

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.620
I probably won't open it in PyCharm

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.060
because it's going to create all this project

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.600
goo

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.020
that's going to be stuck in that folder

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.240
and it's going to expect

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.180
it's going to complain

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:11.920
there's no interpreter

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.660
I just want to look at it

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:12.880
you know

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.860
and so tools like this

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.060
I think are going to be really neat

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:15.520
yeah

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.060
yeah

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.440
and

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.240
Brandon's support

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.100
suggesting something crazy out there

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:20.820
like mobs

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.720
might run in

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.220
and no

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.020
mob programming

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.140
where you like working as a group

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:24.800
I think it's fun

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.420
yeah

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.160
and I'll be

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.820
we should play with this though

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.360
yeah

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:29.800
I think

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.060
it'd be fun to see

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.080
what all the interactions

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.820
feel like

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.220
and stuff

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.500
I totally agree

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.020
yep

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.500
alright

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.120
over to you

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.400
you know

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.660
I'm trying to remember

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.700
how I came across

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.600
the XY problem

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.380
and

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.120
and I was

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.140
doing some research

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:44.700
last week

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.260
and

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.040
and

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.280
I think I was down

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.080
some rabbit hole

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.620
of link

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.220
follow link

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:49.800
follow link

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.400
sort of thing

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.460
and I ran across

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.480
this problem

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.120
and

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.520
the XY problem

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.160
and

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.220
probably everybody else

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.080
knows about this already

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.780
but I

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.220
it was

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.340
the concept

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.320
was new to me

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:00.820
and I

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.080
yeah

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:01.460
I don't know

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.140
the XY problem

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.740
okay

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.780
and I studied math

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.300
come on

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.020
well so

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:06.840
it

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.620
isn't

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.760
really that mathy

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.080
but

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.140
so the XY problem

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.320
is essentially

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.640
you

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.960
is

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.820
is

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.720
you're trying to solve

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.720
problem X

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.380
and you think of a solution Y

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.120
that would

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.420
help work

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.640
to solve that

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.320
and you

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.100
you get down to

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:25.720
trying to solve

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.860
all the details of Y

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.100
and you get stuck

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.660
so you ask about Y

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.740
but what you're really

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.680
trying to do is X

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.640
and it's

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.760
that's sort of nebulous

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.340
an example

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.700
kind of highlights it

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.200
so

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:36.560
and

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.120
we've got

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:37.800
this example

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.480
in the show notes

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.100
that I pulled out

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.000
of one of the links

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.280
is

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.180
how do I

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.560
if somebody asks

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.080
how do I

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.600
get the last three characters

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.340
of a file name

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.300
and somebody says

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:47.560
oh

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.640
you just like do

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.720
and this is a shell

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.360
command

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:50.800
you just

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.820
do like

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.520
if it's in the variable

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:53.900
foo

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.720
you just do

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.200
dollar

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.240
curly bracket foo

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.100
and then do a colon

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.000
and then negative three

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.600
just grabs the last three characters

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.180
but

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:01.960
also

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.380
why do you want

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.340
the last three characters

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.260
is it because you

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.580
are trying to do

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.060
trying to pull off

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:08.660
the extension

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.540
somebody goes

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.600
yeah that's what I'm trying to do

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:10.960
and they're like

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.040
oh well then you don't want

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:12.900
the last three characters

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.280
because it might be a two character

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.600
or a four character extension

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.040
so teach them how to do

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.480
the real problem

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.160
and

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.780
in one of the

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.400
I'm going to link to a couple

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.280
a couple

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.420
like forum

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.640
answers and stuff

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.140
in there

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:26.720
because

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.600
I think it's

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.320
interesting

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.080
there's a lot of

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:30.980
verbiage around

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.820
the XY problem

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.440
that sort of

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.760
blames the asker

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.400
for asking a stupid question

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.220
and I think it's important

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.040
to not do that

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.600
because

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.260
we do this all the time

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.140
we break problems

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:41.720
in software

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.180
we break problems down

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.460
if I want to do A

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.620
then I need to do B and C

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.760
but to do B

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.780
I got to do D and E

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:48.560
and then

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.460
and then also F and G

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.180
and then

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.440
way down

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.600
into the rabbit hole

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.840
I get to get into

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.040
the X and Y problem

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.340
but how far back

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.360
do you back up

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.000
to give enough context

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.920
to somebody else

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.040
so it's hard to avoid

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.380
you'll run into it

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.580
and then I

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.420
I really like

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.360
there was one forum

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:07.920
that had

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.420
some great advice

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.000
both on asking questions

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.460
and on answering questions

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.040
so when asking questions

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.920
state the problem

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.780
that you're trying to solve

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.680
but also

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.320
state the higher

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.520
level thing

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.520
that you're trying to achieve

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.760
if appropriate

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.960
and then also

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.120
how that fits

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.140
into the wider design

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:25.620
and then

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.240
it also brought up

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.160
if you've thought

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.200
of other solutions

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.960
that you've

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.160
eliminated

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.460
for some reason

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:34.880
or another

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.560
go ahead and list those

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.020
because

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.040
somebody might

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.120
give you one of those

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:39.700
as an answer

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.220
and you've already

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.040
eliminated that

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.360
so give the reason why

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.480
and then

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.880
I think what's most important

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.360
is giving answers

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.120
to what

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.240
XY problems

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.020
or giving answers

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:49.540
to problems

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:49.980
because

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.880
although

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.760
I think

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.420
everyone

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:52.840
that's

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.220
that's

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.040
on this podcast

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:54.960
and also listening

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.360
is probably

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:56.900
an expert

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.760
in some fields

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.440
and a novice

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.100
in other fields

00:26:59.100 --> 00:26:59.840
so we're going to be

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.440
on both sides

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:00.960
of the fence

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.340
so when answering

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.040
questions

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:03.780
and you think

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.940
oh somebody's just

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:05.900
trying to get the extension

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.800
I'll just tell them

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.380
how to do that

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.100
that's not

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.080
necessarily helpful

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.820
so a great

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.580
there's a great

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.220
three-part

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.340
thing to do

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.620
and our example

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.820
follows those

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.760
is go ahead

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.080
and answer

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.700
the question

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.380
directly

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.380
but also

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.160
ask some questions

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.160
about the problem

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:22.600
say

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.540
just curious

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.520
why are you

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.520
trying to do this

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.340
is it because

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:26.760
you're trying

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.220
to do this

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:27.780
other thing

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.940
if so

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.460
you're

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:29.900
the thing

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.540
I just told you

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.000
might not be

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.360
appropriate

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.140
and then

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.280
once you figure

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:33.940
out really

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:34.880
what the real

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.860
problem is

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.640
then

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.500
you can help

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.480
and give

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.340
the final answer

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:39.880
so

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.900
it isn't

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.160
helpful

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:41.620
to just

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:41.880
say

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.280
oh you're

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:42.460
probably

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:42.800
getting the

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.160
extension

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:43.580
go ahead

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.040
and just

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.480
do that

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.460
anyway

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.100
I thought

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:46.460
this was

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.060
an interesting

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.400
thought process

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.580
around answering

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.060
and asking

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:50.700
questions

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.540
yeah absolutely

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.060
it seems to

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:53.400
be very

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.000
relevant to

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.620
stack overflow

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:55.400
type places

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.220
because you're

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:56.380
going to

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:56.560
pose

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:56.880
you're looking

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.360
for help

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:57.840
you say

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.100
I'm trying

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:58.340
to do

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:58.640
this

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.540
but a lot

00:27:59.540 --> 00:27:59.800
of times

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.320
people will

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:00.920
and it'll

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.180
give you

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:01.860
very specific

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.320
answers

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.380
and the answer

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:03.860
could be

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.440
well why don't

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.280
you do this

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.020
library that

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.860
already understands

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:07.420
that format

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.260
like Shell

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:08.840
mentioned

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.200
earlier

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:09.540
like why

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:09.680
don't you

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.220
use x-ray

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:10.720
instead of

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.160
trying to

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.640
understand

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.120
how to

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:12.740
parse this

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.120
thing

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.880
just use

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.120
that

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:14.700
oh well

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.100
that's

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:15.560
way better

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.140
thank you

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.060
I see

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:17.800
that a lot

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.920
on stack overflow

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.680
that exact

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.020
it reminds me

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:21.720
also of my

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.460
like when I

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.440
went to school

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:23.880
and you're

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.540
trying to ask

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.240
a question

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:25.540
to your

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:25.980
professor

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.760
or to get

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.100
help on

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.400
anything

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:27.620
right

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:27.900
you're like

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.340
this is my

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:28.620
problem

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.640
what really

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.140
is your

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.540
problem

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.440
please tell

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:31.900
me about

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:32.240
it

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.040
and like

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:33.360
that's

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:33.720
that's

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.000
what you're

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.320
asking

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:34.620
right

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.440
like tell

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:35.780
me what

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.280
the actual

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:36.760
problem

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.060
is

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.420
and if you

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:37.920
can do

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.300
that

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.040
clearly

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.780
you're

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:39.900
going to

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.120
get a

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:40.280
much

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:40.500
better

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:40.800
answer

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.360
yeah

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.000
absolutely

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.780
and a lot

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.060
of people

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:43.880
just don't

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.240
I mean

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:44.780
it's also

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:45.380
just a

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:45.940
different

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.760
perspective

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.220
thing

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:47.580
they know

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:47.800
that

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.200
they know

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:48.640
they have

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.080
the toolbox

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.620
of things

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:49.900
they know

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.120
how to

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:50.500
solve

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.140
and ways

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:51.420
they've

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:51.680
solved

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:51.860
them

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:52.460
and if

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:52.700
a new

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.100
problem

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:53.680
and this

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.000
is a

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.320
related

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:54.780
thing

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.040
is

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:55.620
people

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.460
don't

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:56.980
sometimes

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.280
don't

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:57.480
even

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.080
think

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.320
that

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:58.600
there's

00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:58.980
a really

00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.400
simple

00:28:59.400 --> 00:28:59.820
solution

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.280
out there

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:00.580
like

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.240
oh that

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:01.440
tool

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:01.640
you're

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:01.940
using

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.200
it

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:02.420
already

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:02.820
has a

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.180
flag

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:03.380
that

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:03.660
does

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.140
exactly

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:04.460
what

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:04.620
you

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:04.960
want

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.420
but

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:05.560
you

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:05.740
didn't

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:05.880
know

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.260
the flag

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:06.640
was there

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.060
so

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:07.980
it took

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.300
me

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:08.680
when I

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.040
started

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.440
learning

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.080
Python

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.840
and I

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.300
was so

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:11.780
used to

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.160
Fortran

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:12.500
77

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:12.980
where there

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:13.360
was never

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:13.860
any help

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.200
they just

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.560
don't even

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:14.860
try

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.240
that

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:16.820
when I

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.000
started

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.240
learning

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:17.640
Python

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.020
it

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:18.480
took

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:18.700
three

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:18.840
or

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:18.980
four

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:19.280
months

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:19.640
before

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:19.880
I

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.240
finally

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:20.460
just

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:20.700
said

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.320
anything

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:21.580
I

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:21.800
want

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.160
to do

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:22.940
someone

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.240
has

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:23.500
done

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:23.880
better

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.200
and they

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.600
are out

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:25.920
there

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.140
I

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:26.400
just

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:26.620
have

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:26.760
to

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.040
find

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.220
out

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:27.460
how

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:27.660
to

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.000
ask

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.220
the

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:28.680
question

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.280
correctly

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:29.520
to

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:29.940
find

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.260
them

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:30.780
because

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.040
it's

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:31.360
true

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:31.640
like

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.080
everyone

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:32.400
is

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.160
most

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:33.460
people

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:33.680
have

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.260
tried

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:34.480
to

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:34.720
solve

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:34.920
the

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.100
same

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:35.460
problem

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:35.740
there's

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.000
someone

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.260
out

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:36.400
there

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:36.600
who's

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:36.880
worked

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.020
on

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:37.160
the

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.340
same

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:37.720
problem

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:37.980
in

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.360
all

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.120
likelihood

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.700
yeah

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:39.960
there's

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.120
so

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:40.300
many

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:40.740
libraries

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.080
with

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.320
PIP

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:41.500
or

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:41.780
Conda

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.300
that

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:42.460
you

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:42.680
can

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.220
if

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:43.380
you

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:43.500
knew

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:43.620
it

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.860
existed

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.520
exactly

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:46.780
yeah

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.600
exactly

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.180
all

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:49.380
right

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.300
okay

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:50.640
so I

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:50.800
guess

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.160
I'm

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.560
am I

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:51.900
next

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.200
you

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:52.380
are

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:52.780
next

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.580
okay

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.100
so

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:54.740
what

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:54.900
I

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.200
wanted

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:55.420
to

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:55.700
show

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.160
this

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.140
library

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:57.780
that

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.260
is

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:58.620
called

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.300
Kerchunk

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.740
it's

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.100
a great

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:01.380
name

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:01.960
yeah

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.660
brand

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:02.900
new

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:03.260
so can

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:03.560
you see

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.100
my snail

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.400
screen

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:04.680
yeah

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:04.920
yeah

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.060
so

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.040
we had

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:07.240
this

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:07.680
problem

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.160
where

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.160
like

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:09.360
as

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.240
all

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:14.480
these

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:14.720
different

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.080
files

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:15.300
onto

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:15.480
the

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:15.760
cloud

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.540
and

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.040
then

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.160
it

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.380
turned

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:17.620
out

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:17.840
that

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.460
access

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.020
in

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:19.480
S3

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:19.720
was

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.120
really

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.400
really

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:20.840
slow

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.960
and

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.200
so

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:22.520
people

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:22.740
got

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:22.980
really

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.580
frustrated

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.520
because

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:24.700
like

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:24.840
the

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.080
cloud

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:25.200
is

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:25.320
supposed

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:25.440
to

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:25.580
be

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:25.940
fast

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.220
right

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:26.440
this

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:26.560
is

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:26.660
going

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:26.780
to

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.200
transform

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:27.740
science

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:27.960
we're

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.040
going

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.100
to

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:28.240
do

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:28.380
it

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:28.660
better

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.020
now

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.500
that's

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:29.600
the

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:29.940
promise

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.300
yeah

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:30.840
that's

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.000
the

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.480
promise

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.700
but the

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.000
grass

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.300
isn't

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:33.680
always

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.380
greener

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.280
so

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:35.640
this

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:35.800
is

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:35.980
this

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.440
library

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:36.980
that

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.100
I

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.480
think

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.020
has

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.240
really

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:38.760
maybe

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:38.980
some

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.400
broad

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.060
applications

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:40.460
it's

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:40.960
being

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.400
developed

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:41.740
right

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.120
now

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.040
and

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:43.840
the

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.600
idea

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.020
behind

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:45.200
it

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:45.340
is

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:45.520
like

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:45.740
we

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.020
have

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:46.180
all

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.360
these

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:46.740
data

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.240
formats

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:47.440
that

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:47.560
we're

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:47.720
sort

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:47.820
of

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.120
stuck

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.360
with

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:48.820
lots

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.000
of

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.360
data

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:49.840
but

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.160
sometimes

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.400
it's

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:50.600
slow

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:50.760
on

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.180
S3

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:51.420
so

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:51.560
is

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:51.700
there

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:51.840
a

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.000
way

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:52.200
that

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.320
we

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:52.500
can

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:52.840
fix

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.300
this

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.040
and

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:54.400
the

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:54.760
idea

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.240
is

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:55.560
that

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.040
you

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:56.440
create

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:56.680
a

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.180
reference

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:57.620
file

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.200
system

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:58.760
and

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:58.940
so

00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.100
you

00:30:59.100 --> 00:30:59.300
do

00:30:59.300 --> 00:30:59.540
this

00:30:59.540 --> 00:30:59.740
by

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.020
going

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:00.180
to

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:00.400
each

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:00.480
of

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:00.580
your

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:01.060
files

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:01.600
and

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:01.780
just

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.100
taking

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:02.340
the

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:02.600
data

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:02.760
that

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:02.900
you

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:03.340
need

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:03.920
for

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.240
that

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.540
file

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:04.760
like

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:04.920
just

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.100
the

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:05.480
metadata

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:05.820
so

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.100
like

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:06.500
what

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:06.940
size

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:07.120
is

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:07.400
it

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:07.580
what

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:07.780
its

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.240
dimensions

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:08.500
and

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:08.840
coordinates

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.400
are

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:09.660
what

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.200
variables

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:10.460
does

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:10.580
it

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.000
contain

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.540
so

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:11.660
you

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:11.820
just

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.040
take

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:12.260
those

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:12.420
little

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:12.960
bits

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.500
and

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:13.980
pull

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.140
them

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:14.300
out

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:14.500
into

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:14.640
a

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:14.880
JSON

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.320
file

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:15.820
and

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:15.920
so

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.100
then

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:16.220
you

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:16.400
have

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:16.700
this

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.460
reference

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:17.900
file

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.120
that

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:18.360
just

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:18.780
contains

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.080
the

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:19.600
important

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.100
information

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:20.340
but

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:20.500
it's

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:20.680
really

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.260
small

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:21.580
and

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:21.680
so

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:21.840
that

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.100
makes

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:22.240
it

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:22.620
faster

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:22.800
to

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.160
access

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.120
and

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:24.500
then

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.380
you

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:25.960
construct

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.200
this

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:26.560
JSON

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.220
file

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:27.880
and

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.360
I

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:28.500
have

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:28.680
some

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.120
benchmark

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:29.500
tests

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:29.660
in

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:29.860
here

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.120
but

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.680
then

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:30.900
you

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.280
construct

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:31.500
a

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:31.920
mega

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.260
JSON

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:32.780
file

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:33.280
and

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:33.400
you

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:33.800
basically

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.360
virtually

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.000
aggregate

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.500
all

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:35.660
of

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:35.780
your

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:36.200
data

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:36.880
so

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.200
that

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:37.720
in

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.000
one

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.500
call

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.160
again

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.420
you

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:39.580
can

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:39.740
just

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.000
get

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.440
access

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:40.700
to

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.240
everything

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.100
and

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:42.680
nice

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.680
because

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:43.900
you

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.080
might

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.260
not

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:44.440
need

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:44.820
actually

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.020
the

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.280
data

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:45.440
you

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:45.600
might

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:45.780
need

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:45.920
to

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.140
know

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.520
what

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:46.900
time

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:47.120
frame

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:47.300
is

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:47.560
this

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:47.740
so

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.060
do

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:48.200
I

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:48.560
need

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:48.700
to

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:48.860
read

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:49.000
in

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.140
that

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:49.460
file

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:49.660
or

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.000
not

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.340
right

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.060
yeah

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:51.780
and

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.360
in

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:52.700
some

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.120
ways

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:53.800
because

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.340
you're

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:54.640
doing

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.440
a lot

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:55.540
of

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:55.700
what

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:55.900
one

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:55.980
of

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.060
the

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:56.200
things

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:56.340
with

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:56.740
x-ray

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:56.980
back

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.120
to

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.240
that

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:57.480
other

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:57.900
library

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:58.120
is

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:58.260
that

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:58.600
does

00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:58.800
the

00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.120
lazy

00:31:59.120 --> 00:31:59.580
loading

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.120
so

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:00.280
like

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:00.420
this

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:00.560
is

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:00.740
a

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.140
16

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:01.600
terabyte

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:01.920
data

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.160
set

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:02.320
that

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:02.460
I'm

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:02.720
loading

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.040
here

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:03.640
but

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:03.980
I'm

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.200
just

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.920
loading

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.300
the

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:05.820
data

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.280
about

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:06.520
the

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:06.820
file

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.020
I'm

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.180
not

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:07.460
actually

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:07.820
loading

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:08.080
any

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:08.360
data

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:08.640
until

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:08.800
I

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:08.940
need

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:09.060
to

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:09.300
touch

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:09.500
it

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:09.900
and

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:10.040
so

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:10.180
I

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:10.320
can

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:10.680
load

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.100
this

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:11.960
giant

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.280
data

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:12.700
set

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.080
in

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:13.220
a

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:13.360
little

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:13.540
bit

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:13.880
over

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.520
less

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:14.720
than

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.000
two

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.440
minutes

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.020
by

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:16.240
doing

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:16.460
this

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:16.800
virtual

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.540
aggregation

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:17.760
with

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.160
KrippChunk

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:18.700
and so

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.060
all it's

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.280
doing

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:19.440
is

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:19.600
it's

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:19.840
reading

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.300
these

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.240
aggregated

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.860
JSON

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:22.540
files

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.300
and

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.120
right

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:24.440
now

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.000
it works

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.380
for

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:25.920
three or

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.140
four

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:26.540
different

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:26.880
types

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.040
of

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:27.260
data

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:27.560
sets

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:27.780
so

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:27.940
if

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:28.060
you

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:28.580
have

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.180
big

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:29.800
collections

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.740
of

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.480
data

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.000
that are

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.200
going

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.380
on

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:32.500
to

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.080
S3

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.800
they have

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.160
lots

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:34.340
of

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:34.600
different

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:34.860
little

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.280
files

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:35.600
this

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:35.740
is

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:35.900
a

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.120
way

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:36.320
to

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:36.560
sort

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:36.780
of

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.440
virtually

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:37.960
aggregate

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.200
them

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:38.440
into

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:38.800
one

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.300
big

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:39.580
data

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:39.880
set

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.040
that

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.180
you

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:40.360
can

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:40.640
then

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.160
subset

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:41.660
oh

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:41.940
that's

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.100
really

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:42.360
cool

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:42.640
it

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.820
seems

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.080
like

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:44.300
this

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:44.500
is

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:44.720
one

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:44.840
of

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.240
those

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:45.820
that

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.080
comes

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.340
as

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:46.560
part

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:46.640
of

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:46.780
the

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:47.420
FS

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:47.820
spec

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:48.580
project

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:48.820
which

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:48.960
we

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.220
talked

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:49.400
about

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:49.620
pretty

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:49.920
recently

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.200
as

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:50.460
well

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.060
yeah

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.420
and so

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:51.600
this

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:51.760
is

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:51.980
part

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:52.100
of

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:52.500
FS

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:52.960
spec

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.680
and

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.720
it's

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.320
kerchunk

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:55.760
it was

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:55.960
just

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.460
released

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:56.980
and

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.180
it's

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:57.280
a

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:57.560
unified

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:57.940
way

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.120
to

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:58.580
represent

00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.120
compressed

00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.440
data

00:32:59.440 --> 00:32:59.960
formats

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.540
and

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:00.680
it

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:00.900
creates

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.080
this

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:01.480
virtual

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:01.900
data

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.120
set

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:02.280
so

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:02.620
that's

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:02.920
where

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.420
it's

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.480
located

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.060
yeah

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:05.400
super

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:05.700
cool

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.280
see

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:06.620
Kim

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:06.900
has a

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:07.180
question

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:07.500
do you

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:07.760
keep

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.300
the

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:08.720
individual

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.040
JSON

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.520
files

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:09.800
with

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:09.960
the

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.220
data

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:10.880
you

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.340
can

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:11.760
so

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:11.940
the

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:12.200
nice

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.420
thing

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:12.680
about

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.000
this

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.180
the

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:13.420
data

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:13.640
can

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:13.800
be

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.240
anywhere

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:14.760
and

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.020
again

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:15.220
this

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:15.380
is

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:15.680
idea

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:15.880
to

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.100
make

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:16.620
data

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.060
invisible

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.280
and

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:17.480
easy

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.080
you can

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.800
either create

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.500
them yourself

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.300
and just

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:26.780
keep the

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:26.960
little

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.300
JSON

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:27.880
files

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.280
public

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:28.820
and

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.180
then

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:29.480
you

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:29.820
just

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:30.160
make

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:30.520
the

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:30.820
one

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.440
aggregated

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:31.800
JSON

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.240
file

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:32.820
public

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:33.060
and

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:33.620
anybody

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:33.980
could

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:34.560
use

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:34.760
that

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.080
JSON

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.560
file

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:35.760
to

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.080
access

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:36.300
the

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:36.480
data

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:36.720
this

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:36.960
way

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.100
fantastic

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:38.500
that

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:38.720
looks

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:38.980
really

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.260
helpful

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:39.480
for

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:39.720
working

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:39.840
with

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.020
large

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.340
data

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:40.900
yeah

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.840
I think

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.000
it's

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:42.320
cool

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.040
it looks

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.280
awesome

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:43.660
all right

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.160
Brian

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:44.400
does that

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:44.700
bring us

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:44.920
to

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.140
the

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:45.660
extras

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.860
yeah

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.160
I guess

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:47.840
it does

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.760
how many

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.480
extras

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:49.820
you got

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.120
today

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:50.900
I just

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.500
have one

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.120
entertaining

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.500
extra

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:52.940
I thought

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.040
as

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.000
some

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.300
people

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.020
have amusingly

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:56.400
noticed

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.240
I am

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:57.900
attempting

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.260
to grow

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:58.640
my hair

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:58.860
out

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.060
and

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:00.600
I went

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:00.760
to

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.080
Florida

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:01.640
last

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:01.900
week

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.480
and

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:02.740
it's

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.120
very

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:03.480
humid

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:03.700
in

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.020
Florida

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.860
and

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.520
I

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:05.820
looked

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.060
like

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:06.300
a

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:06.580
cotton

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.080
swab

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:07.360
it

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:07.640
just

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:07.980
like

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.920
poofed

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.440
anyway

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.200
that's

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:10.540
it was

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:10.840
amusing

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.260
to me

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:11.700
but

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.540
you should

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:12.640
have

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:12.860
sent us

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.000
some

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.320
pictures

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:13.520
or

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:13.780
something

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:14.840
yeah

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.280
maybe

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:15.520
those are

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:15.880
the pictures

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.300
you don't

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:16.600
really

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:16.920
went out

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.040
there

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.240
but

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:17.500
yeah

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.040
yeah

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.360
so I

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:18.640
wish I

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:18.900
could have

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.140
seen

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:19.400
like

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:19.680
yeah

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.000
because

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.220
I was

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:20.380
at

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:20.960
Disney

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.200
World

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:21.440
and we

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:21.660
were doing

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:21.860
like

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.140
rides

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:22.540
and stuff

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:22.780
and I

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:22.980
really

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:23.620
wish I could

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:23.940
have seen

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.240
like

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:24.700
the

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:25.740
flowing

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.460
hair

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.460
on the

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.200
roller coaster

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:28.600
or something

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.120
like that

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.340
perfect

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.420
I

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:31.940
I

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:32.300
nice

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.120
let's

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:34.360
see

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:34.780
what

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.320
shells

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:35.560
got

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:35.920
first

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.500
okay

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.020
so

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:37.240
what

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:37.360
are

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:37.720
extras

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:37.980
just

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:38.240
something

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:38.420
that

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:38.540
we

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:38.720
did

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:38.980
last

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:39.160
week

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:39.480
well

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:39.660
just

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:39.940
whatever

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:40.120
you

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:40.260
want

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:40.340
to

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:40.600
also

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:40.860
just

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.000
give

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.120
a

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:41.320
shout

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:41.480
out

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:41.700
to

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:41.940
while

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:42.100
we're

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:42.280
here

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:42.500
before

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:42.760
we

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.260
call

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:43.480
it

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.740
I

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:44.940
think

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:45.120
I'm

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:45.340
pretty

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:45.680
good

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:45.880
I'm

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.080
really

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:46.540
excited

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.040
like

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.000
NASA

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:48.380
starting

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.020
a big

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.540
transformation

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:49.800
to

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.000
open

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.440
science

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:50.660
which

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:50.780
is

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.200
exciting

a new

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:52.940
they

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.280
announced

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:53.480
just

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:53.740
last

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:54.060
month

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.460
a new

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:54.780
40

try

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:56.400
and

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:56.600
help

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.100
scientists

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:57.440
move

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:57.820
to

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:58.180
open

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:58.660
practices

00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.440
and

00:34:59.440 --> 00:34:59.760
Python

00:34:59.760 --> 00:34:59.920
is

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.140
a big

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:00.380
part

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:00.480
of

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:00.980
that

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:01.320
because

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.200
a lot

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:02.300
of

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:02.460
this

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:02.740
was

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.260
the

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:03.540
open

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.020
community

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:04.420
that

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:04.960
Python

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.260
helped

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:05.680
develop

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:05.940
over

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.100
the

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:06.360
last

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:06.840
decade

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.180
and

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:07.380
all

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:07.520
of

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:07.680
the

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.200
tools

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:08.820
that

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.060
now

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:09.200
is

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.520
making

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.020
it's

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:10.160
not

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:10.380
just

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:10.780
science

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.160
easier

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:11.480
it's

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:11.760
making

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:11.920
it

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.160
easier

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:12.360
for

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:12.540
more

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:12.780
people

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:12.940
to

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:13.380
participate

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:13.620
in

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.060
science

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.160
I

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:15.360
think

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:15.580
there's

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:15.860
a lot

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.000
of

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.820
synergies

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.100
and

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:17.580
similarities

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.080
between

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.600
the

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.040
scientific

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.500
goal

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.920
and

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.160
open

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:23.520
source

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.080
yeah

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:24.520
because

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:24.680
it

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.240
used

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:25.360
to

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:25.560
be

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:25.780
like

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.280
scientists

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:26.520
like

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:26.620
you

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:26.760
would

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.020
share

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:27.180
your

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:27.460
knowledge

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:27.680
right

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:27.900
you'd

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.320
publish

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.060
paper

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:29.660
yeah

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:29.940
and

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:30.320
that

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:30.520
was

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:30.720
it

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:30.860
and

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:31.000
if

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.180
you

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:31.640
like

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:31.900
that's

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.000
what

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.340
graduate

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:32.540
like

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:32.680
I

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:32.900
remember

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.040
in

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:33.280
graduate

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:33.560
school

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.020
you

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:34.140
would

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:34.260
go

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:34.440
through

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:34.560
and

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:34.740
they'd

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:34.820
be

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:34.980
like

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.220
okay

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:35.900
derive

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.080
the

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:36.460
equations

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:36.660
in

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:36.800
this

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.120
paper

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.380
because

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:37.500
they

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:37.720
wouldn't

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:37.940
show

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.080
you

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:38.220
all

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:38.380
the

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:38.740
steps

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.540
and

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:39.720
you

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:39.860
would

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.040
do

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:40.340
that

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:40.620
and

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:40.880
if

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.000
you

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:41.160
wanted

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:41.340
to

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:41.540
code

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:41.640
it

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:41.840
up

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.100
you

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:42.280
would

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:42.520
just

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.100
open

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.280
up

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:43.400
a

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:43.540
new

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:43.840
window

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.060
and

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:44.300
start

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:44.660
coding

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.240
and

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:45.740
now

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:46.140
you

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:46.260
know

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.540
people

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:46.680
are

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:46.920
starting

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.100
to

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:47.380
publish

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:47.620
their

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.100
code

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:48.660
so

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:48.800
that

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:48.880
you

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.040
can

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:49.560
actually

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.300
reproduce

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:50.680
their

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.240
results

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:51.500
and

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:51.660
then

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:51.980
build

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.200
on

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:52.460
them

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:52.620
and

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:52.840
move

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.320
faster

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:53.680
and

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.300
the

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:54.860
whole

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.600
reproducible

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.000
science

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.280
thing

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:56.660
as well

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.220
fantastic

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:57.880
yeah

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.720
awesome

00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.800
Sam

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.200
in the

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:00.440
audience

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:00.680
says

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.000
yes

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.400
more

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:01.680
open

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.240
reproducible

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:02.600
science

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:02.780
is

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:02.980
great

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.140
for

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:03.480
everyone

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.000
yeah

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.820
all

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:04.900
right

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.120
I got

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:05.300
some

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:05.560
extras

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.140
as well

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:06.500
as you

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:06.640
can

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.120
imagine

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.040
surprise

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.860
I don't

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.100
remember

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:10.580
when I

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:10.980
was going

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.240
on

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:11.480
maybe

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:11.700
this

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:11.840
was

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.240
actually

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.000
in

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.400
talk

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:13.760
python

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:13.980
but I

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.240
was going

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:14.520
on and

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:14.840
on that

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.060
visual

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.340
basics

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:15.820
six

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:16.120
just

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:16.320
the

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:16.440
I

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:16.580
want

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:16.700
to

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.020
drag

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:17.280
a few

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:17.560
things

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:17.800
on the

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.100
screen

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:18.300
and

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:18.480
write

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:18.680
a little

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:18.840
bit

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:18.960
of

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.220
code

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:19.460
made

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:19.580
it

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:19.700
so

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:19.920
easier

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.100
for

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:20.320
people

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:20.460
to

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:20.620
build

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:20.940
apps

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.800
you

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:22.880
know

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.120
what

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:23.840
Kojo

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.080
is

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:28.440
this

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.200
replacement

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:29.780
thing

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.340
so

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:30.480
if

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:30.600
you're

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:30.800
trying

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:30.960
to

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.240
build

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:31.700
some

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.100
desktop

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:32.580
apps

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:32.980
and

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.060
you

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.200
want

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:41.180
to

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:41.860
try

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.040
to

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:42.240
work

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:42.420
on

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:42.580
some

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.000
integration

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.380
between

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:43.660
those

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:43.980
things

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:44.240
but

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.300
there's

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:45.480
a little

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:45.780
demo

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.060
where in

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.080
six

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:47.560
minutes

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.400
they build

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:48.680
a web

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.020
browser

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:49.780
which is

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.160
kind of

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:50.320
neat

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.720
so

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.280
very

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:51.740
visual

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.200
basic

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:52.680
feeling

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.320
so

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.120
is it

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.460
Python

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:54.700
it's

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:54.860
not

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.180
Python

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:55.920
no

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.080
it's

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:56.180
not

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:56.400
Python

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:56.600
it's

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:56.820
more

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.640
VB6

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.060
feeling

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:58.680
I don't

00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:58.780
know

00:36:58.780 --> 00:36:58.880
if

00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.020
it's

00:36:59.020 --> 00:36:59.280
actually

00:36:59.280 --> 00:36:59.780
VB6

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.000
which

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.140
is

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:00.340
even

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:00.660
worse

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:00.920
it's

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.080
sort

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.220
of

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:01.480
kind

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:01.880
of

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.020
but

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:02.180
not

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:02.560
exactly

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.800
I

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:03.980
just

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:04.120
did

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:04.220
a

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:04.620
webcast

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:04.800
10

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.040
reasons

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.180
you

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:05.440
love

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:05.800
high

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.060
charm

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:06.260
even

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:06.620
more

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:06.800
in

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.400
2021

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:07.960
with

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.260
jet

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:08.560
brains

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:08.860
and

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.680
Paul

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:09.880
ever

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.200
we

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:10.500
did

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.060
five

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:11.540
reasons

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:11.900
so

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.180
I'll

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:12.300
link

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:12.400
to

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:12.580
that

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:12.860
people

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.220
care

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:13.380
about

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:13.640
that

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.060
and

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:14.340
then

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:14.940
who

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:15.220
doesn't

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:15.440
love

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.700
a little

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.040

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:17.940
shock

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.420
and awe

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:18.780
and

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.660
being

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.340
I don't

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:21.560
know

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.260
outrage

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:22.540
I guess

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:22.720
is the

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:22.860
word

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:22.980
I'm

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:23.120

sort

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.120

00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.340
loans

00:37:59.340 --> 00:37:59.900
baked

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.240
into

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:00.380
the

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:00.680
browser

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.900
it's

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.500
insane

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.240
I know

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:04.480
it's

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:04.760
such

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:04.880
a

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.040
bad

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:05.360
idea

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:05.900
so

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:06.180
there's

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:06.360
an

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:06.900
article

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.400
it

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:07.540
says

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:07.860
users

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:08.380
revolt

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:15.380
this

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.000
all

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.260
feels

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:16.980
extremely

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.680
unnecessary

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.320
for a

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:18.700
browsing

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.540
experience

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.420
and

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:20.560
the

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.040
comments

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:21.440
are

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.000
you

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.220
go to

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:22.320
the

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:22.800
comments

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.100
they

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:23.500
are

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.480
really

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.520
there's

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.380
256

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.000
comments

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.280
which is

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:27.420
an

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:27.820
awesome

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:28.120
number

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:28.280
of

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:28.580
comments

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:28.740
for

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:28.860
the

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.200
moment

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:29.860
but

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.700
there's

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.080
just

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:31.720
almost

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.080
nothing

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:32.280
but

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:32.980
why

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.000
why

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.140
is

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:34.240
it

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:34.380
this

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:34.520
is

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.060
unbelievable

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:35.340
to me

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:35.440
I

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:35.740
can't

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:35.900
believe

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:36.100
this

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.280
is

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:36.700
so

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.020
it

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.400
makes

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:38.520
it

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:38.700
feel

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.040
so

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:39.540
shady

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:39.800
and

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.300
trashy

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:40.480
right

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:40.660
like

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:40.820
the

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.000
next

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:41.140
thing

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:41.300
you're

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:41.320
going to

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:41.480
do

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:41.620
is

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:41.780
get

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:41.980
like

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.380
bail

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:42.960
bonds

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.560
offerings

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:43.920
inside

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.100
your

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:44.480
browser

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:44.740
if

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:44.860
you

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.120
get

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.940
your

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.280
browser

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:46.500
just

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:46.900
weird

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.240
stuff

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:47.360
so

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:47.540
anyway

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:47.680
I

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:47.860
thought

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.200
people

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:48.420
might

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:48.760
enjoy

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.060
just

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:49.780
reading

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:50.000
through

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.320
this

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:50.620
and

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.640
taking

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.160
a

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:52.320
little

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:52.460
bit

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:52.540
of

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:52.700
that

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:52.920
in

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.400
it

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:53.720
it

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.280
must

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.020
work

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:55.460
right

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:55.700
because

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.420
we all

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:56.700
have

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:56.880
this

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.500
experience

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:57.740
where

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:58.000
you

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:58.540
I

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:58.660
mean

00:38:58.660 --> 00:38:58.880
there's

00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.060
been

00:38:59.060 --> 00:38:59.260
this

00:38:59.260 --> 00:38:59.380
has

00:38:59.380 --> 00:38:59.500
been

00:38:59.500 --> 00:38:59.660
going

00:38:59.660 --> 00:38:59.820
on

00:38:59.820 --> 00:38:59.940
for

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.220
20

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:00.640
years

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:00.900
like

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.100
with

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.420
their

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.160
browser

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:02.460
remember

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:02.640
it

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:02.800
used

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:02.900
to

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:03.240
install

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:03.520
all

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:03.720
this

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:03.980
stuff

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:04.120
on

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.220
your

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:04.560
machine

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:04.780
and

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.120
have

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:05.240
to

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:05.560
delete

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:05.700
it

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:05.920
all

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.400
and

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:06.540
then

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:06.760
that

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:06.940
was

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.200
really

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:07.560
illegal

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:07.700
so

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:07.840
they

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.100
had to

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:08.320
take

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:08.420
it

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:08.660
they had

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:08.820
to

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.420
separate

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:09.700
them

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.020
out

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:10.720
and

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.180
they

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:11.480
just

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:11.880
keep

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.360
finding

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:12.900
ways

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.100
to

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:13.320
get

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:13.760
back

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.100
in

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:14.760
yeah

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.080
there's

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.220
some

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:15.420
really

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:15.840
interesting

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.240
stuff

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:16.520
you know

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:16.860
they're

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.060
now

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:18.400
sort of

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:18.600
putting

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.160
ads

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:19.520
in

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:21.180
and

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:21.300
then

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:21.460
the

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:21.740
ads

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:21.860
are

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:22.120
forced

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:22.280
to

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:22.560
open

just

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:24.740
like

layers

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:25.460
of

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:25.640
like

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.340
why

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:27.160
it

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:27.200
it

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:27.360
makes

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:27.520
me

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:27.840
happy

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.420
that

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:28.620
I'm

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.000
not

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:29.700
11

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:29.840
at

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:29.900
the

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.100
moment

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.420
whereas

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:30.760
I've

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:30.960
been

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.580
looking

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:31.940
forward

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.080
to

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:32.340
using

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:32.940
the

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.180
new

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:33.620
terminal

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.220
and

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:34.900
oh my

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.280
posh

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:35.540
shell

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:35.720
on

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:36.020
Windows

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:36.460
which

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:36.720
looks

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.060
amazing

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:37.200
so

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:37.420
I think

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:37.620
there's

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:37.740
a

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.420
different

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.640
groups

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:39.920
this

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.060
is

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:40.460
definitely

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:40.620
a

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:40.820
different

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.120
group

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:41.320
than

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:41.640
the

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.140
VS Code

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:42.440
group

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:42.600
of

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.080
people

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:43.540
this

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:43.660
is

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:44.320
going to

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:44.540
take

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:44.700
us

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:44.920
back

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.120
to

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:45.860
1995

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.420
and

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:46.560
we're

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:46.700
just

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:46.880
going to

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:47.000
be

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:47.200
using

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:47.380
a

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:47.700
terminal

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.060
window

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:48.260
to

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:48.580
access

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:48.960
anything

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.240
so

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:49.380
we

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:49.520
don't

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:49.680
get

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.000
annoyed

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.240
by

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:50.400
all

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:50.580
this

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.340
there's

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:52.520
no

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:52.820

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:52.920

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.040
they

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:57.200
could

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:57.460
just

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:57.720
get

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.240
we

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.520
already

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:10.740
know

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:10.860
who

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:10.980
you

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:11.100
are

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:11.260
just

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:11.460
click

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:11.600
here

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:11.720
if

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:11.800
you

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:11.980
want

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.160
it

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.280
or

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:13.520
just

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:13.760
send

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:13.880
it

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.000
to

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.120
you

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:14.480
anyway

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:14.680
and

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:14.840
just

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.080
charge

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:15.220
you

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:15.540
later

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.900
exactly

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.180
so

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:19.280
I

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:19.420
feel

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:19.560
like

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:19.720
this

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.020
almost

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:20.200
could

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:20.300
be

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:20.440
the

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:20.620
joke

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:20.780
but

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:20.920
I've

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.040
got

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.160
a

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:21.400
different

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:21.720
joke

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:21.900
for

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:22.060
you

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:22.660
all

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.340
right

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:23.620
so

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.140
the

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:24.320
joke

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:24.460
for

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:24.600
this

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:24.880
week

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.220
comes

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:25.380
from

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:25.660
a

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.140
solid

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:26.560
source

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.480
xkcd

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:27.960
as you

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.080
may

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:28.240
know

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:28.440
this

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:28.560
is

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:28.760
about

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.500
workflows

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.020
and

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:30.480
changing

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:30.960
software

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.580
so

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:31.900
here's

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:31.960
the

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.060

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:32.200

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:32.460
says

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.000
workflow

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.720
and

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:33.940
it's

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.140
just

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:34.420
in

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:34.540
the

something

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.040
it

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:39.200
says

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:39.940
changes

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:40.280

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:43.980

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.320
when you

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:44.800
hold down

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.000
the

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.720
spacebar

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.320
and

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:46.480
then

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:46.740
there's

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:46.880
a

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:48.120
comment

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:48.420
it says

long time

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.120
user

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:49.740
writes

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:50.260
this

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:50.580
update

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:50.800
broke

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:50.980
my

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.340
workflow

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:51.620
my

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.200
key

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.340
is

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:52.540
hard

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:52.720
to

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:52.980
reach

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.280
so

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:53.460
I

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:53.680
hold

the

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:54.700
instead

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:54.940
and

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:55.100
I've

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:55.500
configured

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.020
emacs

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.500
to interpret

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.080
a rapid

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:57.520
temperature

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:57.880
rise

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.100
as

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:58.680
pressing

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.300
control

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.600
the

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:01.920
admin

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.160
writes

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:02.400
that's

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:02.980
horrifying

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.480
the

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:03.680
user

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.020
writes

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.300
look

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:04.560
my

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:04.860
setup

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.140
works

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:05.260
for

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:05.400
me

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:05.680
just

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:05.880
add

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.000
an

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.220
option

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:06.400
to

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:06.780
reenable

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.320
spacebar

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:07.680
heating

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.720
oh I

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.200
remember

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:11.660
like

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:12.060
enabling

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.460
all the

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:12.720
weird

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.160
emacs

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:13.460
things

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:13.680
that

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:13.900
only

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:14.080
you

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:14.200
would

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:14.380
know

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:14.740
about

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.940
exactly

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.660
and

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:18.900
the

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.400
subtitle

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:19.600
is

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.100
every

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:20.660
change

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:21.420
breaks

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:21.960
someone's

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:22.400
workflow

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.080
I love

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:23.320
it

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.200
yeah

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:24.900
actually

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:25.960
it's

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.460
interesting

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:26.840
because

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.380
python's

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:27.600
even

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:27.900
like

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.720
more so

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.120
like that

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.500
because

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.340
of the

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.060
introspection

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.660
and

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.180
everything's

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:32.880
really open

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.740
unless you

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.280
really work

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:34.760
hard to

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.180
make it

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:35.740
I mean

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.120
you can't

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:36.320
really

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:36.840
hide

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.300
too much

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:37.640
stuff

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:37.820
with

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.200
python

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:38.920
so

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.920
even

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.660
if

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:40.780
you

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.960
have

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.100
a

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:42.500
comment

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:42.840
around

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.020
a

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:43.320
function

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:43.560
or

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:43.700
an

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:44.000
access

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:44.360
point

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:44.560
to

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:44.780
say

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.840
this

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:45.980
is

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.120
not

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:46.320
part

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:46.380
of

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:46.480
the

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:46.800
API

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.180
this

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:47.340
is

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:47.600
subject

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:47.800
to

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.180
change

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:48.660
you

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:48.800
can

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.060
change

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:49.220
it

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:49.400
and

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:49.500
it

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:49.600
will

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:49.820
break

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.180
somebody

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:50.500
because

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:50.940
somebody

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:51.180
has

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:51.480
reached

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:51.940
inside

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:52.140
and

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:52.400
used

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:52.620
the

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:52.940
thing

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.360
you

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:53.560
told

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:53.700
them

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:53.860
not

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.000
to

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:54.260
use

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.220
yep

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:55.760
yeah

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.300
those

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:56.860
double

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:57.360
underscores

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:57.760
and single

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.260
underscores

00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:58.660
they're just

00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.040
there to

00:41:59.040 --> 00:41:59.380
slow you

00:41:59.380 --> 00:41:59.640
down

00:41:59.640 --> 00:41:59.880
but they

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.000
don't

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.260
that's

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:00.860
so you

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:01.260
notice

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:01.440
what

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:01.580
you're

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:01.840
not

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.160
supposed

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:02.340
to

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:02.520
do

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:02.760
those

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:02.900
are

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.020
where

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:03.160
the

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:03.640
interesting

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.040
parts

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:04.400
are

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.340
exactly

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:05.860
they

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:06.060
wouldn't

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:06.300
give me

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:06.420
the

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:06.660
feature

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:06.900
but I

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.000
can

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:07.140
just

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:07.240
do

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:07.360
it

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:07.520
right

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:07.800
here

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.220

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:09.420
well I

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:09.880
