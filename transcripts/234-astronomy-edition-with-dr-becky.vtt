00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly


00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.940
to your earbuds. This is episode 234, and it's May 19th, 2021. I'm Michael Kennedy.


00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.940
And I'm Brian Okken.


00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.940
And we have our special guest, Dr. Becky Smithers. Welcome.


00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.380
Hi, I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to introduce myself then. I was like, should


00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.380
I jump in? Should I wait?


00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.300
This is standard fare for our podcast. We do a bad job preparing our guests for jumping


00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.300
in. Welcome.


00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.380
- It's a casual podcast, they're my favorite to listen to


00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.100
and they're now my favorite to be a part of as well.


00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.140
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.340
Yeah, so it's really good to have you here


00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.260
and you're doing so many neat things out on the internet.


00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.340
First of all, you're an astrophysicist


00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.180
at University of Oxford. - I am.


00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.540
That is my day job, technically.


00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.740
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.960
You've written some books, you can tell folks about that.


00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.660
You are doing quite a bunch of interesting things


00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.420
over on YouTube, which is how I came to know you.


00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.860
Your work on YouTube is really neat.


00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.220
And yeah, maybe just tell people


00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.660
real quickly about yourself.


00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.540
- Yeah, sure.


00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.300
So I'm an astrophysicist.


00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.380
My day job is essentially to study supermassive black holes


00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.620
and figure out the effect that they have on their galaxies


00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.260
and how they might stop their galaxies from forming stars,


00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.980
which is kind of awesome.


00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.340
I'm living the dream that I had as an eight-year-old


00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.140
to become like a natural space scientist.


00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.980
And yeah, I just love talking about science and space


00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.860
with people as well.


00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.500
And I've sort of found my niche a little bit on YouTube,


00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.820
really, that I can put out videos each week


00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.940
about fun things in space, or even react to old sci-fi


00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.660
and stuff like that about what they got right


00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.940
and what they got wrong necessarily.


00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940
And it's just a great platform to communicate with people


00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.200
and respond to people's questions


00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.540
that they've never been able to Google.


00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.020
The tagline is your friendly neighborhood astrophysicist.


00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.500
- Yeah, I absolutely recommend that people check out,


00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.500
why that doesn't work.


00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.080
I absolutely recommend that people


00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.300
check out your YouTube channel, it is super neat.


00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.500
And yeah, there's a ton of fun videos there.


00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.020
There are very good sort of general science,


00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.520
just like interested in science,


00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.340
not scientists type of presentations.


00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.540
So super cool, super cool.


00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.880
All right, Brian, you got the first item, right?


00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.900
You wanna take it away?


00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.260
- Yeah, sure.


00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.440
Dustin Ingram just recently released an updated version


00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.440
of an article called "Powering the Python Package Index


00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.240
in 2021."


00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.120
Apparently there was one, I think,


00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.560
like in the name, Donald Stuff did one about five years ago


00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.120
to tell us how this was going on.


00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.080
So this is kind of amazing to read.


00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.200
There's just some cool information here.


00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.720
There were three maintainers,


00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.480
but it was mostly Donald five years ago.


00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.080
And now there are still three maintainers,


00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.080
but it's Donald, Ernest Durbin, and Dustin Ingram,


00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.540
all doing the maintainers, but there's also more people.


00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.120
So there's more people involved.


00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.960
There's five different moderators and three committers


00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.420
that help with the project.


00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.760
So that's the, and we've all seen it.


00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.120
It's just, people are using it a lot more


00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.840
And it's a it's more central part of our everyday life. So


00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.760
yes, what are some of the you know, I remember one of the


00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.920
really interesting things was just how much it costs to run


00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.480
pipe.ai.org in the whole like all the data transfer behind the


00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.680
scenes and stuff like that.


00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.520
Yeah, so let's let's jump to some of the data. The, the data


00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.280
that they showed was just sort of mind blowing. We've got one,


00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.600
We're up to 1.7 billion requests on PyPI per day,


00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.240
sometimes in 55.4 terabytes every day.


00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.120
That's like five times more than even from 2018.


00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.120
That's ridiculous.


00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.720
Yeah, so this is an amazing amount of data goes through there.


00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.360
And then they have data on files.pythonhosted.org.


00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.000
Also, there's some data on there.


00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The money that goes into it, Fastly takes care of a lot of the brunt of the work.


00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.600
So, Fastly apparently is donating about, what's the number?


00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.900
$1.8 million of services a month,


00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.900
if we were to have to pay for the Fastly services directly.


00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.000
Oh my gosh.


00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.800
And they give PyPI a 100% discount, so that's great.


00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.600
About $10,000 worth of services a month from Google and 7,000 from AWS,


00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.480
and then a whole slew of other people that help out too, like Datadog, which is cool.


00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.240
And then there's some other funding sources that we've had some grants,


00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.440
and we've talked about some of the grants that came through,


00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.000
but these are funding some amazing projects like the rewrite of PyPI,


00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.120
localization, some malware detection, which is really needed when everybody's depending on this.


00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.320
And now some support staff, they're hiring a project manager soon.


00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.920
Yeah, that's fantastic. Google came on as a visionary sponsor specifically to work on


00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.400
this and the security side of that, I believe.


00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.480
Yeah, one of the things I didn't know about, which we're


00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.080
going to provide a link to is the team maintains a


00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.400
thing called a fundables markdown page,


00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.680
which is a non-exhaustive wish list of large projects they'd like to see happen.


00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.480
>> Nice.


00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.680
>> It's looking for what are we going to do,


00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.360
but if we can do it,


00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.180
we'd like to do this. That's kind of neat.


00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.280
>> That's amazing. I'd never stopped to think about how much work


00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.880
and how many people must use PyPI.


00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.080
PyPI, I don't know how many, I say PyPI.


00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.360
But every time I type in pip now,


00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.960
I'm going to think differently.


00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.480
>> Just to say a little thank you.


00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.320
>> Yeah. Now I feel like I should go to this fundables list and


00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.360
give something back for all the types I've used it.


00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.440
Probably in frustration as well because


00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.580
something hasn't worked and not


00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.960
appreciated all the behind the scenes stuff.


00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.760
>> Yeah. The first time I learned about this,


00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.320
I was blown away at how much it takes to keep it going.


00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.640
Think about how much we all depend upon


00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.720
this as people working on Python.


00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.120
What if it went away tomorrow?


00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.960
- Yeah, it was terrible.


00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.260
- I can't even think about that.


00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.760
(both laughing)


00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.860
Most scientific research would probably collapse.


00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.700
So please don't.


00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.240
- You know what I wanted to ask you, Dr. Becky,


00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.320
is I suspect that you use Conda and Anaconda a lot


00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.680
in the data science space, or are you a pip person?


00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.500
- I'm a pip person.


00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.340
I don't really use Conda.


00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.600
Some of my colleagues do.


00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.180
It's all just personal preferences, really.


00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.200
I remember for a long time on the departmental computers,


00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.140
the ones that were owned by the physics department,


00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.520
they didn't give you install control,


00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.620
and so pip wouldn't work and it drove me insane.


00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.820
(laughs)


00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.660
- Oh wow.


00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.840
- I had to beg them to put pip on.


00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.900
I was like, no, you can only install like,


00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.200
software that has been approved,


00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.680
like by the IT department.


00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.920
And I was just like, oh God.


00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.960
- It's not gonna work.


00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.160
(laughs)


00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.360
- Yeah, that's really rough.


00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.200
All right, super cool.


00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.360
Well, I wanted to try to bring in


00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.120
some astronomy type things that have to do with Python,


00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.200
because of course you're here, Dr. Becky.


00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.760
And Shahran Ahmed, didn't really know


00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.400
that he contributed this to today,


00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.760
but just more of a general conversation item


00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.600
put out on Twitter, like,


00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.920
"Hey, I was looking for a Python generated star atlas,


00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.320
"like the Leuven star atlas."


00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.560
Have you heard of this thing?


00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.160
- No, I haven't.


00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.000
The Herschel star atlas is the most famous one,


00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.300
but I'm guessing Leuven is a bit of an update.


00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.240
- It's a project by...


00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.840
First off, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting their name.


00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.800
Let's see if I can, yeah, they just say,


00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.720
I have to go back and pull it up later.


00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.560
So they wrote this.


00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.000
I doesn't help me, I'm sorry.


00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.400
So it's the goal is to make a publication quality


00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.680
Stellar Atlas from scratch using Python.


00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.680
So it's pretty neat and the project's not finished


00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.760
and who knows what the timeline is on it,


00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.900
but I wanted to just give it a shout out more


00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.500
as a way to think about what are the tools that people are using for astronomy


00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.360
and Python and also just building maps.


00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.860
You know, maybe you want to build a map of something completely different.


00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.860
Maybe you're really into river floating.


00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.600
You want to build like amazing maps of like river floating or whatever.


00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.800
I think you could take the public data and like overlay the


00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.360
things kind of like they did here.


00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.280
So with this, I'll go and find some pictures down here at the end.


00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.920
It's, it's quite a long article talking about how all this works, but there's


00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.320
some really neat graphics that we can find.


00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.520
There we go.


00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.120
So they've got pictures of stars,


00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.160
variable stars, galaxies, nebula, planetary nebula,


00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.380
and all kinds of things that you might care about.


00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.440
Fast moving stars, I suspect a lot of those


00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.360
might be looping around black holes.


00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.360
What do you think?


00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.360
- I mean, yeah, you probably wouldn't see those


00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.600
astrometrically, but you'd probably get


00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.440
all sorts of variable stars that vary in brightness.


00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.120
- Yeah, yeah, they call those out,


00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.440
particularly with like a double circle type of icon.


00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.280
- Yeah, yeah.


00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.840
So astrometrically means like the astronomy position.


00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.300
So like incredibly precise.


00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.920
So those kind of like what you just described


00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.040
like a wobble from a black hole orbiting it,


00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.700
you probably wouldn't see on a starless like this.


00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.520
It'd be like too fine of a detail,


00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.360
like too much, too small of a change.


00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.240
Yeah.


00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.080
- Yeah.


00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.920
Well, so talks about how do you go and create this thing


00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.920
says there's a one plot map.py that's 1,500 lines long.


00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.680
trying to write all this together.


00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.080
They talk about using the different libraries.


00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.920
So it was NumPy for all kinds of data handling.


00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.120
It was PyLab and Matplotlib.


00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.640
So all the graphics that you see here


00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.400
are just layers of Matplotlib renderings


00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.920
over and over and over.


00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.680
Yeah, and then there was this library called BaseMap,


00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.120
which takes care of projections and transformations


00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.720
because I think one of the challenges was


00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.960
how do you project this onto paper?


00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.640
You know, when it's on, you know, a spherical thing.


00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.200
I think they said they used stereographic projections.


00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.040
I don't know.


00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.960
- I think it sounds about right, yeah.


00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.480
- That sounds right, yeah.


00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.040
SciPy, and then of course Astropy,


00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.720
which I know Dr. Becky used a lot, and then--


00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.240
- Round of applause for Astropy.


00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.080
- Woo!


00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.320
And PyEFEM for celestial coordinate transformations.


00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.320
So, yeah, a lot of neat,


00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.000
a lot of neat libraries on there.


00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.840
- Yeah.


00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.680
or use astropy?


00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.600
Like any of the others sound familiar?


00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.440
- All of them.


00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.800
I've used everything on one of those packages before,


00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.880
especially astropy.


00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.960
Like I have the same problem with like,


00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.920
I've taken an image with a telescope


00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.880
and it's been taken by a flat digital detector,


00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.920
but there's coordinates that are sort of overlaid on that,


00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.840
that come from the sort of the surface of a sphere.


00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.000
You can think of it as, right?


00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.040
And so you project that down using astropy


00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.120
and PyFM as well,


00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.000
'cause sometimes people work in different coordinates.


00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.640
So you can work in sky coordinates, which is sort of how high you are above the


00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.660
horizon and how far around you are.


00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.220
Or you can work in galactic coordinates, like with respect to the center of the


00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.660
Milky Way, like how far out are you and round and I don't ever work in those,


00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.120
but people, people who are Milky Way astronomers do, and then you've got to


00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.300
like, so some objects, their coordinates are given in Milky Way coordinates and


00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.340
not sky coordinates, so they'll have to have done so many transformations


00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.500
to get maps like this.


00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.600
What's cool about this map.


00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.340
It's the constellation Cygnus, if you can see that there.


00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.580
So that's the swan.


00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.300
It looks like a big cross in the northern sky.


00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.060
But that is the constellation or the area of sky


00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.380
that the Kepler space telescope stared at.


00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.220
- Oh, nice.


00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.420
So that's where the exoplanets have been discovered, yeah.


00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.260
- Pretty much, yeah.


00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.500
All of the exoplanets we know of,


00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.020
so some like 5,000 of them,


00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.660
will pretty much be in that patch of sky.


00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.540
So I'm really glad they chose that constellation


00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.460
to show in this piece. - Oh yeah, how neat.


00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.020
- Yeah. - How neat.


00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.680
Yeah, and then over here, let's see if I can find it,


00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.360
talked about the sources of data.


00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.000
There's all these different public sources of data


00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.280
that they put together.


00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.600
Then if you read through the article,


00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.880
you'll find that they were talking about,


00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.480
well, I think they spent a month and a half


00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.800
getting this far on the project.


00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.920
And they're like, well, I went through here


00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.600
and I had to correct all of these things


00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.680
'cause they were, this data was a little bit off here


00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.120
and that data was a little bit off there.


00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.000
And then I had to label them.


00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.200
And another thing that was talked about a lot


00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.280
is how do you create these pictures


00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.800
without text that overlaps?


00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.120
So we mentioned this thing's called


00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.760
- Pain of my life. - Adjust text.


00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.160
And where it'll actually take a matplotlib thing


00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.800
with labels and then rearrange the labels on the graph


00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.160
so that the text doesn't overlap, which is really cool.


00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.000
And it has a nice- - You've just changed my life.


00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
- Really?


00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.320
- Yes, this is like a huge problem.


00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.680
It's been solved, it exists, and it's just Python code.


00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.120
- Oh my God, I love when this stuff happens.


00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.960
- Isn't this cool?


00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.800
It's awesome, I'm glad.


00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.960
- I'm just like, jaw on the floor,


00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.080
like, oh, someone figure it out.


00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.840
(both laughing)


00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.120
- Super cool, that's awesome.


00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.600
So yeah, there's a bunch of stuff.


00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.680
And one of the things that I really took away from this


00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.160
was it reminds me of this quote


00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.720
that in the whole data science, scientific computing world,


00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.080
like, "Data cleaning isn't the grunt work,


00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.840
"it is the work," sort of thing.


00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.040
'Cause it's so much about,


00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.280
oh yeah, I could just run these together,


00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.040
but then I spent a month fixing this and correcting that


00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.940
and offsetting that, yeah.


00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.120
So, pretty neat.


00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.440
- That's really cool.


00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.280
- Yeah, I guess the final--


00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.240
- I wanna know where I am in galactic coordinates.


00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.840
(laughing)


00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.480
- I can't remember off the top of my head,


00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.920
but yeah, it does have galactic coordinates.


00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.400
I just don't know what they are.


00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.280
- So is the supermassive black hole


00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.120
at the center of the universe,


00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.600
is that at zero, zero, zero?


00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.120
- The center of our galaxy, yeah.


00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.520
So there's many galaxies in the universe,


00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.560
our galaxy's the Milky Way.


00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.520
The supermassive black hole at the center of it would be,


00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.980
- Yes, L equals zero, B equals zero.


00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.040
(laughing)


00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.560
- Okay, awesome.


00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.520
Awesome, yeah, I guess final thought is they say


00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.860
it takes about four hours to generate this map


00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.720
running using four cores running in parallel


00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.040
to actually render it 'cause it has so much data


00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.880
and whatnot, but anyway, pretty neat.


00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.700
If you're looking to build maps with Python,


00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.880
here's a bit of a case study, I suspect.


00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.600
- Is it open source?


00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.560
Like is it on GitHub?


00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.600
Can you grab it yourself and have a play around?


00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.040
- I wish, no.


00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.240
It's not, I looked around, I couldn't find much of the code.


00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.440
There's little snippets of code shown,


00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.740
but yeah, that's all.


00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.200
- I was thinking like, can I get a section of sky?


00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.240
I'm gonna print it out, I'm gonna frame it.


00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.280
It's gonna look really cool.


00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.600
- Exactly, yeah, this is the one I wanna put on the wall.


00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.440
Yes, I think you could do that.


00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.920
- Millennials love maps on walls.


00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.760
(laughs)


00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.960
That's what I'm gonna do. - Exactly, exactly.


00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.000
All right, before we move on this,


00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.960
just a quick shout out to Dr. Becky


00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.400
from ProdFund on the live stream.


00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.360
Yay, Dr. Becky is back.


00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.160
Bought your book after watching the live stream with Michael.


00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.040
Really enjoyed it,


00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.480
even though you don't have a space background.


00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.320
So very cool.


00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.140
- That's awesome.


00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.560
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.


00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.400
- Yeah.


00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.220
All right.


00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.840
Speaking of things that we couldn't all enjoy


00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.800
and can take us back, calculators.


00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.640
- Yes.


00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.460
- Tell us about it.


00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.800
- I was thinking about how I haven't thought


00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.720
about my graphical calculator in a long time.


00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.960
Like I swear I was attached at the hip to that thing


00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:22.280
throughout high school and then a little bit into university


00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.840
but not so much because they were like banned


00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.320
in our university exams because they thought


00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.640
that like it was, it was help us cheat, I guess.


00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640
I don't know.


00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.560
But it was so weird going from high school


00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.720
where they were like, "Use your graphical calculators."


00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.880
And then at university, they said, "No, don't use them."


00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.760
And I remember thinking, like, after that,


00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.960
I barely even thought about it.


00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.760
I don't even use it in my everyday, like,


00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.960
work or life anymore.


00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.640
When a lot of the things I do,


00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.440
I can just use Spotlight on my Mac


00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.520
to do a quick calculation or whatever,


00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.240
or I'll do it in Terminal or something like that.


00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.040
And then I saw this the other day,


00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.360
was just amazed by it


00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.460
because I remember this graphical calculator showing you,


00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.280
you could get up graphs of, you know,


00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.800
like e to the x or sine x or cos x


00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.560
or something on your calculator.


00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.960
But the screen like was, it was like an old Game Boy


00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.840
or like a Nokia 3310, right?


00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.400
It was the most pixelated screen in the world.


00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.360
And making those graphs was so frustrating.


00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.320
Like it just wasn't intuitive.


00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.160
It wasn't fun, I didn't think.


00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.520
And then I saw this the other day


00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.400
where look at what kids can use these days.


00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.520
They have this graphical calculator that has this


00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.680
proper, beautiful, actual color screen


00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.720
and that you can use Python on


00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.440
to make plots and do calculations.


00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.760
And I just think this is such a fantastic idea


00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.120
because teaching kids to code early is so important.


00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.880
Like it can be used in so many different areas


00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.100
of work and life and science and everything like that.


00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.800
But I always find learning to code


00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.400
without a purpose necessarily is really difficult.


00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.960
Like just deciding one day, I'm gonna learn how to code.


00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.200
Where do you start?


00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.280
Like, unless you've got a project, like what do you do?


00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.820
So the idea of learning as you're going through


00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.880
and actually learning the math or learning the science


00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.000
with your graphical calculator is so good


00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.920
because then it just starts to come naturally to you.


00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.680
It's like the first thing you think of to do


00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.040
to solve a problem is to use Python.


00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.360
So I'm just so excited that this is a thing


00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.580
And I hope it becomes like the calculator that kids have to buy, like if they're going


00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.640
to do maths at like a higher level or something.


00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.640
Yeah, it's so cool.


00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640
I'm so excited.


00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:40.280
Instead of those weird programming languages that come, you know, like Polish notation,


00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.200
reverse Polish notation and stuff, like this is preparing them for proper programming.


00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.200
Exactly.


00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.200
Yeah.


00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.680
And I think that if you learn it in this way, it will just become so second nature that


00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.760
then it's not a barrier for you to go on and do anything else.


00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.760
Right?


00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.020
becomes a tool that you can use to solve problems


00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.400
like in science or in sort of development


00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.760
or software development or something like that.


00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.080
As you get into university and wider world,


00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.920
like having that knowledge from that age is so good.


00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.640
I mean, I got mine at like 16.


00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.580
I don't know about if you guys remember


00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.540
when you got your graphical calculator,


00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.440
but I feel like at that age I was impressionable


00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.920
and it stuck with me.


00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.400
- Exactly.


00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.360
- Yeah, I think I might've gotten mine.


00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.760
It really was a decent one right when I got to college.


00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.320
But yeah, I even had one of the TI-93s


00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.560
that had a full QWERTY keyboard on it for a while.


00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.900
It was that big one, yeah, that was fancy


00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.500
when I was a TA in grad school.


00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.800
- Yeah, that's the thing.


00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.920
I think I got them early 'cause we specialize early


00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.600
in the UK, so I was only doing maths and science


00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.680
by 16 to 18, so that's why I got mine earlier.


00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.840
But yeah, learning Python then would have been so helpful


00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.440
'cause I got to university and they were like,


00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.000
"Oh, okay, now turn to learn Python."


00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.400
But let's do it while we learn general relativity.


00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.320
(laughing)


00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.040
And let's code up some general relativity.


00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.360
I was like, "Oh, yeah, I'm still printing hello world."


00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.400
Like, I was like, slow down.


00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.760
Yeah, so the fact that you can learn it there, here,


00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.680
it's so cool.


00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.920
- How do you type into this thing, though?


00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.040
- Like a calculator. - Very slowly.


00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.360
- Very slowly, first of all.


00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.200
Yeah, I imagine it probably just has


00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.080
like an old phone keyboard.


00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.480
So, you know, three letters per number,


00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.400
but it might have one of the full queries


00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.640
like Michael was talking about.


00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.280
- I think it's the more skinny tall ones,


00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.400
the more like an old phone.


00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.440
You know, it'd be awesome


00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.680
if you could transfer Python files over,


00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.960
but yeah, it has like a REPL and everything.


00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.800
Just pretty interesting.


00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.640
- That's pretty neat.


00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.880
- I hope they have auto-complete.


00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.720
(laughs)


00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.560
- Yes, oh.


00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.380
- That would be great.


00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.360
- Oh yeah, I hadn't even thought about that,


00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.520
but yes, it'd be better.


00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.080
The cool comments from the live stream,


00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.680
Marcel says, "Polish notations are opposite of method chain."


00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.080
And yeah, and Kim says, "Graphical calculators


00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.500
"would have been really handy in high school.


00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.020
"I never even seen one before.


00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.760
"Got into engineering, Python,


00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.180
"and reverse Polish notation."


00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.620
Sounds tricky.


00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.120
And then Pamphil Roy from the SciPy World,


00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.300
he says, "Oh yeah, and Elsa told me


00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.020
"you can't put things like SciPy on there, sadly."


00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.800
But hopefully soon, maybe this is just, you know, V1.


00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.180
Yeah, I guess packages in general, right?


00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.100
They talk about having turtle and stuff,


00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.180
but I'm not sure how much they have added modules.


00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.780
- How cool would it be to have SciPy on there?


00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.660
Because then you could like plot a function


00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.700
and then you could like optimize


00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.260
and you could like find the solutions


00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.300
to a function that way.


00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.260
Probably skipping the differential equations


00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.500
that you're supposed to be learning in math.


00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.340
- Exactly.


00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.140
I just partial differential equations are easy.


00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.420
I just say like solve and give it the number.


00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.260
- Yeah.


00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.080
I would check your answers in SciPy.


00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.100
- I think Turtles is kind of neat on there also


00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.100
because I mean, I programmed a sub hunt on my single line


00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.780
reverse polar notation, HP calculator,


00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.860
just because I could sort of thing.


00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.180
So I think doing some games in there,


00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.920
it might be kind of neat.


00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.420
- Yeah, yeah.


00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.920
We feel definitely agrees with you


00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.700
about how cool that would be.


00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.300
- Yeah. - Awesome.


00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.060
All right, before we move on to the next one,


00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.100
let me tell you about our sponsor this week.


00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.220
So this episode of Python Bytes


00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.860
is brought to you by Sentry.


00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.820
I love Sentry.


00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.260
We use Sentry.


00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.980
So how would you like to remove a little stress


00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.820
from your life?


00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.100
Do you worry that users might be having difficulties


00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.820
or encountering errors with your app right now?


00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.740
Would you even know if they did until they send that email?


00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.500
How much better would it be to have error


00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.460
or performance details immediately sent to you


00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.140
including call stacks, tracebacks,


00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.460
values of local variables,


00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.260
and even the logged in user that ran into the error?


00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.100
With Sentry, it's not just possible, but it's simple.


00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.460
We use Sentry, like I said, on all of our web apps,


00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.820
on Python Bytes and Talk Python, Talk Python Training courses.


00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.220
And I actually had somebody run into an error.


00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.820
I got a Sentry notification


00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.280
that this user had a problem doing this thing.


00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.380
I fixed it and sent them an email and they said,


00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.220
"Oh, that is incredible.


00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.160
I was about to email you about this problem I had,


00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.900
but it was late, so I was gonna do it tomorrow


00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.880
and you already fixed it.


00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.180
So what a surprise."


00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.460
So surprise and delight your users today.


00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.300
Create your Sentry account at pythonbytes.fm/sentry.


00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.420
And when you sign up, please,


00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.100
There's a button that says, get a promo code.


00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.780
Make sure that you enter Python bytes,


00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.140
all caps, all one word,


00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.640
and then you'll get the team plan,


00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.280
which gives you more features and more errors and so on.


00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.260
Not that you want more errors,


00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.420
but maybe more features is good.


00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:25.500
So, pythonbytes.fm/sentry and promo code Python bytes.


00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.660
Brian, you got the next one.


00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.620
- Okay.


00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.700
I gotta say though,


00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.220
that the artwork on that GetSentry page was great.


00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.460
- Yeah, it's very cool.


00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.580
Well done.


00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.380
So I've been trying to shift doing a little bit more work


00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.880
with GitHub Actions on my projects.


00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.240
But, you know, there's probably great documentation somewhere.


00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.820
I just don't know where it is.


00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.340
And I'm impatient, so I kind of want somebody to just say,


00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.780
"For Python, this is what you do."


00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.080
So there's a few of these walkthroughs,


00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.780
but I like this one that I just saw recently.


00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:05.820
This one's Python package CI/CD with GitHub Actions.


00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.680
just write what it says on the tin.


00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.700
But this is a nice walkthrough of some of the different things,


00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.940
and they're going through an example project,


00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.020
of course, but it's nice.


00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:26.180
First off, talks about when you want actions to happen.


00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.580
In talking about when they happen,


00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:34.900
this project happens on pull request and on push to certain branches.


00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.400
in this case, main branch.


00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.200
But you really can pick several branches that you can do this on


00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.100
and to have actions happen on those.


00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.900
I kind of like having a couple of different development branches,


00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.000
especially on things that I'm active on and don't want to release yet.


00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.800
So these are nice.


00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.400
And then what else?


00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.600
I'm going through a matrix of stuff.


00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.400
So most of the article is talking about syntax checking on different things.


00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.900
I don't know if really that's important,


00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:09.460
but I would probably do a Pytest on multiple matrices.


00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.540
But the notion of a matrix is interesting,


00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.660
the having the different environments.


00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.100
In this case, this person is talking about maybe running on


00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:25.260
multiple versions of Python across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.


00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.220
That's exactly what I want,


00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.780
those sorts of combinations to make sure something's working.


00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:35.220
With all the devices and stuff that you have, do you see this maybe even some at work as well,


00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.420
like with all the hardware devices and the different ways it's configured?


00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.520
Well, couldn't use GitHub Actions, but we definitely use matrices


00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.980
to figure out which tests have to run on different configurations and different hardware.


00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.880
And it's just exploding. But yeah, that's a different nightmare.


00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.080
But this one is taken care of for you.


00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.400
So it's a neat thing to test across all those.


00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.600
I knew how to do it on TOCs,


00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.040
I knew how to do it on Travis,


00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.960
and getting it to work and get


00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.400
have actions is just different.


00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.040
It's not harder, it's just different.


00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.480
So I appreciate this walkthrough.


00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.120
Then what?


00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.960
Example of running tests, of course,


00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.560
and checking artifacts, which is interesting.


00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.480
I hadn't thought about that.


00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.100
your build might generate documents


00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.580
or other artifacts that you want to keep around.


00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.980
Having some checks around those is a good idea too.


00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.900
Then the last couple of bits,


00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.860
and really why I'm highlighting this is


00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.580
because I didn't really know how to do this,


00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.140
is doing auto-merges on some branches.


00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.560
There's some branches that maybe you're


00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.340
maintaining and nobody else has access to.


00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.140
But if you push to that,


00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.420
you want test to run and then


00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.960
automatically to merge to something.


00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.860
Setting up auto-merge, there's some steps around that,


00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.760
which is pretty darn cool.


00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.160
The last bit is pushing to PyPI.


00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.740
>> Nice.


00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.680
>> Release automation so you can automatically,


00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.640
in this case, setting up a rule so that if you


00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.540
push a tag that starts with a V,


00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.240
that means you've updated the version and you


00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.160
want that to push automatically out to PyPI.


00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.200
So hooking that up with GitHub Actions.


00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.040
- Oh, that's clever.


00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.560
I'd never thought about triggering it off of a tag name.


00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.360
I've always thought of it just certain branch means go,


00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.100
but yeah, that's clever.


00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.760
- Yeah, so that way you can even have like a main branch


00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.040
that has updated workflow, updated things,


00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.040
but it doesn't get pushed until there's a new version,


00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:40.960
which makes sense.


00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.840
- Yeah.


00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.460
Dr. Becky, what's the story with GitHub Actions


00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.880
and all of your colleagues, people use it?


00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.520
- I don't think I even know what GitHub Actions is


00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.640
to be quite, I had a drink and I spared you from hearing me gulp before. Yeah.


00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.040
I don't even think I know what I've used GitHub actions to be quite honest.


00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.880
Um, I'm sure some of my colleagues, I use GitHub all the time, obviously,


00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.080
but GitHub actions, I'm trying to remember. I don't think so.


00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.320
I'm sure somebody has though, but no.


00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.840
Yeah. I'm sure some people maintain some of the packages and stuff.


00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.560
That's what I was thinking. Yeah. I don't think I have anything like that.


00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.960
to maintain a lot of my colleagues put out stuff,


00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.640
but really my code is for my use and for


00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.680
any specific colleague that has a science case use for it.


00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:30.080
But GitHub, I love GitHub because one of the things I love doing with it is committing.


00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.280
When I've written a scientific paper,


00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.480
I'll even put the latex on GitHub,


00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.640
what we code our scientific writing in.


00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:43.520
The PDF is included in your commits and then you can make


00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.680
a GIF from your commit history of your PDF,


00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.240
building up, adding parts and all the words adding.


00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.360
It's one of my favorite things to do once I've finished because it feels like,


00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:58.440
it's like, "Oh, I've done this project and now I can see it fully take form."


00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.320
I remember I wrote my thesis,


00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:05.480
my entire PhD thesis in about two months because I got a job and I had to finish


00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.560
my PhD and I had to write it up.


00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.520
I don't remember much from that whole two-month time.


00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:16.600
It's a huge blur, except one vivid memory of the fire alarm going off in the department.


00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:21.600
I'm being like, "Panic! Git commit, Git push!"


00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.600
I was just...


00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.600
Remember this, I've got this one commit message in my thesis repo


00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.600
that's basically just, I just mullet the keyboard


00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.600
because I was just like, "The firewall's going off!"


00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.600
Git commit anything and Git push because I was like,


00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.600
"What if I don't have a backup of the past eight hours of writing I've just done?"


00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.600
It was a huge bulk and I was just like, "I'm not losing this!"


00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.600
And people were pulling me out of the room because the firewall was going off.


00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.600
You've got to run away.


00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.600
Oh my gosh, that's so funny.


00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600
But, ugh.


00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.600
Yeah.


00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.600
That reminds me of a sign I saw once.


00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600
Yes.


00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.600
[laughter]


00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.600
Exactly.


00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.600
A case of fire.


00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.600
One, get commit.


00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.600
Two, get push.


00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.600
Three, leave building.


00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.600
I actually went through this, but during a PhD thesis write-up,


00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.600
which I would never recommend to anybody.


00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.600
[laughter]


00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.600
I'm amazed that you found this image so fast.


00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.440
(laughing)


00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.680
- Oh yeah, no problem.


00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.200
I'm on, I got you.


00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.040
Couple of comments from the live stream.


00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.080
Justin Boyce says, "Love being able to use


00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.400
"GitHub Actions for deployment.


00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.240
"Keeps me from botching deployment by making mistakes."


00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.080
I agree.


00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.080
Do it more often if it's automatic.


00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.560
And then Jared Chung says, "Looks great.


00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.140
"Definitely gonna hook this up to the packages I maintain,


00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.280
"but which change infrequently


00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.160
"so you don't have to remember the workflow," and so on.


00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.200
And finally, Marcel Milsent says,


00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:48.320
Her GitHub is now offering free tier for institutions with unlimited contributors for private repos and $2,000,


00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.000
or 2,000 actions a month for $0. So, yeah.


00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.600
That goes alongside with the academics package as well, right?


00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:01.680
For students, it's not just students, it's also anybody with like a .edu email or .ac.uk,


00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.960
which is the universities over here.


00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.560
So I have like a loads of free repos and stuff like that, which is great.


00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.280
I'm so good at them.


00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.240
Yeah, fantastic.


00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.080
- Well, cool.


00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.680
All right, moving on to number five.


00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.280
Not this one, this one.


00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.840
- Another spacey one.


00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.080
- Another spacey one.


00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.600
Garrett Dunn gave us a shout out saying,


00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.600
"SpaceX is now using Python for prototyping


00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.060
their Starlink satellite software."


00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:31.060
Which I don't know how you feel about Starlink, Dr. Becky.


00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.240
I mean, as an astronomer, it's like in your way,


00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.840
but as a way to empower people in remote places,


00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.840
it's kind of cool.


00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.720
I'm really split about it to be honest, because I want it to go ahead.


00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.440
I think it's a really cool project, but I think there's more compromises need to be


00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:49.960
made in order for it to work in the way that it could, like the most efficiently the way


00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.960
that it could.


00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.840
And I know like even before this launched, I'd take an image and I'll end up with a satellite


00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.280
trail and at least one of 10 I've taken at a telescope that evening.


00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.600
And there's going to be more, right?


00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.600
Exactly.


00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.600
Yeah.


00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.600
And it's not like something you can remove.


00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.600
People are like, "Oh, just remove it as a source of noise."


00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:12.720
thing goes like right over your, you know, 15 minute exposure of a galaxy that's millions


00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.720
of light years away. And this massive bright thing just goes right over the middle. It


00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.080
ruins it, right? There's no rescuing that. So I do want it to go ahead. I do want it


00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.840
to work. But it's really cool that they're going to use Python. Like that could be something


00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.000
we could get warnings from, you know, like if it's something as accessible as Python,


00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.960
so to say, something's going over, pause observation, carry on or something like that, you know?


00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:39.960
Yeah, I would actually love to see SpaceX work more closely with all the satellite locations


00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.960
and observatories and say, "All right, here's how we're going to help you solve this problem."


00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.960
Yeah, that would be great.


00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:52.960
Yeah, diving into this. So Stack Overflow actually did a four-part series on the software


00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.960
that SpaceX used to build all of their things in space. And this one in particular is about


00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.860
about the network protocols.


00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:04.560
So if you look at how the Starlink system works,


00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.400
it turns out that most of the stuff is C++


00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.120
both on the ground systems and the things in the sky.


00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.920
So they talk about that their software breaks


00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.800
into two parts, software that flies


00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.560
and software that supports the things that fly.


00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.120
So the software that flies is all C++


00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.120
that's on embedded chips on the satellites.


00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.320
But then on the ground,


00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.920
there's a whole bunch of communication APIs


00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.720
and coordination APIs.


00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.680
If you look over at where these satellites are


00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.720
and where they're covering,


00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.440
there's these cool real-time maps.


00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.200
And I'll put one on the screen here.


00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.120
You could actually see them flying by here


00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.960
where Brian and I are.


00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.680
Please zoom in on that area.


00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.400
And you can see the overlap of the signals


00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.440
of the different ones and how they're oriented


00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.120
and all kinds of stuff.


00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.040
So they need to adjust and move these satellites around


00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.840
in orchestration and orchestrate them basically.


00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.100
So the software that does that,


00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.040
it's in production version in C++,


00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.100
but they do a lot of simulations and


00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.600
prototyping in Python to figure out how that works.


00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.420
Because think about the in-body problem,


00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.720
but for thousands or hundreds of thousands of these things,


00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.100
to keep them all working together,


00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.440
the combinatorics of it get out of control really quick, they say.


00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.480
So there's a lot of simulations that need to be done,


00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.560
and they do that in Python.


00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.480
Once they get the working version,


00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.880
then they rewrite that in C++.


00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.780
What do you two think?


00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.080
This is a cool picture, right?


00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.080
Mm. Yeah, that's really cool.


00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:29.680
It is neat.


00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.680
Yeah. And speaking of GitHub Actions,


00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.480
they probably are actually using GitHub for this,


00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.980
but it doesn't explicitly say.


00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.380
But you think of organizations


00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.980
that have a hard time deploying their code,


00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.980
like you'll go to a website,


00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.980
like our website is down all of Sunday


00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.480
because we're deploying a new version.


00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.280
Like, are you kidding me?


00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.680
This is 2021.


00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.680
Like this should be Git push,


00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.780
wait a few seconds,


00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:49.880
and it's now the new version.


00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.080
Anyway, this is pretty interesting


00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.880
because they say the software is developed


00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.080
in a continuous integration environment


00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.520
with teams merging into the master development branch often


00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.200
and deploying to all of the satellites weekly.


00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.040
- Huh.


00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.280
(both laughing)


00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.480
- That adds an extra level of panic to you,


00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.320
Git push, doesn't it?


00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.400
- It definitely does.


00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400
Oh, whoops, I wasn't ready.


00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.320
All the satellites stopped responding.


00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.160
Whoops.


00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.560
So yeah, it says the Python version allows them


00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.520
to wrap for rapid iteration during the design phase.


00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.360
And once it's all happy, they write in C++.


00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.680
So yeah, anyway, pretty cool.


00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.260
I'll link to some of these maps that track it


00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.780
and the four-part series and so on.


00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.640
So Garrett, thank you for that.


00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.200
- It's really cool to see 'cause it's very similar


00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.460
to what Space Telescope are doing


00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.440
for the James Webb Space Telescope.


00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.480
Sorry, Space Telescope is the institution in Baltimore


00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.480
that manages the Hubble Space Telescope


00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.480
and the new one that's gonna hopefully launch in October


00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.640
is called the James Webb Space Telescope.


00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.260
And I think that's a similar sort of platform


00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.620
and a lot of the spacecraft sort of mechanics


00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.460
is done with sort of the usual comms that they have,


00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.060
possibly C++, but a lot of the tools they put together


00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.340
for astronomers who are planning observations,


00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.900
like where to point, how long that will take,


00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.020
and all those kind of things when they're sort of deciding,


00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.460
I wanna use this to do this science,


00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.820
that's all been done in Python.


00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:11.540
Like all of the sort of tutorials of like how to figure out


00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.860
how much like James Webb Space Telescope


00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.700
will be able to see of this thing you wanna look at


00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.820
is all done in like IPython notebooks.


00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.220
Jupiter, I guess we should call them now.


00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.220
>> Yeah.


00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.500
>> So it's really cool to see that it's not just


00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.620
like these major academic institutions that are picking up Python,


00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.260
because they know it's the academics that use that,


00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.420
but it's companies like SpaceX as well,


00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.300
I guess because they know their employees work well with Python.


00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.500
>> That's really cool. I knew a lot of the telescopes were using Python,


00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.700
but that's going to be a massive new telescope,


00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.260
the James Webb telescope, it's going to be a big deal, right?


00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.860
>> Yeah, it's going to be a huge deal.


00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:52.380
We've all got fingers crossed that launch actually happens because it was originally planned for 10 years ago and three years ago.


00:35:52.380 --> 00:36:00.060
Yeah, fingers crossed I guess for coming soon. All right, Dr. Becky, you got the next one.


00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:08.380
Yeah, so I feel like I've done the scientist thing of bringing a scientific paper to a Python podcast, but I'm bringing what I know.


00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:13.100
So I found this paper a while back when I was sort of, you know, doing the


00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.460
the thing of like you're an expert in something because you know what to Google.


00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:22.300
But I was looking for something and I found this paper, the Beginner's Guide to Working


00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:28.460
with Astronomical Data. And it's very much written as if you're a poor PhD student that's come in and


00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:33.020
your professor has said, "Hey, here's a lot of data, please analyze it." And you're like,


00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:37.740
"I don't know where to start." So that's kind of who it's written for. And I think if you are


00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:43.740
a really keen amateur astronomer, and I know a lot of people do want to get into astrophotography,


00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:48.980
and possibly did during the pandemic with lockdowns and stay at home orders, and perhaps


00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:54.740
might have set up something with like a Raspberry Pi, you know, to control a telescope, to know


00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:59.860
where it's pointing, something like that, or even to adapt it with a camera as well.


00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:06.820
And then they have all these images that they then want to remove noise and get like a beautiful


00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.500
color image of something as well.


00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.180
And they're not entirely sure how to do it, but they might know Python.


00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:17.020
I use Python to analyze the images that come off the back of professional telescopes.


00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.420
So you could do it with amateur telescopes or amateur camera, just an SLR camera you've


00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:25.380
set up in your back garden to take an image of something.


00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.180
But you want to see fainter and fainter things.


00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.020
You have to take lots and lots of short images so you don't get motion blur and stuff like


00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.020
that with actually the rotation of the earth.


00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.300
But they're all the wrong coordinates.


00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.300
So what do you do?


00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.300
Because they're not all in the same place.


00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.380
So you use Astropy to figure out how to do this.


00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.580
Does it like realign the images to adjust for that rotation?


00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.780
Exactly. Yeah, yeah. And so, but there's obviously lots of other steps that you need to do, like


00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:54.980
taking out noise. So this actually talks through like all of the steps that would go into what a


00:37:54.980 --> 00:38:00.900
professional would do. And I reading it, I think it's so well written that I think someone who is


00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:07.620
a really keen amateur and who wants to get into astrophotography and do the, you know,


00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:12.260
reduction, as we call it, of the images, you know, make them look extra pretty by the end of it,


00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:16.980
with Python, because they're a keen Python person, I think this would be the thing to be like,


00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:22.420
right, I'm going to make this my bedtime reading. It's very, very long. But I think you could


00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:27.700
definitely make this like a project if someone was keen enough to do and so that's why I thought I'd


00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:33.540
I'd bring it and I feel like obviously, we need a huge shout out to Astropy and Matplotlib and


00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.580
and everything like that for making these kinds of things possible with images that


00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.980
you can take in your back garden and stuff that you can get at.


00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:46.200
But someone in a month or so, if they're really keen on Python and they're really keen on


00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:50.820
taking photos of the night sky, you could be getting images of galaxies and nebula that


00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:51.820
look amazing.


00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.820
So that's why I thought of bringing it.


00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:53.820
That'd be amazing.


00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:54.820
Print them out.


00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:58.020
Yeah, print it out and put it up as artwork in your house or something.


00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.020
That'd be fantastic.


00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.300
Instead of just saying, "That's a cool picture of a galaxy."


00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.500
I took that picture of that galaxy. That's totally different.


00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.380
Exactly. Yeah, you know, I can imagine someone getting an amazing picture of Andromeda, you know,


00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:14.420
and following these steps that it outlies. And I think it's easier because, especially if you know Python,


00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:20.900
there's no learning curve with a new tool or a new or like frustration with a GUI, right?


00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:25.140
That's just this like, interface, what's going on, I don't have to use it. Because it's just pure Python.


00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.420
I think if you already know Python, it's definitely the easiest way to get into this,


00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.620
because it'll be something familiar with something new.


00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.460
So even though it's a scientific paper,


00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.300
(laughing)


00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.380
I think it would pass, so.


00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.620
- Yeah, it looks super interesting.


00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.660
The code doesn't look terribly challenging,


00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.740
but it's exactly what you need to solve the problems, right?


00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:46.860
- Exactly, yeah.


00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.780
- Cool, cool.


00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.260
All right, I think that's it for our six items.


00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.980
Brian, you got anything?


00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.140
- No, I just apologize to the stream people.


00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.700
For some reason, my video stream is frozen.


00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.980
- I think that we might just be really, really zen


00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.180
and still.


00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.220
- I thought he was just really interested in the paper,


00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.820
but he was like, "Wow, look at that."


00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.340
- You've mesmerized him, absolutely.


00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.260
All right, so before we move on, actually,


00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.100
Justin Boyd says, "Thanks for bringing this, Dr. Becky.


00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.140
"I did pick up astrophotography barely as a hobby


00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.740
"during the pandemic and it looks good."


00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.580
So yeah, already, I already got one person into it.


00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.620
- Taking that like biggest step to go from like,


00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.180
"Oh, cool, I managed to photograph some stars,"


00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.900
to getting like the galaxy's nebula.


00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.820
I think this will help people take that step, I think so.


00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.320
- Yeah, for sure.


00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.720
- I'm glad it helped.


00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.960
- I got a couple of quick shout outs at the end.


00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.300
First, I wanna point out that


00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.740
if you like this conversation,


00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.820
check out episode 303 of Talk Python,


00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.460
where Dr. Becky and I dive all into


00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.120
the Python astronomy world, that was fun.


00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.520
And then I just met with one of the founders


00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.200
of this company called Kabuntu Focus,


00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.320
which I thought was a pretty interesting idea.


00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:00.220
So what they're going for is, you know,


00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.200
the way that Apple works is right,


00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.040
you know, they make the Mac and then they make macOS


00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.340
and that tight integration of those two things


00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.640
works better than just, you know,


00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.920
bringing pieces together


00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.080
and building your own sort of thing, right?


00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.260
So that's sort of the same idea, but for Linux.


00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.520
And so it's really focused on people who do AI type of work


00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.540
or just want to have a really good desktop Linux environment.


00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.640
So for example, down here at the bottom,


00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.480
keeping it in the space world.


00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.680
We have Chris Mattman, who, if I refresh it,


00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.040
it'll come up at the right time, maybe.


00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.560
It's supposed to cycle, anyway,


00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.760
Chris Mattman said he, who works at JPL,


00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.280
who he did some machine learning training


00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.700
on his MacBook Pro, and it took like 37 hours.


00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.480
And on this thing, because they have these crazy GPUs,


00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.880
these like GeForce 3080s and stuff in the laptop,


00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.200
they did it in like an hour and a half


00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.720
instead of 37 hours or whatever it was.


00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.040
So, and by the way, you can actually buy it.


00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.940
Like these new GeForce chips are cards.


00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.160
They're basically unobtainium, right?


00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.880
You can't get to them.


00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.160
So yeah, anyway, pretty, pretty interesting.


00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.840
If you're looking for a desktop Linux world, check that out.


00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.080
Dr. Becky, anything you would like to give a shout out to?


00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.040
Maybe I could throw out your Amazon page.


00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:14.880
- Yeah, sure.


00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.120
- Anything else you can tell us, yeah?


00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.120
- Yeah, so I've written a book.


00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.280
So it's got different names everywhere in the world


00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.340
just to confuse everybody.


00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.260
So in the US and Canada, it's called


00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.460
"Space at the Speed of Light."


00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.780
In the UK and pretty much everywhere else in the world,


00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.260
it's "Space 10 Things You Should Know."


00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.700
And then there's also the German edition as well,


00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:33.540
which I'm not trying to butcher.


00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.140
(speaking in foreign language)


00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:37.980
Yeah, exactly.


00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.660
It's a good book title.


00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.860
It's essentially, it's written for,


00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.620
I think anyone who is a complete beginner in space,


00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.820
but has always maybe been a little bit curious


00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:48.820
would love this book.


00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.920
It's like the 10 things that if you were gonna be


00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.980
at a dinner party and you'd be like,


00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.420
"Hey, did you know this?"


00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.580
These are the things you should know about space, right?


00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.420
But I also think that anybody who's--


00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.620
- Dr. Becky told me about it.


00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.840
- Yeah. (laughs)


00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.100
I also think anybody who's been keen on space as well


00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.020
will also get a kick out of it


00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.560
because it takes ideas that you might have heard before,


00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.300
but then just adds a little extra level


00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.660
of where we are right now on the edge


00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.520
of our understanding of this thing.


00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.860
So it's a really short read as well.


00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.580
It's not heavy, it's not a big hefty thing.


00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:20.980
It's really skinny.


00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.820
My laptop's currently propped on top of it,


00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.900
otherwise I would show you how skinny it is,


00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.640
but I disrupt everything.


00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.940
So yeah, if people want to check that out, please do.


00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.700
Or if you have like, I don't know, an uncle or an aunt


00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.300
or a nephew or a niece or whatever that you think


00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.500
would like that.


00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.340
- Yeah, fantastic.


00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.020
- I've been told it's a good gift, so.


00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:41.860
- Yeah.


00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.140
Rehan asked, is it really big?


00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.780
Nope, it's not that big.


00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.460
- It's about 200 pages or so.


00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.220
Yeah, Proud Van says, "I can vouch for the book."


00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.060
Yeah, absolutely.


00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:50.900
- Thank you, Proud Van.


00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:55.140
- And then also says that Bryant imported Zen.


00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:55.980
It's just very cute.


00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:56.800
(laughing)


00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.640
- I like that.


00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.600
- Well, I've got a close friend that has a telescope


00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.740
and he always wants to talk about space and I know nothing.


00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.380
So I'm definitely gonna read this book


00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.540
so I can talk to him.


00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.860
- There you go. - Oh, fantastic.


00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.460
- Perfect for that.


00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.940
- All right, I have, we always close out the show


00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:17.420
with a joke, but I've went and found some space memes


00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.420
'cause Dr. Becky is here, and you've done a couple of videos


00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.780
on reacting to space memes, and so I thought maybe


00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.540
some space memes would be appropriate


00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.420
as our jokes for the week. - Yeah, they're so fun,


00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.740
because people click on them and they're like,


00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.340
"I just learned more in this 15-minute video


00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.120
"about space memes than I did in my entire


00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.940
"high school career in physics."


00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.940
And I'm like, "That was always my intention, wah-ha-ha."


00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:39.900
(both laughing)


00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.300
I draw you in with the memes,


00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.180
and then I hit you with the science.


00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.140
- Exactly, exactly, it's so good.


00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:49.580
Yeah, so maybe we can link to some of the proper ones you've done.


00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:49.900
There's a lot.


00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.500
So I'm going to throw out four quick little space names at the four is it.


00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.520
I got to remember what the names I gave them each a title.


00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.680
So the first one is Uber.


00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.100
So there's Matt Damon sitting on ours alone.


00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:04.220
Remember he gets abandoned there and he says, where's my Uber?


00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.080
And then there's the Elon Musk.


00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.000
Rose tree shot in the spaces.


00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.840
I'll be there in a minute.


00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:15.080
I mean, I don't know whose definition of minute that is.


00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:21.560
Seriously, why did they launch a Tesla into space?


00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.480
Every time I'm reminded that they did this, I'm like, but why?


00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.480
Why?


00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.480
There's no reason.


00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.480
Because they could.


00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:35.600
I think that was just because they could, they never stopped to think whether they should.


00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.880
Yeah, well, it's the same company that is rocking Dogecoin.


00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.880
So you know.


00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.880
Yeah.


00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.880
All right, next one.


00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.160
This one is called "Flaws, Spaceship Design".


00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.840
Here's a picture of a spaceship with a cutout


00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.680
so you can see inside.


00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.040
It says, "When building a spaceship,


00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.800
the tiniest details are crucial.


00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.640
For example, this spaceship may be flawed


00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.600
because it has a giant hole in the side."


00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.260
(both laughing)


00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:04.480
- I love Brian's like squeak laughing.


00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.480
That's the level he's reaching.


00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.960
- That's awesome.


00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.600
And yet he's still very still in the frame.


00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:18.520
I do love these, they're like a hybrid between a really scientific diagram and then something


00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.280
you would put out to the public or use in a talk or something like that.


00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:29.400
I remember the ELT, the Extremely Large Telescope that we're building, which I know is a stupid


00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:37.120
name, they used emperor penguins for scale next to it in the public image.


00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.880
I was like, who knows how big an emperor penguin is?


00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.320
Is that like a knee height?


00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.160
Is that a waist?


00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.000
What are we talking here?


00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.200
Apparently it's because on average


00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.880
an emperor penguin is a meter high.


00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.320
So they were like, oh perfect, it's a meter.


00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.520
It's like a meter rule.


00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.280
I was like, yeah, but nobody knows that.


00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.440
Like just put a human.


00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:59.320
Dean links them out there in the live stream says,


00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.240
boy, the mileage on that Tesla


00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.560
would make it really hard to resell.


00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.400
I agree.


00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.600
I like that.


00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.680
All right, the next one is distracted.


00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.960
There's a cat in a space suit staring.


00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.100
It says mesmerized by the red dot on the wall.


00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.380
Missed space launch.


00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:18.380
I'm now wondering if there's been any like cat-stronauts


00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.980
in previous, there's been dog-stronauts


00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.180
and there's been monkey-stronauts,


00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:26.860
but I don't know if we've ever sent a cat to space.


00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.980
I propose a new thing,


00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.700
like maybe a cat could spend some time


00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.740
on the International Space Station.


00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.320
Just think of all the memes and all the funny videos.


00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.020
I don't think it would have a good time.


00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.540
Can you imagine like, it constantly tries to have its like,


00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:45.500
hackles raised, but it can't 'cause it's in zero G.


00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.960
It just goes in a small circle really slowly.


00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.420
Yeah, maybe, you know how they,


00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.020
there's those videos online where they put like,


00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.460
sellotape on the back of a cat and it constantly like,


00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.980
crouches to go under something that's not there?


00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.580
Maybe it would do something like that.


00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.060
Like, I don't know, I'm really intrigued now,


00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.820
a cat in zero G, what would it do?


00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.460
- Bayfield says, "Congo tried to send a rat."


00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.340
- Once they've sent a rat, they're gonna need a cat


00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.960
to solve the rat in space problem.


00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.300
- And they said, also, Justin says, "Space toys are hard.


00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.940
"Space litter boxes are nearly impossible."


00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.460
And Sam Worley is like, "You really think they could get


00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.260
"a cat to go into a space rocket?"


00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.340
(laughing)


00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.020
- The minute they open the door of the space rocket,


00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.260
the cat will just dart onto the vent,


00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.260
but you can't get it.


00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.460
(laughing)


00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.100
Like when you take it to the vet.


00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.900
- All right, let's round it out the last one,


00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.500
Space Vegas.


00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.860
It's a black hole.


00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.780
What happens in a black hole stays in a black hole.


00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.980
- Nice, Space Vegas, I like it.


00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.020
- That's right, yeah.


00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.420
I know we talked about this one before,


00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.300
but it made it in a second time.


00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.820
- I guess instead of Sin City,


00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.060
would it be like Bin City?


00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:55.900
'Cause I don't know.


00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.260
- Yeah, Spin City, yeah.


00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.900
- Spin City, yeah, maybe, something like that.


00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.660
- Things rotate as they go into the black hole, right?


00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:04.300
They don't just go straight, do they?


00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.840
- Yeah, yeah, it's actually really, really hard


00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:09.440
grow a black hole and make stuff fall in, which everyone's always really surprised at


00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.920
because they think they're like hoopers, but most stuff just orbits them. Like the earth orbits the


00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:18.560
sun. It's just a kind of a heavier sun that we can't see. Right. So most stuff orbits,


00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.480
it doesn't fall in and it takes a lot of effort to make stuff fall in. So.


00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.040
Nice. Well, once it's in, it stays there.


00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.640
Yeah. I'm getting it out.


00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:32.400
Fantastic. All right. Well, Dr. Becky, thanks for being here. It was really great to have you. And


00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.000
Brian. Thanks as always. Good to be with you. Yeah, you bet. Bye everyone.
