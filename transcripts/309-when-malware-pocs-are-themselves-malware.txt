00:00:00 Hello, and welcome to python bytes where we delivered news and headlines directly to your earbuds. This is episode 309. Recorded November 8, election day, I am Brian Aachen,

00:00:10 and I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:11 Okay, now let's look at this thing.

00:00:13 So first of all, we designed the Python bytes website to make it like responsive. So even like the table gets, like super cool when you scroll up, but that's not what I want to talk about. That's not why I brought it up. I mean, I always get these emails. I know you haven't logged into our site in five years, but we've redesigned it. Let's tell you about like, No, I don't care. The reason I'm on this page, what is the date today? November? What is the eighth? The eighth yesterday? Was Python bytes birthday, six years old now?

00:00:40 Gosh, I can't believe it's been six years.

00:00:43 So yeah, six years. The intro to the show. And PIP nine is out. What are we on? Like Pip? 30 stuff added? I've been paid attention. Well, it went from it's past 20 For sure.

00:00:53 They went from semver to calver. So you can't it's hard to count.

00:00:57 still been a long time? Yeah, absolutely. All right. Well, anyway, happy birthday to us. Let's let's do a cake. I know cake. We have to use cake emoji somewhere today, I suppose. All right. So I want to tell you about something that really touches on the cybersecurity pen testing, you know, Red Team, Blue Team, sort of hacker side. And I don't know if people are aware that Python is used a lot for the pen testing, security side of the world. We've had some guests on the show here before that talked about their work, right? We're like, Oh, we don't understand this. You got to come share this with people yourself. It's awesome. But we were not worthy. But there's a really interesting set of research. And this research came from Sofia on Yasmani. And Robin Fay and Olga Gadia Taska. Sorry, if I butchered everyone's name there. But it's as the title of the official academic articles is out of Norway, I think how security professionals are being attacked a study of malicious CVE proof of concept exploits and get up Have you have you run across this?

00:02:05 No. Interesting.

00:02:06 So it's, it sounds like it doesn't totally apply as maybe a Python programmer thing. But here's the deal. In order to win these CVE IDs, these vulnerabilities come out and get announced a lot of times people are like, Oh my gosh, there's some problem. But like, what does it manifest? Like if I'm going to write some code to explore it, understand it to do all the various things? How do I get started? Right? A lot of these are super complicated. And so what people will do is they'll post a simple proof of concept. Like imagine you've got a sandboxed web browser, and it shouldn't be able to access like, for example, your processes and other parts of your file system. So if I went to a webpage, I could make it pop up. I don't know, notepad with the text, not another No, no, we got you know, something silly like that, like, Oh, my God, it open Notepad? Well, these people did some research, and they found 47,000 hosted proofs of concept. And let's see somewhere, it's in the article, they talk about the actual language breakdown. Here you go. So when they said, What languages are these written in? HTML? 300, Ruby? 300, go 400, C++ 1000, Python 8000. So that's a lot, right? So Python is by a factor of eight, the most common language that they are able to determine the language of the exploit. So it's, it's something that really kind of applies to us and of the, how many were there, there was, like 47,000 of them. And out of those 4800 or 10%, or malicious, which sounds like so what, it's a proof of concept of a malicious thing. No, it's like a meta malicious. So here's the deal, it says, we will show you how you can break into Active Directory on this new exploit what it really does is installs ransomware on your computer. So if you as a if you as a personnel, like I want to try this out and see if our system is vulnerable, like instead of it doing what it said it would do, it just takes over your computer. And there's various ways in which it does it might contact like laugh, unknown, malicious. Now, I know there are some walls in there to be sure but but the idea is there some it'll like take your you know, your SSH keys and like, upload them to some malicious, you know, paste bin type place, or it will install crypto miners or it'll install a you know, a ransomware and krypton types of things. And a few of them say, you shouldn't have just run code off the internet. What are you doing? And it'll like Rick Rule you, but the majority of them take take over for real so there's isn't that nuts? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So Rick rules

00:04:42 earlier and just say they are in the

00:04:45 they are even in the paper. There's actually some, some Python proof of code. So he'll me show you down here, like, pull this up. I don't know how to link to a code listing inside of a PDF So I'm just gonna prove that here we go. So for example, over here, so here it says, this is an example of one of these proof of concepts that shows you how things might work. And what is it going to do? It's going to go and say it's going to sleep for a second, get your host name, create a user thing done it. And then, oddly, instead of saying the URL is a thing, the URL is a base 64, decoded, encoded bunch of garbage, right? What is this? This, this is the malicious website that they're going to send your information to. But when you look at it, it doesn't look like here's the virus. It's like, oh, you're just decoding this text? I see. No, no, no, this is the virus right there. And there's way more complicated examples. But pretty much anyway, what's the format

00:05:42 of your servers? They should really run black on this?

00:05:44 I know, they totally, they totally should, you deserve what you get, if you're on that. Now, this is a pretty interesting thing. And if you're in the security space, you know, if there's a 10% chance of just checking out one of these proof of concepts that you'll get owned, you know, just be aware, I mean, you consider the the audience of the people creating these. So I guess, you know, a bunch of hackers are like, Hey, I made this code, just try it.

00:06:05 No, actually, we should have like a search thing or something like that. Because that base 64 decode thing is a classic, just don't touch it sort of thing. If, especially if it's going into a URL or something this is it's not good. Yeah,

00:06:19 they did come up with a way to automatically test for things. They said, Look, if it's couldn't contacting a well known, malicious can command and control type, IP address, which there's a listing a database of these types of things. Like, you know what, that's a problem. And here's a proof of concept that should have nothing to do with the Internet. And it's uploading data that doesn't seem like it should, right, or it's downloading this data from somewhere else. Yeah, yeah. I like that. Kim has got the he's got the glass half full, a basic C four encoded URL is surely completely safe, and nothing to worry about. And Marco is concerned about the SSH keys. And thanks for the Happy Birthday Wishes out in the audience as well. From everyone. Yeah, yeah. Thanks, people. All right, Brian. That's all I got. But there's a really cool paper. There's proof of concepts in there. There's a couple of write ups on it. It's worth checking out.

00:07:06 Okay, cool. Well, I actually want to talk about something completely sort of different. So if you've, let's just go to us for a second. If normally, I get a lot of my news from people on Twitter, but Twitter kind of is in the news lately, because things are kind of going weird with Twitter. So what are people doing? Well, a lot of people, a lot of people actually are checking out Mastodon so I'm calling this the great Mastodon experiment, because tons of us Python people and actually tons of tech people and tons of other people also are trying out this Mastodon thing and in the back of our mind, it was well like, Yeah, well, Mastodon seems kind of interesting. It's like a sort of maybe alternative to Twitter, but not many people there. Now, there's a lot of people that like, tons of people. I don't know what the numbers are compared to Twitter, of course, but anyway, so I am part of this. I'm part of the people that have switched but but if you like I'm we're showing the mastodon like, join mastodon.org site. And the first thing you want to do, okay, I want to try this. So I have to Okay, I have to create an account. So you the first thing you hit is, well, which server Do you want to use? I was stuck here for a while and I'm like, I don't know what to do. So I went ahead and use Twitter and I asked and will was there from Will said he's on Mastodon dot social, Wilma Coogan. And I just asked, I'm still stuck on the to the server, what are people using? And I got one reply right away saying, Well, foster.org has Anthony Shaw and a bunch of other people and like, good enough for me. So I went ahead and picked it. So I am now on foster Dawn also. And then I'm just trying stuff. I'm like just trying it out playing it, playing with it following some people, commenting, whatever. And so far, I kinda like it. It's, it's nice. Now now that I've kind of like I got the basics down. Now I'm ready to learn some more. And, and so I put together went through and found some tutorials. So if anybody else wants to try this also, I found some kind of fun tutorials. There's one that's called the increasingly less brief guide to mastodon. It's big. But it's it's so that's nice, though. It starts out with like, with like, short answers, like, you know, what is it? How is it like Twitter, I was at not like Twitter, stuff like that. And one of the things comparisons that confused me a bit was how was it like email, but I didn't get the analogy at first, but I kind of do now. So the idea is you have to pick a server, but you can still follow people on other servers. Just like if you have a Gmail account, you can still email people that are not in Gmail works. So there's that there's everything I know about.

00:09:58 It reminds me a little bit of like BB SS members go to BBs and write email and then they would like sync at night. And then you might get email from some Yeah, yes.

00:10:06 Well, yeah, that's something I also noticed that first I was a little annoyed because like it's not a zippy sometimes like it's growing a lot so a lot of these servers are like adding capacity. And so occasionally like the the other day, the foster Dawn server was down for a couple hours and I'm like, oh my god, actually, I'll be fine if I don't use a social media app for two hours. Just chill. And so yeah, it's a it's i It's interesting. There's not there's a lot of stuff I've learned so far. Like there's it's not filtering what I'm seeing. I actually just see everything that people write that I'm following actually isn't that what I wanted? So I'm pretty okay with it. So I put together a go through a couple of these there's everything I know it's for a targeted towards data science people but there's a lot of great info there. There's and then Simon Wilson, he's trying this out, too said is Mastodon is just blogs. So I was confused by that. But he describes how it's how it's like it uses this active pub feature and gets into a little details, but I think he knows what he's talking about. Because he wrote his own. He's on his own server so you can have your own. You can have your own Mastodon server, but some of the people trying it out at the same time. We've got some big names Lukas Langa. He's trying it out. He linked to a couple things like that he's learning about, you know, it's really supposed to repost in multiple places, things like that. I've got Brett cannon figuring it out. So a lot of us over here having a little bit of fun with Mastodon

00:11:42 so that's fantastic. Yeah, so Foster dawn.org is the free and open source software Mastodon one right

00:11:50 yeah, but a lot of people are on so like a lot of people are in Mastodon dot social. Here's a cool article. Oh, yeah. I clients wise, there's there's a whole bunch of iPhone clients too. But you can use it on the web or anything. Lucas Lucas is on ER locash Look at I'm sorry, is on Mastodon social, also, Brett spreads on fostered on, but there's a whole bunch of others as well. So

00:12:15 yeah, I you have to apply to get in there. So I applied, but I have not been led in yet. So hopefully, they will find me worthy and I can join you.

00:12:23 Okay. See, I know some of them. So some of them are, since these are private things. There's got like people running their own servers. There's, there's funding models on each of them. And like Foster's on for instance, said they want to make sure that they always have six months of running time, or something like that. And that's cool enough for me. So anyway,

00:12:46 yeah, I'd be happy to pay $1 or two a month is to have no ads and have a well curated somewhat not terrible space,

00:12:54 you know, yeah, it wasn't really getting to get into the politics of it. But the whole $8 A month thing. Actually, if I could have got rid of ads and actually got some other cool features, I probably would have paid it anyway. I just don't want to pay it now. But like two months ago, I probably would have a bit up for it. But I didn't want to do that right now.

00:13:11 Yeah, I don't I have no intention of leaving Twitter at the moment. There's still like a really valuable community for the podcast listeners and stuff. But I do think it's also super interesting to reach out to these other spaces. Mastodon is one it's, it's kind of interesting in that it's, there's a bunch of little islands. And the thing that's cool about Twitter is you go to the continent, and then you find your space within that. It's like here you got to have what is the like the place I go to? I'm telling you this is like BBs is like what what BBs has the place where there's kind of cool conversations and good games I can play and you dial that one up.

00:13:45 Or we can just go back to like, you know, playing in Python and RSS feeds for everybody.

00:13:50 Yeah, nothing wrong with RSS. Cool. Well, thanks for bringing that up. I have some more thoughts on this, as well later. But for now, for now, maybe we could talk about our, our sponsor, do you think we

00:14:00 should talk about our sponsor, because it's cool that we have one but also, it's Microsoft. So this episode of Python bytes is brought to you by Microsoft for startups. But starting a business a business is hard. Most startups go out of business within the first year which is totally lame. So Microsoft for startups set out to understand what startups need to be successful and created a digital platform to help you overcome those challenges. And they came up with Microsoft for startups founders hub, the founders have provides all founders at any stage with free resources to help solve startup challenges. The platform provides technology benefits, access to expert guidance and skilled resources, mentorship and network connections and so much more. Unlike others in the industry. Microsoft for startup founders hub doesn't require startups to be investor backed or third party validated to participate. founders have is truly open to all. You can speed up development with free access to GitHub and Microsoft Cloud. and other, there's there's other partners that they partners with such as open AI, you get discounts through there. So you'll have access to those extra resources. But you also get access to their mentorship network, which includes hundreds of mentors across a range of disciplines need advice on marketing, fundraising, idea, validation, maybe tons of topics that you might need help on, including management and coaching. And you'll be able to book a one to one meeting one on one meeting with mentors, many of whom were former founders themselves. It's no longer about who you know, get critical support you need from Microsoft for startups founders hub, make your idea a reality today, to join the program, visit Python bytes.fm founders hub 2022. And that link is in the show notes. And I know you can find this on your own by googling but using that link in the show notes will help them know that you found it through this podcast. Thanks. Yeah,

00:15:54 absolutely. Thank you, Microsoft. Oh, you're on mute. I am. Thank you, Microsoft. And yeah, let's let's move on. A couple of these things are about continued journeys. Sometimes we're on a journey, you know. Yeah. And watch it over theory over on Twitter, not Mastodon yet. Sent Me sent us a message and said, Hey, nice episode. You know, remember I was on this I talked about like, panics SSH thing called prompt and some of the other ways I was trying to like, Well, how do I just take my iPad and no keyboards and no extra stuff and just have a little devas? opsi coding? Oh, yeah. environment, right. So theory says you should check out get pod Have you heard of get pod? No, no partisan pods from Kubernetes. But here, he says basically illogical up and show you what it is. So if you go over here, the idea is it says always ready to code. Like that sounds cool, right? And I look at this little graphic, right? Okay, you're like, your chairs and enter button. I love it. Oh, I

00:16:58 didn't notice that reverse. That's cool. Yeah. And by

00:17:00 the way, they just this happened, I think since this got sent over, they just raised a $25 million Series A round. So there's a good there's a lot of effort behind this right? Get hot is I believe there's an open source version, and then like a hosted version as well. So the idea is, what you can do is I can go and it'll create a Kubernetes Docker type image that I can configure. So basically a Linux machine that's isolated for me, which is nice. And then I can log into it one of two ways, I can log into it in the browser. And just just like, if you go to GitHub dot Dev, which is what I suggested before in the browser, this connects to your own environment, which the thing that's cool about this is it's that environment, you have root access to do whatever you want to it. So if you got to pip install something, and that's weird or whatever, like, you're not like, oh, well, sorry, you can't install this dependency too bad, right? It's just it's yours, you do whatever you want with it, that's in the browser. So on your iPad browser, for example. Or if you happen to be on the desktop, and what you want is just like a, I'm on an arm machine, I want an x86 machine, or I want a Linux machine that's like production. And that is not just my Mac or my Windows machine, you can actually connect to it with a full on VS code or even pi charm, you can plug directly into it and remotely edit locally on on Patreon locally, but then, like debug and run your environment there. Wow, that that's really cool. Yeah, it also works for IntelliJ. The go basically all the all the VS code, and all the PI, the JetBrains IDE, which is like a huge long list and Vim and also Vim. Wow, no. Anyway, this is really cool. And there's one of the recommendations or like reasons for it, it says look, you can do multitrack development. So if I'm doing like a, I'm working on a feature branch, and I'm working on Main Dev, and I'm trying to do a bug fix instead of, you know, staging, or stashing and then checking out and then try that and unstack you know, check over to other things on stat like juggling one working environment, you can have multiples of these get pods, one for each part of your project, even bring it closer to your Linux and Docker runtime, you can even do like pair programming on it, which is kind of interesting. And here they got an example of it running on an iPad and apparently you could install like a bunch of different extensions and stuff and like configure up your your things so there's an open source version, which is free from big tech influence. But there's also you can get their their version on the cloud or you can self hosted or whatever, right and so there is a paid component to this like this, you know, they got $25 million, right it's not just like to set on fire although maybe there's a free version which is gives you 50 hours of of coding a month that's pretty good. Or you can pay $9 a month for 100 hours or there's like other other higher tiers 2540 bucks and stuff but it's open source and there's some free versions and reasonably priced versions and yeah, I think it's it's pretty cool. So they theory for sending it over and you know, it's definitely an option out there.

00:20:04 Yeah. And the Sophos that also is looks like an option as well. Yeah, exactly.

00:20:08 So you can self host, I think you'd basically probably set up a Kubernetes cluster. And like it, it connects and goes against that.

00:20:14 Oh, yeah. Just just throw up a Kubernetes. Cluster. Yeah, exactly.

00:20:17 All right. Well, I haven't I did play around with it. And it worked pretty well. But I haven't done anything serious.

00:20:25 Still looks cool, though. Yeah,

00:20:27 absolutely. All right. What's your last one here?

00:20:30 Oh, last one is a short one. I just wanted to talk about terminal colors. So. So I've got this little, a little pi test plugin called PI test check. And it's got some terminal output. But it does talk about failures. And somebody completely reasonably submitted an issue and said, it'd be cool if these were red. So you could see him easier. And I'm like, Yeah, that would be cool. So what should I do? Well, I kid, you know, well, I want to let you know that I the first thing I thought about was like, throw rich at it. So I can, I can use rich to do to put red in the terminal. And But Rich is rich is awesome. I love rich. But maybe it's a bit of a big hammer for for just the heading one color, I just had a read. So I went looking around a little bit. And there's term color. And there's Colorama. There's other things I ended up, I'm looking at Colorama. Right now, that's what I'm playing with. So Colorama is used by a lot of applications. And one of the reasons why is because it helps with the cross, being able to use colors on both both Windows and everything else. Windows is a little special, it doesn't act like the other stuff. So if to do things a bit special. And I was kind of glad I looked at this because one of the things that came up recently, and one of the new versions is Colorama has a thing called just fix Windows console. It's just a from Colorama import just fixed windows console, and you call that and after you call that then your windows, if you run your application on Windows, it acts just like a normal TTY terminal on Linux or Mac or something, at least in terms of a lot of stuff. The other thing that just fixed windows console, I think I got this right is it's used to have to call it nit. And now you call this other thing, but you can you can call that on Mac also and it just doesn't hurt anything. It's fine. So you can now after you've done that in there's a whole bunch of text here that I just skimmed really briefly, I just wanted it to work. Just call that and then you can use these, these color codes like four, four dot read, for instance. That's what I wanted to some red text. And there I've got it. So after you change, change stuff around, you also have to reset it. So there's a reset code. Now you can do the same thing and it has on their their readme is you can use the hex or whatever color code escape sequences. So backslash 033 bracket 31 M is red, but I don't I think I'll go with the named ones.

00:23:15 How about some constants instead? Yeah.

00:23:18 Yeah, so is this pretty cool. And I think kind of thick. This is where I'm gonna go with with adding red to my district. So if you want just a little bit of color, and nothing that you need rich for Colorama might be what you want. So

00:23:34 nice color Rama is definitely a go to for me when I just went like this needs to be red or green. It just needs to stand out somehow. For sure. It's very cool. Yeah. Cool. Awesome.

00:23:43 All right. Well, that brings us to our extras. Hmm. Yeah, to get any extras.

00:23:47 You know, I do. But see, as some of these are quakes, I'm slightly more so. Roman, right, who often we find here in the live streams as well make make her a beanie. Labine beanie is powering Python bytes that FM, by the way for various various other things. So super awesome. He'd been thinking and so beanie is Pydantic plus MongoDB async. And so there's plenty of reasons why we might want a synchronous API. I'm just in the middle of some script, and I just need to talk to the database real quick. Like do I really need to upgrade this whole thing to handle async code? Should there just be a way to call it there should and so he created a derivative or mirrored version that is like beanie but has a synchronous set of API's instead of asynchronous API's called bonnet, which I don't know the word but it but I think it has something to do with like something to do with the bean. I'm not sure. Anyway, but it's similar to beanie except for you just don't await things right. You just use the pipe Mongo base instead of the motor client under the hood and then you just you know do thing insert or thing dot find one or whatever. So people could check that out if they're into beanie but they don't want the async version.

00:25:01 Yeah, I just looked it up but it is a it's it's a kite type of hat. It's like a Scottish hat.

00:25:09 Okay, well that would explain the, the the icon here. Maybe it looks like a bean but it's actually had Romans here. Hey Rowan. So there's a Scottish word fabulous and we'll McGugan is abundant as a hat worn by old Scottish man lovely. Awesome. And congrats Roman on getting that out there. That's awesome PyCon you brought up PyCon 2023 last week? Yeah, I've got this cool like tile sort of celebration of history on their website, and they tell you that it will be April 19 to 27th. There's a small problem with that though. How actionable is it if I want to go to the conference, and I want to go see the main talks? When do I book my travel?

00:25:51 The whole thing

00:25:52 is awesome. Right I can come to your tutorials and they do the week of Sprint's after. I don't know that's a lot and so I reached out to Twitter and Marietta says tutorials are Wednesdays and Thursdays talks, keynotes. Expo halls are Friday to Sunday and from Monday onwards, those are the spreads Perfect. Perfect. So yesterday while I sit in getting studded winter tires put on my car so I can go to the mountains and not die. I decided to go ahead and book my travel and I'm gonna go the conference we talked about maybe we'll go maybe not I'm gonna go for a whole week. I'm gonna show up on Thursday and leave on the next Thursday maybe be part of the spreads but definitely do a ton of podcasting while I'm there and try to just make it like other people will be spreading. Okay, what I'm gonna be sprinting on podcast episodes.

00:26:35 I gotta decide what I'm gonna do. I haven't decided yet. I'll probably

00:26:40 flights are still pretty cheap right now. They might be like hotels and stuff. I think they're really a lot of variations. Like there was I was like, oh, maybe I'll stay at the Hilton $3,300 Like, yeah, maybe I won't say the hell what else? So I think we were starting to pick it out. Okay. Anyway, thank you maryada for sharing that information. It makes it much easier for us to plan about participating or even just watching PyCon online. Cool. Yeah. All right. Quick shout out to GeForce Now if you've heard of GeForce Now. No. So my daughter is really into gaming these days to play a bunch of like horse riding games and Minecraft and planet Zoo. And there's like a cool, a Jurassic Park thing that's like a Sims but for dinosaurs, and most of these games run on Windows, and we have an Alienware computer, but it's like all set up for my simracing. So it's kind of hard to play games on the don't involve a steering wheel. So it's like, how can I play these games on my PC? I'm like, or my my Mac, right? She has a MacBook Air, like, I don't know. Like, how can I play if I'm not at home and I could stream so we try out GeForce Now basically, it will, they'll give you a high end Windows computer and like a GeForce 3080 And that just streamline that Netflix to your to your PC. And it is super low latency. I mean, it's like, you're really just playing it there. But you're not it's, it's pretty awesome.

00:28:01 Oh, so you're, you can play a game on a remote computer then. And

00:28:06 yeah, or, I mean, you can play on your iPad, or you can play it on your iPhone, or Android, or on your Mac or whatever. And they've got a completely 100% free tier, so it's already was checked out. Anyway. That was a cool techno experience. Two new YouTube videos I released one five days ago when five hours ago. How about that for timing? Nice. So as part of this sort of social media, Twitter madness, and various other things, I've been thinking about this for a while anyway, I'm like, Alright, I really want to try to build up my presence on other areas. And better not just Twitter. And so like, Well, YouTube might be one fun place to sort of build up a community. So I'm starting to add more videos there. Right. So like I've done in the past couple of weeks, I've done four videos, but the last two is a walrus meets of Python, which is fun, that's about the walrus operator. And then the one that came out today is Python GC settings, which shows some insane stuff you can do to tweak the GC a little bit and get crazy better performance.

00:29:02 Nice. The GC being the garbage collector, right? Yes, not reference

00:29:05 counting, which does like 99.9% of Python memory, the point 0.1% or 2.1% whatever is left over like that actually, you often can turn that down because you don't really have cycles that much that get lost and it turns out to have some pretty interesting effects we thought we covered was with Instagram I think I think they wrote an article called dismissing the garbage collector where they literally turned it off in production It was either that or Corp I can't remember which one which company get it but this is kind of like a well let's don't be so aggressive like that. But kind of you know, it's pretty neat. Yeah, nice. People can check those out.

00:29:40 Yeah, so one of the things that I the only extra I've got is I really liked this article from Simon Wilson about what to blog about so a lot of people are to be have a presence somewhere other than Twitter like and maybe right start writing your blog more. And I like this What to blog about With the hill, he goes through a couple of things. One of the things is that today I learned, and I, you know, I actually first when I first encountered the tipl thing I first was like, why not? Why do you need that? Can you just like, just write what you learned anyway, but a lot of people have this paralysis of, if I write how to do something, people are gonna think it's a tutorial. And I don't know how to do everything with this tool, I just learned this little thing of how to do fix my thing. So the T to do the T, il at least is a tag that people will know, it's not a full tutorial, it's just a little snippet of somebody learned about this thing. And, and I think this is a great way to go about writing it it can be, it can be short and simple, or it can be longer. Plus, also, if you build up a lot of these around a topic, it might turn into a tutorial later. So as you can you now that you've learned a ton, you can write a blog or longer blog post about it, I also just want to tell people that it doesn't have to be a like a full tutorial, you don't have to compete with real Python or other places, you can just do a short thing you learned about it doesn't have to be this. Okay. The other thing he talked about was projects is to write about projects that you've done. And, and I think that's a great idea. And but I also want to make sure that people understand also the things you're working on, right, right, as you're building stuff. This can be part of the ti l but it could just be this is the fate. And it's also another way to limit the scope, like coloring the terminal. I don't want to write about all of color in the terminal. But maybe I could write about the just fixing this one bug or this one feature request, what I went through to figure out how to figure out how to use Colorama. And and then how do I detect whether it's a TTY terminal or not. Things like that, that can be a decent article just to write about that. And so I think these this, these are great tips for unblocking yourself. The other thing I want to tell people about is, is if you've covered it, you've learned it from somebody else's blog already, but you didn't quite meet your needs, and you looked at other places. That means that there is a tutorial out there that's missing. It's the one that kind of myth fits your brain, you can rewrite something that is diff is similar to what other people have written about, and just write it in a different way that fits you better. And that'll maybe fit other people better too. So there's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't have to be completely unique. So yeah, absolutely.

00:32:23 Definitely doesn't. I like it. That's all I got. Yeah, came out there says T aisles are also handy to reread from time to time and remind yourself of things you've figured out then forgotten. Like, you can see the search engines with stuff that you knew. And then when you forget it, you can find it again.

00:32:38 And you know, that's how I started blogging, and I didn't call it T IL, I would just add a blog. Nobody was reading. And I would just throw up stuff like commands that I looked up like commands from a tool like, I always forget how to change my commit message if after I've committed too fast. So throwing up a little post about Git commit amend would be fine. Yeah.

00:32:59 Yeah, absolutely. All right. Well, this has been a fun episode. But it's so good sometimes to just take a moment and relax, right? Yeah, yeah. I mean, some people I took my dog for a walk in the woods during sunrise, it was like this fog, that some for some people getting out in nature is amazing. But as software developers, a lot of times you want to get kind of close to the code or like close to the heart of technology. And what speaks heart attack terminology more than the server.

00:33:26 This is crazy, man. So So here's a thing you

00:33:29 can play. It's on YouTube, I'll show you in a second. And it says pure relaxation server sounds. So we can come over here. And it actually has tracks. So like, it starts with desktop and the drum drum entering the engine in the engine room, the far side of the cloud. I find colocation ventilation to be especially relaxing, facing facing the cloud. And finally spacewalk, so I just want to play a little bit of this for people Ryan, I think I think they're gonna enjoy it. Maybe

00:34:03 it's amazing, right? So relaxing. So anyway,

00:34:07 you shared it with me before we started though, and I gotta say, it's hilarious. So I'm gonna go check this out.

00:34:13 I mean, keep in mind, a lot of people have to wear like big earmuffs sound protection to go in this room. So it might be the opposite of relaxing, but you'll see

00:34:22 you'll see. Okay, cool. Nice. Fine.

00:34:25 All right. Yeah, thanks. Just here to help people be more productive, you know, maybe not with us though.

00:34:30 Well, in some of these people that used to be around these all these server firms are now working from home and they might miss that sound. So

00:34:36 that's that's true. Good Roman out that points out that the scary part is actually if the server room is quiet. Why is it quiet? This is not good. Night. All right.

00:34:48 Well, thanks a lot for as always, and thank everybody for watching and showing up and listening. We love you.

00:34:56 And thanks, everyone. It's been awesome six years and we'll we'll keep going. Yeah, Bye bye
