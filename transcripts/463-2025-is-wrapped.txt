00:00:00 <v Brian Okken>Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, <v Brian Okken>where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:00:05 <v Brian Okken>This is episode 463, recorded December 22, 2025.

00:00:10 <v Brian Okken>I'm Brian Okken.

00:00:11 <v Brian Okken>And I am Michael Kennedy.

00:00:12 <v Brian Okken>And this episode is sponsored by us.

00:00:14 <v Brian Okken>So support us by heading over to Michael's courses, <v Brian Okken>my courses, Talk Python Training or python test.com,

00:00:24 <v Brian Okken>or just go over and see what we got at the pythonbytes.fm.

00:00:29 <v Brian Okken>Let me add one more thing real quick there, Brian. Sorry to hijack your intro, but hey,

00:00:34 <v Michael Kennedy>we're coming up on 2026 and it's about time to be scheduling sponsors on the ad calendar for the

00:00:41 <v Michael Kennedy>next year. So if companies out there, if you're listening, you're like, why does my company not

00:00:45 <v Michael Kennedy>support Python Bytes and sponsor it? Yes, a fine question you should be taking up with your

00:00:50 <v Michael Kennedy>marketing team. Have them reach out to me. And right now there's a bunch of openings. We'll see

00:00:54 <v Michael Kennedy>if they get bought up or not as things go.

00:00:57 <v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, just send me an email.

00:00:58 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, actually, that'd be great.

00:01:00 <v Brian Okken>I'd love to have more sponsors on the show.

00:01:04 <v Brian Okken>If you want to reach us for sponsoring <v Brian Okken>or any other ways,

00:01:11 <v Brian Okken>there's links on the show page, pythonbytes.fm.

00:01:16 <v Brian Okken>You can also find links to all of our socials.

00:01:19 <v Brian Okken>We're at Mastodon and Fosstodon, <v Brian Okken>both us individually and the show.

00:01:24 <v Brian Okken>And also, if you'd like to watch us live, <v Brian Okken>you can go to pythonbytes.com/live

00:01:31 <v Brian Okken>and see what it is and find the links.

00:01:37 <v Brian Okken>so we can send you all the links we talk about <v Brian Okken>directly to your inbox.

00:01:41 <v Brian Okken>Alrighty, oh, one more thing before we get started.

00:01:44 <v Brian Okken>We are taking, normally we record on Monday mornings <v Brian Okken>and we are taking next week off

00:01:51 <v Brian Okken>and we will be back in 2026.

00:01:54 <v Michael Kennedy>All right. Kick us off, Michael.

00:01:56 <v Michael Kennedy>It's end of the year. As you said, we'll be back first week of January.

00:02:02 <v Michael Kennedy>But it's a little bit of an introspective end of the year is what I want to leave people with.

00:02:07 <v Michael Kennedy>So people may have noticed I usually cover tools, libraries, or updates to those kinds of things and so on.

00:02:14 <v Michael Kennedy>But on this episode, I want to cover two articles that I came across recently that I think they'll make you think.

00:02:20 <v Michael Kennedy>They'll make you really evaluate the situation.

00:02:23 <v Michael Kennedy>One has to do with agentic coding and one has to do with why open source won and continues to win.

00:02:30 <v Michael Kennedy>But more importantly, what is one of the really key ingredients?

00:02:34 <v Michael Kennedy>So as we look towards the future for more sustainability, let's not kill the golden goose by changing that thing.

00:02:40 <v Michael Kennedy>So the first one is, has the cost of building software just dropped 90 percent?

00:02:46 <v Michael Kennedy>That's a pretty stark headline, isn't it?

00:02:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:02:49 <v Michael Kennedy>And what are the consequences? Right.

00:02:50 <v Michael Kennedy>Does that mean, does that mean like, well, you thought it was hard to get a job earlier as a junior and just hang on to your pants now?

00:02:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Or does it mean something else?

00:02:58 <v Michael Kennedy>We'll see.

00:02:58 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, at least we'll see what Martin Alderson said, because that's the article.

00:03:02 <v Michael Kennedy>He wrote this article and I think it is super insightful and interesting.

00:03:06 <v Michael Kennedy>So I kind of want to just pull out some highlights and put it out there for you all to think about as you got some downtime.

00:03:10 <v Michael Kennedy>So the premise is basically that many of the recent programming quote advancements that are like gonna change the world, gonna actually absolutely change the way things work, haven't really.

00:03:23 <v Michael Kennedy>For example, test-driven development, cloud computing, especially hyperscale clouds, microservices, complex front ends like React and so on, Angular, whatever.

00:03:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Kubernetes, sure, they're advancements and they help in some way or another for various things,

00:03:38 <v Michael Kennedy>but they're not bending the curve dramatically on how we write software, how much more we get done,

00:03:43 <v Michael Kennedy>and so on. Somewhat, but not massively. But they say, let me see if I can find it. Yeah, here we go.

00:03:50 <v Michael Kennedy>The economics have dramatically changed now with agentic coding. And I agree. I think it really

00:03:57 <v Michael Kennedy>has. And I know a lot of people are frustrated with AI or they don't want to use AI and so on.

00:04:02 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm not here to make people do that, but I am here to put on your radar that this is something you're going to have to be paying attention to.

00:04:08 <v Michael Kennedy>And Martin thinks so as well.

00:04:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Says in 2026 is going to catch a lot of people off guard.

00:04:13 <v Michael Kennedy>And I think so too.

00:04:14 <v Michael Kennedy>So it kind of goes through the history a little bit of like changes, how open source actually made a huge change, how cloud was supposed to make a big change, but it just added a crap ton of complexity.

00:04:25 <v Michael Kennedy>A lot of other things.

00:04:26 <v Michael Kennedy>So in a lot of just sort of how complexity has grown over time, instead of these things

00:04:31 <v Michael Kennedy>making us able to write more software or better software, a lot of times it's just handle

00:04:35 <v Michael Kennedy>more complex software or kind of doing the same thing.

00:04:37 <v Michael Kennedy>So where's the 90% savings come from?

00:04:41 <v Michael Kennedy>So he says, like you, probably I was incredibly skeptical of a lot of AI coding tools at the

00:04:46 <v Michael Kennedy>beginning of the year, but things are changing fast.

00:04:49 <v Michael Kennedy>And previously, if I want to, let's say I want to add some small capability to my app.

00:04:55 <v Michael Kennedy>How do you do it?

00:04:55 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, you're going to assemble a team of people.

00:04:57 <v Michael Kennedy>You're going to set up continuous integration.

00:04:59 <v Michael Kennedy>You're going to build out data access patterns, <v Michael Kennedy>and you're going to plan that out in an architecture meeting.

00:05:03 <v Michael Kennedy>Really, it's just a bunch of crud, but people make a big deal out of it.

00:05:06 <v Michael Kennedy>So you're going to over-engineer it probably.

00:05:10 <v Michael Kennedy>And you're going to set up some testing and so on.

00:05:12 <v Michael Kennedy>And that's just direct labor, right?

00:05:13 <v Michael Kennedy>You've got all the management.

00:05:14 <v Michael Kennedy>And one of the things that's really interesting about this article

00:05:17 <v Michael Kennedy>is the mythical man month aspect of this.

00:05:20 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, okay, well, that's going to take two weeks.

00:05:21 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, what if we add four people to it?

00:05:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, it'll take one and a half weeks.

00:05:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, wait, why is that not half a week?

00:05:26 <v Michael Kennedy>You know, it's like the coordination, the communication,

00:05:29 <v Michael Kennedy>the in factorial ways in which there can be like blocking

00:05:33 <v Michael Kennedy>or communication or meetings or coordination and so on.

00:05:37 <v Michael Kennedy>And so these coding tools have got really, really good.

00:05:39 <v Michael Kennedy>And as you add one of these coding tools in, <v Michael Kennedy>you don't have to have meetings with it.

00:05:45 <v Michael Kennedy>You don't have to have it working with three other ones of them

00:05:48 <v Michael Kennedy>so that it can coordinate different skill sets and so on.

00:05:51 <v Michael Kennedy>And so in a sense, it really lowers the number of connections in that mythical man month,

00:05:56 <v Michael Kennedy>but still adds a lot of capabilities.

00:05:57 <v Michael Kennedy>So pretty interesting.

00:05:58 <v Michael Kennedy>So final takeaway is like on the face of it, this seems like incredibly bad news for the

00:06:02 <v Michael Kennedy>software development industry.

00:06:04 <v Michael Kennedy>Indeed.

00:06:05 <v Michael Kennedy>But a look at history.

00:06:07 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's see.

00:06:08 <v Michael Kennedy>So Jevons paradox comes from back in the day when coal usage became super efficient, right?

00:06:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Instead of just burning it in an open pit or whatever to like heat something, we put it

00:06:21 <v Michael Kennedy>know the steam engines and it does way more work per you know joule of energy or whatever right

00:06:27 <v Michael Kennedy>it says look at least this guy martin thinks this applies jevon's paradox also is going to apply to

00:06:32 <v Michael Kennedy>software that when something becomes cheaper to produce it's not that we just use it less it's

00:06:37 <v Michael Kennedy>like well we've got five developers but now they're way more efficient so let's get rid of four of them

00:06:42 <v Michael Kennedy>that's one possible outcome the other is like let's just build five times as much software

00:06:46 <v Michael Kennedy>as we used to, right?

00:06:47 <v Michael Kennedy>And so an example is from history <v Michael Kennedy>is when coal became way cheaper,

00:06:52 <v Michael Kennedy>its use skyrocketed, <v Michael Kennedy>not cheaper, efficient, right?

00:06:56 <v Michael Kennedy>Like you didn't need to spend as much coal <v Michael Kennedy>to get stuff done.

00:06:59 <v Michael Kennedy>But in fact, it actually blew up way, way more.

00:07:02 <v Michael Kennedy>So super interesting.

00:07:03 <v Michael Kennedy>And I think there's something to that.

00:07:04 <v Michael Kennedy>I think there's a ton of latent demand for software.

00:07:08 <v Michael Kennedy>So anyway, there's a whole section on that <v Michael Kennedy>that's pretty interesting, I think.

00:07:12 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I think there is a lot of, <v Brian Okken>I've mixed emotions about this.

00:07:17 <v Brian Okken>I think there is a lot of light in demand.

00:07:19 <v Brian Okken>I am dealing with both agent-driven or agent-developed software on a professional basis,

00:07:27 <v Brian Okken>both from experts and from novices in a company.

00:07:33 <v Brian Okken>And it's producing five times as much code, but you get five times as much bad code from

00:07:39 <v Brian Okken>bad developers.

00:07:41 <v Brian Okken>I'm just saying, there is a, like, let's say we have five times the amount of code or five times the product, you know, do more things.

00:07:50 <v Brian Okken>That's 5xing your code base that you have to maintain in the future, too.

00:07:55 <v Brian Okken>And we really haven't figured out how to deal with the increased maintenance cost of this agent-driven software yet.

00:08:04 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I agree with that.

00:08:06 <v Brian Okken>Also, the test-driven development, I think we didn't get the gains out of that because people were teaching it wrong.

00:08:14 <v Brian Okken>Just kind of a point from my book.

00:08:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Of course.

00:08:17 <v Michael Kennedy>But I think also there's a difference between full-on extreme programming and just, hey, let's make sure we have tests for our code.

00:08:25 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, there's also, should we test our code and should we unit test it?

00:08:28 <v Brian Okken>And that's the big part that I get.

00:08:32 <v Brian Okken>But also, can we scroll up to that complexity chart?

00:08:36 <v Brian Okken>or the little graph, <v Brian Okken>I think that AI agents are going to not drive down complexity.

00:08:42 <v Brian Okken>I think we might get efficiency gains, <v Brian Okken>but I don't think,

00:08:47 <v Brian Okken>I think we're going to get some, <v Brian Okken>the complexity is going to go up just like it did with cloud.

00:08:52 <v Michael Kennedy>You know, what's really interesting about all this discussion,

00:08:54 <v Michael Kennedy>and I'm not disagreeing with you on this.

00:08:56 <v Michael Kennedy>I think it's, <v Michael Kennedy>if people have the opinion that are just going to like cut,

00:09:01 <v Michael Kennedy>set these things loose on code bases, <v Michael Kennedy>or especially on greenfield projects,

00:09:05 <v Michael Kennedy>you're going to end up with all sorts of mishmashes of stuff.

00:09:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, oh, this time it decided it wanted to react, <v Michael Kennedy>but last time it used Vue.

00:09:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, now I have to know two frameworks.

00:09:13 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, why am I doing this, right?

00:09:15 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:09:16 <v Michael Kennedy>There are a bunch of engineering practices and tools <v Michael Kennedy>to apply to this stuff to get much more constrained,

00:09:23 <v Michael Kennedy>uniform output out of it than just letting it go free, right?

00:09:26 <v Michael Kennedy>And also, to Martin's defense, he says, like, look, <v Michael Kennedy>this is not vibe coding.

00:09:30 <v Michael Kennedy>This is not just letting the thing go.

00:09:32 <v Michael Kennedy>This is, like, engineer plus...

00:09:34 <v Michael Kennedy>Working with it.

00:09:35 <v Michael Kennedy>these tools right like human in the loop all the way and even if we can get like your expert

00:09:40 <v Brian Okken>engineers at your company to work twice as fat like get twice as much productivity out of them

00:09:44 <v Brian Okken>and they're going to actually be happier because they're um it's like they've got a second brain

00:09:50 <v Brian Okken>working with them even 2x like is incredible to get incredible yeah to get your best engineers

00:09:58 <v Brian Okken>um to get to figure out stuff faster also um even not generating code but even just having stuff

00:10:05 <v Brian Okken>explain it to you. Like, how does this algorithm work? What should I care about?

00:10:09 <v Brian Okken>Asking it what tests you should write, asking it where the problem areas might be. Those are

00:10:15 <v Brian Okken>incredible things that we couldn't do before without trying to pull other people off of their

00:10:20 <v Michael Kennedy>own projects. So, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So two more thoughts before we wrap this up quickly.

00:10:27 <v Michael Kennedy>One down at the bottom here talks about, hold on before I lose track of where I was. Yeah,

00:10:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Greenfield. Okay. So one objection is just not in a header sort of thing. One objection that I hear

00:10:37 <v Michael Kennedy>a lot is LLMs are only good at Greenfield projects. And you were kind of talking about that as well,

00:10:43 <v Michael Kennedy>Brian, but I actually strongly disagree with this based on my experience. And so does Martin,

00:10:48 <v Michael Kennedy>by the way. Yeah, I do too. So I think when you turn an agentic LLM loose on a Greenfield project,

00:10:55 <v Michael Kennedy>it just does whatever is popular on the internet that it's done, or it thinks it's trained on or

00:11:00 <v Michael Kennedy>whatever, when you turn it loose on a greenfield project, if you're careful and you set up the

00:11:04 <v Michael Kennedy>guidelines, it can follow the same patterns that are already established in the code and use the

00:11:08 <v Michael Kennedy>same libraries and use the same techniques. And I just used, I spent, I would say probably an hour

00:11:15 <v Michael Kennedy>coming up with a prompt to do a security review for some of my code, an hour before I started,

00:11:22 <v Michael Kennedy>even before I try that, working on exactly what I wanted it to do, how I wanted to do it,

00:11:28 <v Michael Kennedy>how I wanted to go about fixing it.

00:11:30 <v Michael Kennedy>And I got what looks like top tier security pen testing analysis on a code base.

00:11:36 <v Michael Kennedy>And I thought that is awesome.

00:11:38 <v Michael Kennedy>And that's because it was not a greenfield project.

00:11:40 <v Michael Kennedy>It was thousands and thousands of lines of code that had been around for a long time

00:11:44 <v Michael Kennedy>with established patterns of solving things.

00:11:46 <v Michael Kennedy>And it was very, very, very good.

00:11:48 <v Michael Kennedy>So yeah, I would like to put it on the world that that is when done right.

00:11:53 <v Michael Kennedy>That is not, I think greenfield projects are less good, not better.

00:11:56 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:11:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Because they have nothing to go on.

00:11:58 <v Michael Kennedy>right they just go on whatever they feel like i haven't really done a lot of greenfield on

00:12:03 <v Brian Okken>stuff i think greenfield for for throwaway code or for just like uh like scripts that you it just has

00:12:10 <v Brian Okken>to get the job done sort of the internal thing i think those are fine but um oh gosh i had an

00:12:16 <v Brian Okken>incredible recent experience with just um getting stuck on an algorithm that was too slow and uh

00:12:23 <v Brian Okken>i spent an hour with an llm uh and an agent um trying to um get it faster and it was like an

00:12:31 <v Brian Okken>intense hour you know yeah exactly and then i just threw it in a branch and slept on it and

00:12:37 <v Brian Okken>came back the next day and made spent another hour trying to make sure i understood all of it

00:12:43 <v Brian Okken>and i and um and tweaking it more there were some non-pythonic things that i got rid of it had

00:12:48 <v Brian Okken>recursion in there and i'm like let's get rid of that and we actually made it faster than we did

00:12:53 <v Brian Okken>before so spending a like don't don't stop with it works go a little bit further to make sure that

00:12:59 <v Brian Okken>you can maintain it in the future it doesn't take that much extra time and you're going to still be

00:13:03 <v Brian Okken>proud of it and it was an incredible experience and i'm definitely going to do that again so yeah

00:13:09 <v Michael Kennedy>definitely should be partners like a like a super excited coding buddy not not just a junior you just

00:13:16 <v Brian Okken>send stuff to and make it go and then i but i also spent some time an hour recently or two

00:13:22 <v Brian Okken>reviewing some test code from a junior developer and i obviously this stuff was just spit out by a

00:13:30 <v Brian Okken>agent and um and it didn't make sense and i and so it just took time away for me to review bad code

00:13:39 <v Brian Okken>and that's going to take away from your experts as well so yeah yeah that's a very good

00:13:44 <v Brian Okken>Good point.

00:13:45 <v Brian Okken>It is indeed.

00:13:47 <v Brian Okken>All right.

00:13:47 <v Brian Okken>We should have a warning or something about that, Brian.

00:13:49 <v Brian Okken>A warning, yeah.

00:13:50 <v Brian Okken>So last episode, we talked about deprecation warnings.

00:13:55 <v Brian Okken>And I have to admit, I didn't do enough research on that.

00:13:59 <v Brian Okken>So I'm glad that listeners chimed in.

00:14:01 <v Brian Okken>We got a couple of listener feedbacks.

00:14:03 <v Brian Okken>One of them I'm going to credit because we got his email right up here.

00:14:06 <v Brian Okken>John Hagan mentioned you should totally use from warnings, import deprecated,

00:14:12 <v Brian Okken>And instead of calling your own, calling warn, use the decorator deprecating.

00:14:17 <v Brian Okken>And I totally, now after playing with it, totally agree.

00:14:21 <v Brian Okken>It's awesome.

00:14:21 <v Brian Okken>So let's back up a little bit.

00:14:23 <v Brian Okken>We started with this Seth Larson article about deprecations via warnings don't work for Python libraries.

00:14:29 <v Brian Okken>And I kind of agree after experimenting because I played with it a bit.

00:14:35 <v Brian Okken>And one of the things that I found out was in, so in the Python documentation, one of the things that's cool.

00:14:42 <v Brian Okken>somebody mentioned this and I didn't really know about it is development mode.

00:14:45 <v Brian Okken>So there's dash X dev and you can also set it with a Python dev mode environmental variable.

00:14:52 <v Brian Okken>And it sets a bunch of stuff, including setting the default warnings to W.

00:14:57 <v Brian Okken>And the reason why that's important, I'm like, why is that important?

00:15:00 <v Brian Okken>The reason is important in Seth alludes to it, but doesn't point it out directly,

00:15:05 <v Brian Okken>is in the dash WR argument for Python, you could say just ignore,

00:15:11 <v Brian Okken>like ignore all warnings.

00:15:13 <v Brian Okken>And I think it's just, <v Brian Okken>you can either ignore all warnings

00:15:16 <v Brian Okken>or it even tells you, for example, <v Brian Okken>to ignore all your deprecation warnings,

00:15:20 <v Brian Okken>do this.

00:15:21 <v Brian Okken>Ouch, I kind of wish they hadn't mentioned that.

00:15:25 <v Brian Okken>Don't encourage people, come on.

00:15:27 <v Brian Okken>Don't encourage people.

00:15:28 <v Brian Okken>Instead of ignore, somebody else, <v Brian Okken>and then again, sorry for whoever mentioned this,

00:15:33 <v Brian Okken>but somebody mentioned just use once.

00:15:36 <v Brian Okken>Ignore, like dash W once makes any warning <v Brian Okken>in your code show up once and not a whole bunch of times.

00:15:43 <v Brian Okken>And it's the whole bunch of times that I think people turn it off for because it fills up

00:15:47 <v Brian Okken>your CI logs and everything like that.

00:15:49 <v Brian Okken>But you really should see it at least once.

00:15:51 <v Brian Okken>I like the once.

00:15:51 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what else I like about once?

00:15:53 <v Michael Kennedy>The W once is the pronunciation is the same as just once.

00:15:57 <v Brian Okken>That's just once.

00:15:58 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:16:00 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:16:00 <v Brian Okken>So I played with it.

00:16:01 <v Brian Okken>I looked at this deprecation warning thing.

00:16:04 <v Brian Okken>And we'll link to the documentation in Python as well.

00:16:10 <v Brian Okken>But you can do it, combine both solutions, which I love.

00:16:15 <v Brian Okken>So you can just go ahead and declare your own warning and use the deprecated.

00:16:20 <v Brian Okken>And so I tried this out.

00:16:24 <v Brian Okken>So what you do is you just say, create your own, just a class and derive it from user warning.

00:16:31 <v Brian Okken>And you don't have to import anything for this.

00:16:32 <v Brian Okken>This is just built in.

00:16:34 <v Brian Okken>It doesn't have to do anything, just a passing class.

00:16:36 <v Brian Okken>But then if you use this deprecated decorator and pass your new warning category as deprecated,

00:16:49 <v Brian Okken>and this sounds complicated on the air, it's not.

00:16:53 <v Brian Okken>We'll do a code example.

00:16:55 <v Brian Okken>But what you get is this, I had it, warning both.

00:17:01 <v Brian Okken>Oh, yeah, it's over just right on the same screenshot.

00:17:04 <v Brian Okken>The cool thing is that mypy and other type checkers, when you use the deprecated, will flag that it's a problem.

00:17:13 <v Brian Okken>And I was doing it.

00:17:14 <v Brian Okken>I think PyCharm does the same thing, but I was doing it in VS Code.

00:17:19 <v Brian Okken>And what happens if you've got this deprecated decorator is that the IDE will just cross it out.

00:17:25 <v Brian Okken>And they're like, why is this crossed out?

00:17:26 <v Brian Okken>And if you hover over it, it'll say, oh, this is deprecated.

00:17:29 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, it's like a strikethrough.

00:17:30 <v Michael Kennedy>It says, don't use it.

00:17:31 <v Michael Kennedy>I love it.

00:17:32 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, it's very visual and it will make you like look at it.

00:17:36 <v Brian Okken>So I think that instead of just calling more and yeah, please use the deprecated.

00:17:42 <v Brian Okken>And then I was playing with pytest as well.

00:17:45 <v Brian Okken>And what did we get?

00:17:47 <v Brian Okken>I wrote it down in the show notes.

00:17:50 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, you want to pass in the dash W just like you would for Python.

00:17:54 <v Brian Okken>If you do dash W error within pytest, at least in one of your tests to find out actually all of the tests.

00:18:02 <v Brian Okken>So that'll turn.

00:18:03 <v Brian Okken>Well, even by default, pytest will warn you and do the warnings.

00:18:07 <v Brian Okken>But if you're in CI, maybe you're not watching those.

00:18:10 <v Brian Okken>So in CI, having a check for those deprecation warnings with dash W error will flag all those failures.

00:18:18 <v Brian Okken>So anyway, lots of great information from readers.

00:18:22 <v Brian Okken>So thank you for listening.

00:18:24 <v Michael Kennedy>We got, if they read the newsletter you send, they could be readers.

00:18:29 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, they could be readers.

00:18:31 <v Michael Kennedy>John pointed out that you can set an environment variable,

00:18:34 <v Michael Kennedy>and people may be hesitant to just set an environment variable for their computer

00:18:40 <v Michael Kennedy>to turn Python into dev mode, which makes it slower potentially.

00:18:44 <v Michael Kennedy>But if you create a virtual environment, which you should be doing,

00:18:48 <v Michael Kennedy>there's an activation script in that virtual environment,

00:18:51 <v Michael Kennedy>And you can just go and export that environment variable

00:18:56 <v Michael Kennedy>set to debug or whatever mode you want to set it to.

00:18:59 <v Michael Kennedy>- Oh yeah.

00:19:00 <v Michael Kennedy>- Only when you activate that virtual environment.

00:19:02 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you're on a particular project, <v Michael Kennedy>you're like this one really,

00:19:05 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't care about speed right now, <v Michael Kennedy>I just care about getting things right.

00:19:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Tweak its virtual environment, <v Michael Kennedy>that doesn't have really many knock on effects.

00:19:11 <v Michael Kennedy>So that's a cool hack I think.

00:19:13 <v Brian Okken>- Yeah, it's a great place to throw in <v Brian Okken>temporary pytest flags as well or any runtime flags.

00:19:19 <v Brian Okken>- Exactly, it's not just about <v Michael Kennedy>This dev thing, like it's like a little shell script basically.

00:19:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:19:25 <v Michael Kennedy>Indeed.

00:19:26 <v Michael Kennedy>You could do it for open source things, Brian.

00:19:27 <v Michael Kennedy>I love open source.

00:19:29 <v Michael Kennedy>So, oh yeah.

00:19:30 <v Michael Kennedy>So here's another article.

00:19:31 <v Michael Kennedy>And this one is by Thomas Dupree called How Foss One and Why It Matters.

00:19:36 <v Michael Kennedy>This is a pretty interesting article.

00:19:38 <v Michael Kennedy>And what it looks at open source, free and open source software angle from is not just

00:19:44 <v Michael Kennedy>why do people like writing open source software?

00:19:46 <v Michael Kennedy>Why do they like it better than having locked away software or having to pay or having bugs you can't fix or black box security issues potentially?

00:19:56 <v Michael Kennedy>As we've seen lately, open source has its whole supply chain story on that.

00:20:00 <v Michael Kennedy>That's different in a different way.

00:20:02 <v Michael Kennedy>But anyway, it really looks at it from why has it won from a company perspective, especially large companies.

00:20:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:20:10 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:20:10 <v Michael Kennedy>So it's really interesting.

00:20:13 <v Michael Kennedy>So it says like, look, why did it win?

00:20:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, people want to pay less.

00:20:19 <v Michael Kennedy>So paying less, aka free software, that's great, right?

00:20:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, how do companies make more money?

00:20:25 <v Michael Kennedy>They either make more profit or they have fewer expenses for a fixed level of profit.

00:20:30 <v Michael Kennedy>So not paying for software is great.

00:20:32 <v Michael Kennedy>But that's not just open source software.

00:20:34 <v Michael Kennedy>That's for everything.

00:20:35 <v Michael Kennedy>And so companies implement what's called cost control.

00:20:38 <v Michael Kennedy>So business term for making buying things painful, hard, and time consuming as possible.

00:20:44 <v Michael Kennedy>So employees will either not or hate doing it.

00:20:47 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:20:48 <v Michael Kennedy>So an example is like, hey, I need a cool date picker for our site that imagine open source doesn't exist.

00:20:54 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, someone's going to have to start by creating a ticket to get this date picker.

00:21:00 <v Michael Kennedy>And then, well, we have to research the various commercial options.

00:21:05 <v Michael Kennedy>We could go to procurement and have them find it.

00:21:07 <v Michael Kennedy>But what do they know about date pickers?

00:21:08 <v Michael Kennedy>So we're going to do that ourself.

00:21:09 <v Michael Kennedy>We're going to get a report.

00:21:10 <v Michael Kennedy>We're going to bring it to procurement.

00:21:13 <v Michael Kennedy>And when we get there, then procurement says, okay, great.

00:21:16 <v Michael Kennedy>You're going to go with this company? Fine.

00:21:17 <v Michael Kennedy>So what we're going to do is first we're going to need to set up a vendor agreement with them

00:21:21 <v Michael Kennedy>because it turns out they're not currently a vendor of ours.

00:21:24 <v Michael Kennedy>So we have contracts, we have reviews, we have negotiations, all for a stupid date picker, right?

00:21:30 <v Michael Kennedy>It's just like, what is going on?

00:21:32 <v Michael Kennedy>And then on top of it, there's all these copyright laws like indemnification of like,

00:21:37 <v Michael Kennedy>you prove you haven't stolen from another company then to resell this to me in like some other way

00:21:42 <v Michael Kennedy>of that stuff, it's like eventually you get permission to buy the thing and then you could

00:21:47 <v Michael Kennedy>start using it. So open source software enters the scene. It says this comes with a pre-agreed,

00:21:52 <v Michael Kennedy>pre-reviewed license, MIT, Apache, whatever. And so the lawyers are already like, yep,

00:21:57 <v Michael Kennedy>we know what that is. We know how to deal with that. There's no pain. So there's no

00:22:01 <v Michael Kennedy>vendor research, vendor approval, contracts, copyright, all that kind of stuff. And so it

00:22:07 <v Michael Kennedy>really interesting like is this hack to skip around this like make buying stuff at companies

00:22:13 <v Brian Okken>super hard right so it wasn't always that way though it took a long time for companies to

00:22:19 <v Brian Okken>realize that open source was fine yes that's for sure i mean they did have to work through it but

00:22:24 <v Michael Kennedy>i think once they kind of it feels like they had to go through this the same process we're kind of

00:22:28 <v Michael Kennedy>describing once in a sort of an abstract sense like okay then well now you can just go you know

00:22:33 <v Michael Kennedy>know what I mean? It says, Hey, look, it also works both ways. If you're a FOSS maintainer,

00:22:39 <v Michael Kennedy>the miracle of your software passing, bypassing copyright laws and liabilities and procurement

00:22:44 <v Michael Kennedy>means that you can get your software out there and have people use it pretty easy, right? Because

00:22:49 <v Michael Kennedy>your stuff is much easier to adopt because it's open source. I mean, I've been on the vendor side

00:22:55 <v Michael Kennedy>of these negotiations and paperwork and accounting and legal more than once. And it sucks. It sucks.

00:23:03 <v Michael Kennedy>I mean, look, Hey, people want to put me in as a vendor and buy stuff.

00:23:06 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm here for it.

00:23:06 <v Michael Kennedy>But at the same time, it is not fun.

00:23:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Right.

00:23:09 <v Michael Kennedy>And there needs to be like, if you're just a hobbyist, like, well, no.

00:23:12 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:23:12 <v Michael Kennedy>So the final bit of this article, the final bit of this thought piece is you can't go back.

00:23:16 <v Michael Kennedy>So if we're trying to solve, if we're trying to solve the sustainability of open source

00:23:22 <v Michael Kennedy>software, you have to keep in mind the reason, one of the main reasons it's so popular is

00:23:27 <v Michael Kennedy>it skipped the copyright rule stuff.

00:23:30 <v Michael Kennedy>It skipped the vendor onboarding and all these things.

00:23:33 <v Michael Kennedy>So if your solution to fix sustainability is to recreate any of the supply chain framework problem, your solution is dead on arrival.

00:23:41 <v Michael Kennedy>So I think that's what this is why I wanted to bring up this article.

00:23:45 <v Michael Kennedy>I put it at the end of the year.

00:23:46 <v Michael Kennedy>It's kind of like I would love to see more sustainability options for open source.

00:23:51 <v Michael Kennedy>But I do think that this guy is on to something here.

00:23:54 <v Michael Kennedy>I do think that Thomas is on to something with his skipping the legal, skipping the procurement.

00:23:59 <v Michael Kennedy>And if we put it back and say, well, you got to set up a vendor agreement with us again.

00:24:02 <v Michael Kennedy>And then you're unraveling a lot of the things that made it a really good fit.

00:24:07 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:24:08 <v Michael Kennedy>The article does a lot more detailed explanation than I did,

00:24:11 <v Michael Kennedy>but they're for people to think about.

00:24:13 <v Brian Okken>I hope this, yeah, I hope we don't go back.

00:24:17 <v Brian Okken>There are pressures to push it back.

00:24:20 <v Brian Okken>Like you were saying, there's the projects that just, they can't,

00:24:24 <v Brian Okken>they know that enterprise is using it and they're not getting paid.

00:24:27 <v Brian Okken>And that isn't as a bummer.

00:24:31 <v Brian Okken>And if you're not charging anything, you can't just make it up in volume.

00:24:37 <v Michael Kennedy>We've tripled our revenue from what it was last year.

00:24:39 <v Brian Okken>Still zero.

00:24:40 <v Brian Okken>With things like trying to secure the supply chain, we are, I mean, even open source is part of the supply chain, whether or not you want to believe it is.

00:24:51 <v Brian Okken>And so there are pressures to, you know, put SBOMs on or the software bill of materials to verify all your subcomponents and all that stuff.

00:25:01 <v Brian Okken>Python is helping to make that easier for individual maintainers of projects, which is cool.

00:25:08 <v Brian Okken>But it's still some extra work.

00:25:10 <v Brian Okken>And I don't think it's fair that maintainers are having to do that work.

00:25:15 <v Brian Okken>And they don't benefit from it.

00:25:17 <v Brian Okken>The companies benefit.

00:25:19 <v Brian Okken>And we do need to find a way to get money to vendors better or money to contributors.

00:25:27 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I 100% agree.

00:25:28 <v Brian Okken>I do.

00:25:30 <v Michael Kennedy>But yeah.

00:25:31 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't have a great direct, like force them to do it type of answer.

00:25:35 <v Michael Kennedy>But yeah.

00:25:36 <v Michael Kennedy>Hopefully many of them will see like, hey, we benefit from this thing.

00:25:39 <v Michael Kennedy>If we were a major sponsor of this project, <v Michael Kennedy>we could have the ear of the maintainer team

00:25:46 <v Michael Kennedy>to get the thing that we really want.

00:25:47 <v Michael Kennedy>I think that's a possibility.

00:25:50 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, there might also be some like maintenance agreements sort of stuff.

00:25:55 <v Brian Okken>It's definitely open source, <v Brian Okken>but also whoever the main maintainer is,

00:26:02 <v Brian Okken>is for a small fee promising to look at your defect reports

00:26:08 <v Brian Okken>or things like that.

00:26:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, there's this whole productized consulting sort of thing

00:26:13 <v Michael Kennedy>I think would be pretty good, <v Michael Kennedy>where it's like you're going to pay,

00:26:15 <v Michael Kennedy>basically I'm going to pay you a retainer <v Michael Kennedy>and you have a certain amount of credits you can redeem

00:26:20 <v Michael Kennedy>that expire at the end of the month <v Michael Kennedy>for me to potentially come and do exactly like what you're suggesting.

00:26:24 <v Michael Kennedy>And if you don't use it, that's fine.

00:26:25 <v Michael Kennedy>but I'm here at the drop of a hat if you need me, sort of.

00:26:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:26:30 <v Michael Kennedy>You pay me $5,000 a month and I may or may not have to work for you that month,

00:26:33 <v Michael Kennedy>but you know what, that'd be good.

00:26:35 <v Brian Okken>But at the very least, or even having lower ones so more people do it

00:26:38 <v Brian Okken>and to make sure that things are actually stayed maintained

00:26:43 <v Brian Okken>because there's a lot of stuff that's just done <v Brian Okken>and you can't tell whether or not it's really maintained.

00:26:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway.

00:26:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's 100%.

00:26:51 <v Michael Kennedy>100%.

00:26:52 <v Michael Kennedy>In fact, you might even want to go and find just a complete,

00:26:55 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't even put it on GitHub anymore.

00:26:56 <v Michael Kennedy>That's how much I'm changing my mind about open source.

00:26:59 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, so this next topic was going to be about looking for GitHub alternatives.

00:27:09 <v Brian Okken>And so I just left it as the title.

00:27:12 <v Brian Okken>Should I be looking for GitHub alternatives?

00:27:14 <v Brian Okken>And why am I talking about that?

00:27:16 <v Brian Okken>I mean, GitHub's awesome.

00:27:17 <v Brian Okken>Why would you?

00:27:18 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, I think it's great.

00:27:19 <v Brian Okken>I'm still happy with GitHub.

00:27:21 <v Brian Okken>But they sort of fumbled recently.

00:27:23 <v Brian Okken>Did you hear about all this, Michael?

00:27:25 <v Michael Kennedy>yes with the billing oh yes I heard about oh yeah so so what happened what bothers me more even is

00:27:31 <v Michael Kennedy>the the clear lack of craftsmanship and care around the code that runs these it's like you get janky

00:27:38 <v Michael Kennedy>code and we're gonna charge you oh and our bug is also gonna sometimes make it run for hours and

00:27:42 <v Michael Kennedy>then we'll charge you still for that too yeah so there's some pricing changes and the message

00:27:49 <v Brian Okken>pricing changes and they like released it on December 15th and then they they think and then

00:27:53 <v Brian Okken>just recently updated it i can't i don't know when the update was on oh the original announcement

00:27:59 <v Brian Okken>was on the 16th um there's an update to it so they um the gav actions it's way popular than they

00:28:08 <v Brian Okken>thought it would be and actually like just tons of people just switched from and it happened at a

00:28:13 <v Brian Okken>similar a lot of times where people were like travis was imploding so people were trying to

00:28:17 <v Brian Okken>uh leave travis and were like oh you have actions is here let's just use that um that's part of it

00:28:24 <v Brian Okken>But it also benefited GitHub a lot.

00:28:26 <v Brian Okken>A lot of projects started using it more.

00:28:31 <v Brian Okken>However, I get that they have to pay for that compute somehow.

00:28:35 <v Brian Okken>However, they've said, let's see, <v Brian Okken>they're going to have GitHub or hosted runners

00:28:43 <v Brian Okken>are going to reduce their price by 39%.

00:28:46 <v Brian Okken>And I actually didn't realize that they were charging <v Brian Okken>because apparently I don't use it enough to get billed for it.

00:28:52 <v Brian Okken>But in the announcement, they also said that you could see the hosted the non hosted runner.

00:28:58 <v Brian Okken>So like the code that you you've got your own computer set up to run your stuff.

00:29:03 <v Brian Okken>They were going to charge for that, too.

00:29:05 <v Brian Okken>Look, I think that's insane.

00:29:09 <v Brian Okken>It was not a lot.

00:29:09 <v Brian Okken>It was like two tenths of a cent per minute or something like that.

00:29:14 <v Brian Okken>But but that's like it's just sitting there waiting for your GitHub runner, your get runner to finish.

00:29:21 <v Brian Okken>Why would they charge for that?

00:29:23 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, I don't know.

00:29:24 <v Brian Okken>There's been a change.

00:29:25 <v Brian Okken>So we're going to link to the announcement of the pricing change.

00:29:29 <v Brian Okken>I didn't get too much into the details of the pricing change,

00:29:34 <v Brian Okken>but it's kind of weird to charge the same amount for both,

00:29:37 <v Brian Okken>whether or not you're using a hosted runner or your own runner.

00:29:41 <v Brian Okken>That's weird.

00:29:41 <v Brian Okken>So they've actually backed off.

00:29:43 <v Brian Okken>So they're going to postpone the billing for the self-hosted.

00:29:49 <v Brian Okken>They didn't say they're going to not do it, though.

00:29:51 <v Brian Okken>It's just postponed.

00:29:52 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's weird.

00:29:53 <v Michael Kennedy>So I get the argument like, wow, we thought we'd have to buy 100 computers and we're on our 100,000th VM.

00:30:00 <v Michael Kennedy>We've set up this as a little out of control.

00:30:02 <v Michael Kennedy>That doesn't apply to self-hosted.

00:30:04 <v Brian Okken>Well, I mean, the actions are still running, so they're not really charging that much for the actions.

00:30:10 <v Brian Okken>Just the, I mean, all the rest of the stuff is mostly coming for free.

00:30:17 <v Brian Okken>It's just.

00:30:17 <v Michael Kennedy>Right, right.

00:30:18 <v Michael Kennedy>But I mean, if you have a self-hosted GitHub Action runner,

00:30:21 <v Michael Kennedy>they're not paying for the compute to run it <v Michael Kennedy>because you're self-hosting.

00:30:26 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:30:27 <v Brian Okken>Like maybe, like, and if they are having to, <v Brian Okken>I mean, they have to have something that sits around

00:30:32 <v Brian Okken>and like waits for it or something.

00:30:33 <v Brian Okken>I don't know.

00:30:34 <v Brian Okken>But figure out how to do that way cheaper.

00:30:37 <v Brian Okken>It should be like super cheap.

00:30:40 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, because that's like, <v Brian Okken>that's one of the reasons why people have their own runner

00:30:43 <v Brian Okken>is to save on compute.

00:30:45 <v Michael Kennedy>So yeah, that was weird.

00:30:47 <v Brian Okken>So I went ahead and like, you know, why not look at other stuff?

00:30:50 <v Brian Okken>So let's look at some other.

00:30:52 <v Brian Okken>That's the warning thing.

00:30:53 <v Brian Okken>Some other alternatives.

00:30:55 <v Brian Okken>So I found this article.

00:30:56 <v Brian Okken>I just searched for it.

00:30:57 <v Brian Okken>There's four GitHub alternatives that are just as good or better.

00:31:02 <v Brian Okken>And there's some that I hadn't heard of.

00:31:03 <v Brian Okken>So this is kind of fun.

00:31:05 <v Brian Okken>I hadn't heard of Codeberg.

00:31:06 <v Brian Okken>So nonprofit community-led effort that provides Git hosting and other services for free and open source projects.

00:31:14 <v Brian Okken>Okay, so it's not for private projects or something, but there's a lot here.

00:31:19 <v Brian Okken>So maybe something to look into.

00:31:21 <v Brian Okken>But I don't think that GitHub is charging that much for open source either.

00:31:26 <v Brian Okken>But it's fun to look at some of these alternatives.

00:31:28 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, I think Codeberg only lets you have open source.

00:31:32 <v Michael Kennedy>Just only open source.

00:31:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it's like free.

00:31:34 <v Michael Kennedy>You almost got to apply to a join sort of thing.

00:31:39 <v Brian Okken>And then Bitbucket.

00:31:40 <v Brian Okken>I mean, like, I didn't, I guess I forgot it's around.

00:31:44 <v Michael Kennedy>Sorry, Bitbucket.

00:31:45 <v Michael Kennedy>I did too.

00:31:46 <v Michael Kennedy>I use SourceTree all the time, which was, I believe, made sort of as the front end of Bitbucket if you want to desktop thing.

00:31:53 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:31:54 <v Michael Kennedy>And still, I forgot Bitbucket exists.

00:31:57 <v Brian Okken>So, Bitbucket, yeah, it's not, oldest established competitor of GitHub.

00:32:03 <v Brian Okken>I think it predates GitHub.

00:32:05 <v Brian Okken>I'm not sure.

00:32:06 <v Brian Okken>But it launched around the same time in 2008.

00:32:09 <v Brian Okken>it's still maintained it's still there so you can um and the interface is a lot better than it was

00:32:14 <v Brian Okken>way back in the 2008 9 10 time frame when i was using it but uh bit bucket git lab and actually

00:32:21 <v Brian Okken>git lab's a solid alternative i use uh git lab at work and um the thing that yeah i like git lab

00:32:28 <v Brian Okken>uh definitely a an option to look into it uh git ea g g-i-t-e-a haven't heard of this before but

00:32:37 <v Brian Okken>it's around as well and then while i was looking around for this i also came up came around some

00:32:42 <v Brian Okken>some comments on socials about tangled it's an alpha it's a new it's a new thing it came out

00:32:48 <v Brian Okken>this year i think um a uh tightly knit social coding so they're really trying to um and they're

00:32:57 <v Brian Okken>launching as a lightweight lightweight github repo get repo hosting but the way they're

00:33:04 <v Brian Okken>dealing with it, I think, is the pipelines and the runs are running. I don't know if they have

00:33:09 <v Brian Okken>runners in the cloud. I think it looks like they're mainly trying to get you to run your own runners.

00:33:15 <v Brian Okken>So it's interesting. I could be wrong, but there are definitely some different options around there

00:33:21 <v Brian Okken>if you really do want to get off GitHub. I like GitLab and GitHub mostly.

00:33:28 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm always tempted to do some self-hosted thing. I love the idea of it so much.

00:33:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:33:34 <v Michael Kennedy>So I have to talk myself off the ledge periodically.

00:33:37 <v Michael Kennedy>And if you're doing something just for you, <v Michael Kennedy>I think it's cool to pick something based on features, right?

00:33:43 <v Michael Kennedy>Or some kind of philosophy of the company.

00:33:46 <v Michael Kennedy>Like this one is only open source, or this one is super privacy,

00:33:48 <v Michael Kennedy>or this one is European-based or whatever, right?

00:33:52 <v Michael Kennedy>However, if you're doing open source <v Michael Kennedy>and you actually want it to be used by people,

00:33:57 <v Michael Kennedy>there's no other option than GitHub.

00:33:59 <v Brian Okken>Well, okay.

00:34:00 <v Brian Okken>I think if you really want people to interact with it, <v Brian Okken>GitHub, and contribute.

00:34:07 <v Brian Okken>I mean, contributors, yes, exactly.

00:34:09 <v Brian Okken>And file defects and all that sort of stuff, GitHub.

00:34:14 <v Brian Okken>But I've seen a lot of projects that a lot of the community

00:34:17 <v Brian Okken>is just complaining, either complaining <v Brian Okken>or asking for features that aren't even part of it.

00:34:24 <v Brian Okken>So you're doing, basically, if you don't want interact, <v Brian Okken>if you want people to use it, it needs to be on PyPI for Python.

00:34:32 <v Brian Okken>But if you really don't want people to file defects and contribute junk,

00:34:39 <v Brian Okken>yeah, I think switching to GitLab or something like that totally makes sense.

00:34:42 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:34:43 <v Michael Kennedy>I mean, it's like saying, I don't like that Twitter went away,

00:34:45 <v Michael Kennedy>so I'm going to set up my own private social media <v Michael Kennedy>and then invite my friends to join.

00:34:50 <v Michael Kennedy>They may or may, they probably are not going to come.

00:34:52 <v Michael Kennedy>If they do, they're probably going to not visit it after three days.

00:34:55 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:34:55 <v Michael Kennedy>It's like, even though these things are awesome in GitHub

00:34:58 <v Michael Kennedy>as being not ideal in some ways.

00:35:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:35:01 <v Michael Kennedy>The truth of social stuff <v Michael Kennedy>is you got to be where the people are.

00:35:04 <v Michael Kennedy>Otherwise, it's tough to work with.

00:35:05 <v Michael Kennedy>So anyway, that's mostly a note to myself in the future.

00:35:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, okay.

00:35:11 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:35:12 <v Michael Kennedy>How are we feeling about extras?

00:35:13 <v Michael Kennedy>I have a couple extras, but why don't you go?

00:35:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:35:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's talk about PyCharm for a second.

00:35:19 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'm a big fan of Ruff.

00:35:21 <v Michael Kennedy>No doubt about that.

00:35:22 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm also a fan of Pyrefly, <v Michael Kennedy>which I've been using a lot lately,

00:35:26 <v Michael Kennedy>And ty, which I believe ty just went into beta.

00:35:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Shouldn't that be one of our items?

00:35:30 <v Michael Kennedy>I believe it should be.

00:35:31 <v Michael Kennedy>It probably should.

00:35:33 <v Michael Kennedy>But ty, the one from Astral, that is sort of the high-performance companion or frenemy of Pyrefly,

00:35:40 <v Michael Kennedy>they both are now in beta mode.

00:35:44 <v Michael Kennedy>And with the latest release of PyCharm, it expands its LSP support

00:35:49 <v Michael Kennedy>so that it has native integration for Ruff, ty, and Pyrefly plus Pyrite.

00:35:55 <v Michael Kennedy>And this news comes to us from Daniel Muldmer, if I haven't said so.

00:35:57 <v Michael Kennedy>So thanks, Dean, for sending that in.

00:35:59 <v Michael Kennedy>And there's actually a whole link, a page which I'll link to about the LSP support and how you turn that on if you want.

00:36:06 <v Michael Kennedy>So you can have, like, native Ruff integration and so on.

00:36:09 <v Michael Kennedy>So anyway, shout out.

00:36:11 <v Michael Kennedy>Shout out to that.

00:36:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Also, RUF's page has a setup for how to do it in reverse.

00:36:15 <v Brian Okken>The LSP being for language servers always throws me.

00:36:19 <v Brian Okken>So I'm like, PyCharm now supports LISP, but that's weird.

00:36:22 <v Michael Kennedy>I know.

00:36:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Also, it feels redundant, an LSP server.

00:36:28 <v Michael Kennedy>It's already a language server.

00:36:29 <v Michael Kennedy>I guess a language server, protocol server.

00:36:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Shouldn't it just be a language server?

00:36:33 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:36:33 <v Michael Kennedy>It's like saying it's an HTTP website or something.

00:36:38 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:36:39 <v Michael Kennedy>It's HTTP protocol.

00:36:41 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:36:42 <v Michael Kennedy>Right.

00:36:42 <v Michael Kennedy>It's an HTTP protocol website that you access with your browser now.

00:36:45 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:36:45 <v Michael Kennedy>Last thing.

00:36:46 <v Michael Kennedy>I didn't save the link to this, but I thought this was a fun...

00:36:52 <v Michael Kennedy>I saw this on xTwitter, and it's just like a little sign off,

00:36:55 <v Michael Kennedy>like sort of wishing you well or like, <v Michael Kennedy>take care till next time I see you.

00:36:59 <v Michael Kennedy>But here's the developer version.

00:37:01 <v Michael Kennedy>May your bug tracker be forever empty.

00:37:03 <v Brian Okken>Oh, nice.

00:37:03 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, very nice.

00:37:04 <v Michael Kennedy>It's a little bit of a play on Hunger Games, I believe.

00:37:07 <v Michael Kennedy>May the odds be forever in your favor.

00:37:08 <v Michael Kennedy>You know, that sort of thing.

00:37:09 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, and like I was saying, if you really <v Brian Okken>want your bug tracker to be empty, move it away from GitHub.

00:37:15 <v Brian Okken>Yep.

00:37:17 <v Brian Okken>A couple of things, just a reminder to people, <v Brian Okken>I am taking this the rest of December off from updates to the lean TDD book,

00:37:25 <v Brian Okken>but, <v Brian Okken>but this is an attempt to explain to people how to actually get productivity

00:37:30 <v Brian Okken>gains from test driven development.

00:37:32 <v Brian Okken>But I'll pick it up in January.

00:37:34 <v Brian Okken>I'm hoping actually to finish the, <v Brian Okken>finish the entire first draft in January.

00:37:37 <v Brian Okken>That's the goal.

00:37:37 <v Brian Okken>That's a, <v Brian Okken>that's an aggressive goal, <v Brian Okken>but,

00:37:40 <v Brian Okken>but I have all the stuff I want to do.

00:37:41 <v Brian Okken>So we'll see.

00:37:43 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:37:44 <v Brian Okken>Finally, <v Brian Okken>pie, <v Brian Okken>the pie test course.

00:37:46 <v Brian Okken>I just had somebody asked me this morning, <v Brian Okken>sent me an email and said, hey, I bought the book.

00:37:51 <v Brian Okken>Love the Python Testament by this book.

00:37:54 <v Brian Okken>And I'd like the course.

00:37:56 <v Brian Okken>Can I get a discount?

00:37:57 <v Brian Okken>And I just love people that just ask.

00:37:59 <v Brian Okken>So I gave him a discount, of course, <v Brian Okken>but also so you can always email and ask.

00:38:04 <v Brian Okken>But I also just decided to throw a 50% off sale <v Brian Okken>for the Christmas time.

00:38:10 <v Brian Okken>So last minute Christmas shopping for yourself.

00:38:13 <v Brian Okken>I'll put this in the show notes, <v Brian Okken>But if you use the code Xmas, X-M-A-S 2025,

00:38:19 <v Brian Okken>I'll give you 50% off.

00:38:21 <v Michael Kennedy>Very, very nice.

00:38:22 <v Michael Kennedy>And I'm looking forward to a more efficient <v Michael Kennedy>and error-free 2026 Christmas

00:38:28 <v Michael Kennedy>after Rudolph and team use your discount, <v Michael Kennedy>learn test-driven better.

00:38:33 <v Michael Kennedy>And then, you know, next year round, <v Michael Kennedy>their deliveries will be more error-free.

00:38:36 <v Michael Kennedy>You're doing a service for all the kids.

00:38:39 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:38:41 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:38:41 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:38:42 <v Michael Kennedy>We got a couple of funny things.

00:38:43 <v Michael Kennedy>We do.

00:38:44 <v Michael Kennedy>One is mine, one is yours.

00:38:46 <v Michael Kennedy>So what if you have errors in your code?

00:38:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, that's what structured error handling is for.

00:38:53 <v Michael Kennedy>Exceptions, you know, try, catch, try, accept, depending on your language.

00:38:57 <v Michael Kennedy>But what do you do when the error happens, Brian?

00:38:59 <v Michael Kennedy>What do you do when the error happens?

00:39:01 <v Michael Kennedy>One possibility is to log it.

00:39:02 <v Michael Kennedy>You've got to already have your login set up.

00:39:04 <v Michael Kennedy>So, you know, there's a few steps.

00:39:05 <v Michael Kennedy>I guess you could print it.

00:39:06 <v Michael Kennedy>That's a bit of a help.

00:39:07 <v Michael Kennedy>Maybe you just have a beep, play the beep sound when an exception happens.

00:39:11 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:39:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, this person decided to write a simple two-liner.

00:39:17 <v Michael Kennedy>This is in JavaScript in the example, but it could be just as well.

00:39:20 <v Michael Kennedy>It says, if I catch an exception, I'm going to create a string that's

00:39:25 <v Michael Kennedy>HTTP colon slash slash stackoverflow.com slash search question mark Q equals.

00:39:30 <v Michael Kennedy>And you put the exception message in the end and then you open a browser to that.

00:39:34 <v Brian Okken>Wow.

00:39:35 <v Michael Kennedy>Problem solved.

00:39:36 <v Michael Kennedy>Old school.

00:39:37 <v Michael Kennedy>That's old school.

00:39:37 <v Michael Kennedy>I think the modern version is to just call an open AI API.

00:39:41 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, just ask your agent to run it, catch all exceptions, and fix it for you with PRs.

00:39:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:39:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, just feel free to go ahead and auto-commit and publish it at production.

00:39:52 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't need to review it.

00:39:53 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, but be sure to label it with the prompt for that we discussed last week.

00:39:58 <v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:40:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's see.

00:40:01 <v Michael Kennedy>Any good comments?

00:40:02 <v Michael Kennedy>Is this real?

00:40:02 <v Michael Kennedy>This is hilarious, whether or not.

00:40:04 <v Michael Kennedy>This is perfectly fine for local prod as well, as far as I'm concerned, production as in live.

00:40:10 <v Michael Kennedy>Cutting out the middle, man.

00:40:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Literally saves a precious three seconds.

00:40:14 <v Michael Kennedy>3.531, actually.

00:40:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, and someone literally did write a ChatGPT alternative in the comments.

00:40:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Nice.

00:40:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, there you go.

00:40:25 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, perfect.

00:40:26 <v Michael Kennedy>So it even came up with a prompt for you.

00:40:28 <v Michael Kennedy>Following error, it's occurred in my JavaScript application.

00:40:30 <v Michael Kennedy>Please write code that resolves this issue.

00:40:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Respond only with code.

00:40:33 <v Michael Kennedy>Here's the exception.

00:40:35 <v Michael Kennedy>Oh, yeah.

00:40:36 <v Michael Kennedy>Pretty good.

00:40:37 <v Michael Kennedy>Pretty good stuff.

00:40:37 <v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:40:38 <v Michael Kennedy>This one's for you.

00:40:39 <v Michael Kennedy>You got it.

00:40:40 <v Brian Okken>Okay.

00:40:40 <v Brian Okken>So last week, what did we title our podcast episode?

00:40:44 <v Brian Okken>Something like LinkedIn something?

00:40:47 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, somebody responded with, oh, LinkedIn Cringe.

00:40:53 <v Brian Okken>Somebody called Archtoad said, LinkedIn Cringe made me think of this.

00:40:59 <v Brian Okken>It's AI blockchain kombucha startup.

00:41:02 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, this comes from Archtoad referring to a post by Tim Kellogg

00:41:10 <v Brian Okken>using nano banana prompt, create a super annoying LinkedIn profile, which is amazing.

00:41:17 <v Brian Okken>So the profile is great.

00:41:19 <v Brian Okken>The with a with a like a hero image with somebody giving a speech and the on the screen is disrupt

00:41:26 <v Brian Okken>or die, which is great, great screen capture.

00:41:30 <v Brian Okken>But the let's see, let's read his profile.

00:41:33 <v Brian Okken>He's a visionary, 10X growth ninja, chief evangelist at stealth mode, at a stealth mode AI blockchain kombucha startup.

00:41:43 <v Brian Okken>That's awesome.

00:41:45 <v Brian Okken>Helping Fortune 500 CEOs maximize human synergy means nothing.

00:41:51 <v Brian Okken>A TEDx speaker applicant.

00:41:56 <v Brian Okken>Not even TED, just like a TEDx.

00:41:58 <v Brian Okken>Yeah, sure, TEDx, which is like the original.

00:42:01 <v Brian Okken>I applied to speak.

00:42:03 <v Brian Okken>I didn't get it, but I applied.

00:42:06 <v Brian Okken>Forbes 30 Under 30 nominee.

00:42:08 <v Brian Okken>Oh, my gosh.

00:42:09 <v Brian Okken>A dog dad, coffee addict.

00:42:12 <v Brian Okken>Why are you still reading this?

00:42:13 <v Brian Okken>Let's connect.

00:42:17 <v Brian Okken>About Bryden just doesn't just work.

00:42:19 <v Brian Okken>Bryden shifts paradigms.

00:42:22 <v Brian Okken>That's awesome.

00:42:24 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, really good things I'd like to see in a LinkedIn profile.

00:42:30 <v Michael Kennedy>This is pretty good.

00:42:31 <v Michael Kennedy>I didn't realize that this originally came from Nana Banana.

00:42:34 <v Michael Kennedy>I feel like the challenge is on for the follow-ups.

00:42:39 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:42:40 <v Michael Kennedy>Pretty amazing.

00:42:40 <v Michael Kennedy>Pretty amazing.

00:42:43 <v Brian Okken>Anyway, it's been an amazing run for us and an amazing 2025, I think.

00:42:49 <v Brian Okken>Things are going good.

00:42:50 <v Brian Okken>And, I mean, aside from, like, you know, our entire country imploding.

00:42:55 <v Brian Okken>But, you know, other than that, things have been going pretty good for you and I.

00:42:58 <v Michael Kennedy>So it's been a, you know, the backhanded compliment curses, may you live in interesting

00:43:04 <v Michael Kennedy>times while things are interesting.

00:43:06 <v Michael Kennedy>Definitely interesting.

00:43:07 <v Michael Kennedy>I do want to say though, thank you to everyone for listening this year, all the years and

00:43:11 <v Michael Kennedy>here's to 2026.

00:43:13 <v Brian Okken>Yeah.

00:43:14 <v Brian Okken>happy holidays and hope everybody has a good new year.

00:43:17 <v Brian Okken>Yep.

00:43:17 <v Brian Okken>Bye.

00:43:17 <v Brian Okken>Bye.

00:43:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Thanks, Brian.
