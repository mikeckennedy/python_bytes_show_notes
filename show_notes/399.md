**Michael #1:** [Why I Still Use Python Virtual Environments in Docker](https://hynek.me/articles/docker-virtualenv/)

- by Hynek Schlawack
- I was going to cover [Production-ready Docker Containers with uv](https://hynek.me/articles/docker-uv/) but decided to take this diversion instead.
- Spend a lot of time thinking about the secondary effects of what you do.
- venvs are well known and well documented. Let’s use them.

**Brian #2:** [**Python Developer Survey Results**](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2023/)

- “… official Python Developers Survey, conducted as a collaborative effort between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains.”
- Python w/ Rust rising, but still only 7%
- ““The drop in HTML/CSS/JS might show that data science is increasing its share of Python.” - Paul Everitt
- 37% contribute to open source. Awesome.
- Favorite Resources: Podcasts
  - Lots of familiar faces there. Awesome. 
    - Perhaps I shouldn’t have decided to move “Python Test” back to [Test & Code](https://testandcode.com)
- Usage
  - “Data analysis” down, but I think that’s because “data engineering” is added.
  - Data, Web dev, ML, devops, academic, 
  - Testing is down ![disappointed face](https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/1f61e.png?version=8.0.0) 23%
- Python Versions
  - Still some 2 out there
  - Most folks on 3.10-3.12
- Install from: mostly python.org
- Frameworks
  - web: Flask, Django, Requests, FastAPI …
  - testing: pytest, unittest, mock, doctest, tox, hypothesis, nose (2% might be the Python 2 people)
- Data science
  - 77% use pandas, 72% NumPy
- OS: Windows still at 55% 
- Packaging: 
  - venv up to 55%
  - I imaging uv will be on the list next year
  - requirements.txt 63%, pyproject.toml 32%
- virtual env in containers? 47% say no

**Michael #3:** [Anaconda Code add-in for Microsoft Excel](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/introducing-anaconda-code-add-in-for-microsoft-excel)

- Run their Python-powered projects in Excel locally with the Anaconda Code add-in
- Powered by PyScript, an Anaconda supported open source project that runs Python locally without install and setup
- Features
  - Cells Run Independently
  - Range to Multiple Types
  - init.py file is static and cannot be edited, with Anaconda Code, users have the ability to access and edit imports and definitions, allowing you to write top-level functions and classes and reuse them wherever you need. 
  - A Customizable Environment 

**Brian #4:** [**Disabling Scheduled Dependency Updates**](https://davidism.com/disabling-scheduled-dependency-updates/)

- David Lord
- Interesting discussion of as they happen or batching of upsates to dependencies
- dependencies come in
  - requirements files
  - GH Actions in CI workflows
  - pre-commit hooks
- David was seeing 60 PRs per month when set up on monthly updates (3 ecosystems * 20 projects)
- new tool for updating GH actions: [gha-update](https://gha-update.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), allows for local updating of GH dependencies
- New process
  - Run pip-compile, gha-update, and pre-commit locally.
  - Update a project’s dependencies when actively working on the project, not just whenever a dependency updates.
  - Note that this works fine for dev dependencies, less so for security updates from run time dependencies. But for libraries, runtime dependencies are usually not pinned.
