**Brian #1:**  [PEP 772 – Packaging governance process](https://peps.python.org/pep-0772/) 

- draft, created 21-Jan, by Barry Warsaw, Deb Nicholson, Pradyun Gedam
- “As Python packaging has matured, several interrelated problems with the current way of managing the technical development, decision making and processes have become apparent.”
- “This PEP proposes a Python Packaging Council with broad authority over packaging standards, tools, and implementations. Like the Python Steering Council, the Packaging Council seeks to exercise this authority as rarely as possible; instead, they use this power to establish standard processes.”
- PEP discusses
  - PyPA, Packaging-WG, Interoperability Standards, Python Steering Council, and Expectations of an elected Packaging Council
  - A specification with
    - Composition: 5 people
    - Mandate, Responsibilities, Delegations, Process, Terms, etc.

**Michael #2:** [Official Django MongoDB Backend](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-django-backend-now-available-public-preview?utm_source=www.pythonweekly.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=python-weekly-issue-687-february-13-2025&_bhlid=ac970bf5150af48b53b11f639dd520db04c9a2aa) Now Available in Public Preview

- Over the last few years, Django developers have increasingly used MongoDB, presenting an opportunity for an official MongoDB-built Python package to make integrating both technologies as painless as possible.
- Features
  - **The ability to use Django models with confidence**. Developers can use Django [models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/models/) to represent MongoDB documents, with support for Django forms, validations, and authentication.
  - **Django admin support**. The package allows users to fire up the Django admin page as they normally would, with full support for [migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/migrations/#module-django.db.migrations) and database schema history.
  - **Native connecting from settings.py**. Just as with any other database provider, developers can customize the database engine in settings.py to get MongoDB up and running.
  - **MongoDB-specific querying optimizations**. Field lookups have been replaced with aggregation calls (aggregation stages and aggregate operators), JOIN operations are represented through $lookup, and it’s possible to build indexes right from Python.
  - **Limited advanced functionality**. While still in development, the package already has support for time series, projections, and XOR operations.
  - **Aggregation pipeline support**. Raw querying allows aggregation pipeline operators. Since aggregation is a superset of what traditional MongoDB Query API methods provide, it gives developers more functionality.

**Brian #3:** [**Developer Philosophy**](https://qntm.org/devphilo)

- by qntm
- Intended as “advice for junior developers about personal dev philosophy”, I think these are just great tips to keep in mind.
- The items
  - Avoid, at all costs, arriving at a scenario where the ground-up rewrite starts to look attractive
    - This is less about “don’t do rewrites”, but about noticing the warning signs ahead of time.
  - Aim to be 90% done in 50% of the available time
    - Great quote: “The first 90% of the job takes 90% of the time. The last 10% of the job takes the other 90% of the time.”
  - Automate good practices
  - Think about pathological data
    - “Nobody cares about the golden path. Edge cases are our *entire job*.”
    - Brian’s note: But also think about the happy path. Documenting and testing what you think of as the happy path is a testing start and helps others understand your idea of how things are supposed to work.
  - There’s usually a simpler way to write it
  - Write code to be testable
  - It is insufficient for code to be provably correct; it should be obviously, visibly, trivially correct
    - Brian’s note: Even if it’s obviously, visibly, trivially correct, it will still break. So test it anyway.

**Michael #4:** [Python 3.13.2](https://docs.python.org/release/3.13.2/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-13-2) released

- Python 3.13’s second maintenance release. 
- About 250 changes went into this update
- Also Python 3.12.9, Python 3.12’s ninth maintenance release already. Just 180 changes for 3.12, but it’s still worth upgrading.
- For us, it’s simply rebuilding our Docker base (i.e. —no-cache) with these lines:

```
RUN curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache uv venv --python 3.13 /venv
```

**Extras** 

Brian:

- Still thinking about pytest plugins a lot.
- The [top pytest plugin list](https://pythontest.com/top-pytest-plugins/)
  - Has been updated for Feb
  - Is starting to include things without “pytest” in the name, like Hypothesis and Syrupy. 
    - Eventually I’ll have to add “looking at trove classifiers” as part of the search, but for now, let me know if you’re favorite is missing.
  - Includes T&C podcast episode links if I’ve covered it on the show. 
    - There’s 2 so far

Michael:

- There's [a new release of PyScript](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/releases/tag/2025.2.1) out. All the details are here: Highlight is new PyGame-CE support. Go play!
- [PEP 2026 – Calendar versioning for Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-2026/) rejected. :(
- [PEP 759 – External Wheel Hosting](https://peps.python.org/pep-0759/) withdrawn
