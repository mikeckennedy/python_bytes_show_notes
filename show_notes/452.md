**Michael #2: [Free-threaded Python Library Compatibility Checker](https://ft-checker.com)**

- by [Donghee Na](https://github.com/corona10)
- App checks compatibility of top PyPI libraries with CPython 3.13t and 3.14t, helping developers understand how the Python ecosystem adapts to upcoming Python versions.
- It’s still pretty red, let’s get in the game everyone!

**Michael #3: [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5)**

- Top programming model (even above Opus 4.1)
- Shows large improvements in reducing concerning behaviors like sycophancy, deception, power-seeking, and the tendency to encourage delusional thinking
- Anthropic is releasing the Claude Agent SDK, the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, making it available for developers to build their own agents, along with major upgrades including checkpoints, a VS Code extension, and new context editing features
- And Claude Sonnet 4.5 is available in [PyCharm too](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/09/introducing-claude-agent-in-jetbrains-ides/?utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=general&utm_content=newsletter&map=2&mkt_tok=NDI2LVFWRC0xMTQAAAGdONnRabyMjVqZtzoP7gHexU8ch5afa-LRr8ve6qJs4H77qyz2tc6urxCZzTisSMxMDk1b7lvoTH8thHAh4_VCms-0_cbvDAen9_dSRNXu3axlSpR2).

**Brian #4: [Python 3.15 will get Explicit lazy imports](https://pep-previews--4622.org.readthedocs.build/pep-0810/)**

- [Discussion](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-810-explicit-lazy-imports/104131) on [discuss.python.org](http://discuss.python.org)
- This PEP introduces syntax for lazy imports as an explicit language feature:

```python
lazy import json
lazy from json import dumps
```

- BTW, lazy loading in fixtures is a super easy way to speed up test startup times.
