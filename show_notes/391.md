**Michael #1:** [**Vendorize packages from PyPI**](https://github.com/mwilliamson/python-vendorize)

- Allows pure-Python dependencies to be vendorized: that is, the Python source of the dependency is copied into your own package.
- Best used for small, pure-Python dependencies

**Brian #2:** [**A Guide to Python's Weak References Using weakref Module**](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/112)

- Martin Heinz
- Very cool discussion of weakref
- Quick garbage collection intro, and how references and weak references are used.
- Using weak references to build data structures.
  - Example of two kinds of trees
- Implementing the Observer pattern
- How logging and OrderedDict use weak references

 **Michael #3:**  [**Making Time Speak**](https://github.com/Proteusiq/saa)

- by Prayson, a former guest and friend of the show
- Translating time into human-friendly spoken expressions
- Example: clock("11:15") # 'quarter past eleven' 
- Features
  - Convert time into spoken expressions in various languages.
  - Easy-to-use API with a simple and intuitive design.
  - Pure Python implementation with no external dependencies.
  - Extensible architecture for adding support for additional languages using the plugin design pattern.

**Brian #4:** [**How Should You Test Your Machine Learning Project? A Beginner’s Guide**](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-should-you-test-your-machine-learning-project-a-beginners-guide-2e22da5a9bfc)

- François Porcher
- Using pytest and pytest-cov for testing machine learning projects
- Lots of pieces can and should be tested just as normal functions.
  - Example of testing a clean_text(text: str) -> str function
- Test larger chunks with canned input and expected output.
  - Example test_tokenize_text()
- Using fixtures for larger reusable components in testing
  - Example fixture: bert_tokenizer() with pretrained data
- Checking coverage
