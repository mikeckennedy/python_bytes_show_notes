**Brian #1:** [**mdformat**](https://github.com/hukkin/mdformat)

- Suggested by Matthias Schöttle
- [Last episode ](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/425/if-you-were-a-klingon-programmer)Michael covered blacken-docs, and I mentioned it’d be nice to have an autoformatter for text markdown.
- Matthias delivered with suggesting mdformat
- “Mdformat is an opinionated Markdown formatter that can be used to enforce a consistent style in Markdown files.”
- A python project that can be run on the command line.
- Uses a [style guide](https://mdformat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/style.html) I mostly agree with.
  - I’m not a huge fan of numbered list items all being “1.”, but that can be turned off with --number, so I’m happy.
  - Converts underlined headings to #, ##, etc. headings.
  - Lots of other sane conventions.
  - The numbering thing is also sane, I just think it also makes the raw markdown hard to read.
- Has a [plugin system to format code blocks](https://mdformat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/plugins.html)

**Michael #2:** [pre-commit-uv](https://github.com/tox-dev/pre-commit-uv)

- via Ben Falk
- Use uv to create virtual environments and install packages for pre-commit.

**Brian #3:** **PEP 758 and 781**

- [PEP 758 – Allow except and except* expressions without parentheses](https://peps.python.org/pep-0758/)
  - accepted
- [PEP 781 – Make TYPE_CHECKING a built-in constant](https://peps.python.org/pep-0781/)
  - draft status
- Also,[ PEP Index by Category ](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000/#index-by-category)kinda rocks

**Michael #4:** [Serie](https://github.com/lusingander/serie): rich git commit graph in your terminal, like magic ![books](https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/1f4da.png?version=8.0.0)

- While some users prefer to use Git via CLI, they often rely on a GUI or feature-rich TUI to view commit logs. 
- Others may find git log --graph sufficient.
- **Goals**
  - Provide a rich git log --graph experience in the terminal.
  - Offer commit graph-centric browsing of Git repositories.
