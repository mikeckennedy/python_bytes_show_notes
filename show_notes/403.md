**Michael #1:** [uv under discussion on Mastodon](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/8/uv-under-discussion-on-mastodon/)

- It’s interesting that uv is slightly controversial
- [Russell](https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742/113093889194737339):

- As enthusiastic as I am about the direction uv is going, I *haven't* adopted them anywhere - because I want very much to understand Astral’s intended business model before I hook my wagon to their tools.

- [Hynek](https://mastodon.social/@hynek/113094437303343866):

- As much as I hate VC, [...] FOSS projects flame out all the time too. … To me uv looks like a genius sting to trick VCs into paying to fix packaging. We’ll be better off either way.

- [Glyph](https://mastodon.social/@glyph/113094489295782200):

- Rust is more expensive and difficult to maintain, not to mention "non-native" to the average customer here.  … it can burn out *all* the other projects in the ecosystem simultaneously, creating a risk of monoculture

- [Hynek on Rust](https://mastodon.social/@hynek/113094547139925962):

- I don’t think y’all quite grok what uv makes so special due to your seniority. The speed is really cool, but the reason Rust is elemental is that it’s one compiled blob that can be used to bootstrap and maintain a Python development.

- [Christopher Neugebauer](https://social.coop/@chrisjrn/113094511860843571):

- Just dropping in here to say that corporate capture of the Python ecosystem is the #1 keeps-me-up-at-night subject in my community work, so I watch Astral with interest, even if I'm not yet too worried.

- [Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/8/21/harvest-season/)

- What uv is doing, even in the worst possible future this is a very forkable and maintainable thing.

- Finally, see the comment at the end by Charlie Marsh

**Brian #2:** [erdantic: Entity Relationship Diagrams](https://github.com/drivendataorg/erdantic)

- “erdantic is a simple tool for drawing entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) for Python data model classes. Diagrams are rendered using the venerable Graphviz library.”
- Supported data modeling frameworks are:
  - Pydantic V2
  - Pydantic V1 legacy
  - attrs
  - dataclasses 

**Michael #3:** **Extra, Extra, Extra**

- Added [Python Bytes Search as a custom search engine](https://search.pythonbytes.fm/api/browser).
- [Along came passkeys. A cool idea that quickly turned evil.](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/passkey-great-but-careful-of-the-lock-in/)
- Follow up from post and my conversation last week: [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) (via [Pablo](https://x.com/mkennedy/status/1838974519463334163))
- [uv publish](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.4.16)
- Trying the [tabs on bottom lifestyle](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/tabs/tab-display/) inspired by Arc
- Adding [Python Bytes](https://search.pythonbytes.fm/api/browser) (and Talk Python) [as custom search engines](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/you-should-use-custom-search-engines-way-more/).
- [PyCon 2025 dates](https://www.python.org/events/python-events/1507/): From 14 May through 22 May, 2025

**Brian #4:** Django Extra, Extra, Extra

- [Django Project Ideas](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/09/django-project-ideas/)
  - Evgenia Verbina
  - Project ideas with list of tech stack stuff you’ll learn and/or work on with the project
  - Ex: Recipe organizer
    - tech stack: Django templates, Django ORM, Optional JavaScript
    - “Familiarize yourself with Django’s ORM (object-relational mapper) and database support by building an app to keep track of your favorite recipes. Add a web-based frontend with options to filter recipes by category, ingredients, and user ratings so you can easily browse for inspiration.”
- [DjangoTV](https://djangotv.com)
  - Jeff Triplett
  - Django conference videos and tutorials.
- [Django Commons](https://github.com/django-commons)
  - Heard about from Lacey Henschel
  - “Django Commons is an organization dedicated to supporting the community's efforts to maintain packages. It seeks to improve the maintenance experience for all contributors; reducing the barrier to entry for new contributors and reducing overhead for existing maintainers.”
- [Django 5 has simplified templates for better form field rendering](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/releases/5.0/#simplified-templates-for-form-field-rendering)
- But if you want a completely different take on forms, maybe try [iommi forms](https://docs.iommi.rocks/en/latest/forms.html)
  - They wrote about it on [Why we wrote a new form library for Django](https://kodare.net/2024/09/11/why-we-wrote-a-new-form-library-for-django.html)
- [Djade: a Django template formatter](https://adamj.eu/tech/2024/09/26/django-introducing-djade/)
  - Adam Johnson
  - Like black or ruff, but for Django templates.
