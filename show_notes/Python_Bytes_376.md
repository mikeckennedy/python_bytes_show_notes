- Jeff Triplett
- ‚ÄúIn theory, this file helps control what search engines and AI scrapers are allowed to visit, but I need more confidence in its effectiveness in the post-AI apocalyptic world.‚Äù

- Podcast questions:
    - Should content creators block AI from our work?
    - Should‚Äôt we set up a standard way to do this?
    - I still haven‚Äôt found a way to block GitHub repositories. 
        - Is there a way?
        - Licensing is one thing (not easy), but I don‚Äôt think any bots respect any protocol for repos.

**Michael #2:** [**niquests**](https://github.com/jawah/niquests)

- Requests but with HTTP/3, HTTP/2, Multiplexed Connections, System CAs, Certificate Revocation, DNS over HTTPS / TLS / QUIC or UDP, Async, DNSSEC, and (much) pain removed!
- **Niquests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library. It is a drop-in replacement for **Requests**, which is under feature freeze.

**Brian #3:**  [**Every dunder method in Python**](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/every-dunder-method/)

- Trey Hunner
- Sure, there‚Äôs `__repr__()`, `__str__()`, and `__init__()`, but how about dunder methods for:
    - Equality and hashability
    - Orderability
    - Type conversions and formatting
    - Context managers
    - Containers and collections
    - Callability
    - Arithmetic operators
    - ‚Ä¶ and so much more ‚Ä¶ even a cheat sheet.
    

**Michael #4:** [**Lockbox**](https://github.com/mkjt2/lockbox)

- Lockbox is a forward proxy for making third party API calls.
- Why? Automation or workflow platforms like Zapier and IFTTT allow "webhook" actions for interacting with third party APIs.
- They require you to provide your third party API keys so they can act on your behalf. You are trusting them to keep your API keys safe, and that they do not misuse them.
- How Lockbox helps: When a workflow platform needs to make a third party API call on your behalf, it makes a Lockbox API call instead. Lockbox makes the call to the third party API, and returns the result to the workflow platform.
