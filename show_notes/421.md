**Michael #1:** [httpdbg](https://github.com/cle-b/httpdbg)

- A tool for Python developers to easily debug the HTTP(S) client requests in a Python program.
- To use it, execute your program using the pyhttpdbg command instead of python and that's it. Open a browser to http://localhost:4909 to view the requests

- Correction: [Scheme is actually awesome. Brian is just a curmudgeon](https://filip.lajszczak.dev/my-land-of-scheme-2025.html)
- Also: [pytest-rerunfailures is good for exposing flaky tests](https://filip.lajszczak.dev/exposing-flaky-tests-with-pytest-rerunfailures.html)
- And apparently me being wrong was a great to get at least one person to blog more.

Michael:

- Tea pot follow up
  - While you're right that some software actually had this implemented, Python does not. It's not an officially accepted HTTP status code, it was proposed in a 'joke' RFC. I guess Python - even though its name comes from the funny TV series Monty Python - is not so funny. httpx, your (or at least -my-) favorite HTTP module for python, does have the I_AM_A_TEAPOT constant.
  - By the way, there are some HTTP status codes that changed their names in RFC 9110, for instance, http.HTTPStatus.UNPROCESSABLE_CONTENT (422, previously UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)
