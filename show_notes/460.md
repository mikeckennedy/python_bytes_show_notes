**Brian #1: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) starts today**

- A few changes, like 12 days this year, which honestly, I’m grateful for.

**Michael #2: [Django 6 is coming](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/6.0/)**

- *Expected December 2025*
- Django 6.0 supports Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14
- Built-in support for the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/security/#security-csp) standard is now available, making it easier to protect web applications against content injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
- The [Django Template Language](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/templates/#template-language-intro) now supports [template partials](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/templates/language/#template-partials), making it easier to encapsulate and reuse small named fragments within a template file.
- Django now includes a built-in Tasks framework for running code outside the HTTP request–response cycle. This enables offloading work, such as sending emails or processing data, to background workers.
- Email handling in Django now uses Python’s modern email API, introduced in Python 3.6. This API, centered around the [**`email.message.EmailMessage`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.message.html#email.message.EmailMessage) class

**Brian #3: [Advanced, Overlooked Python Typing](https://martynassubonis.substack.com/p/advanced-overlooked-python-typing)**

- get_args, TypeGuard, TypeIs, and more goodies

**Michael #4: [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell)**

- Learned from [this PR for the Talk Python book](https://github.com/mikeckennedy/talk-python-in-production-devops-book/pull/14).
- Fix common misspellings in text files.
- It's designed primarily for checking misspelled words in source code (backslash escapes are skipped), but it can be used with other files as well.
- It does not check for word membership in a complete dictionary, but instead looks for a set of common misspellings. Therefore it should catch errors like "adn", but it will not catch "adnasdfasdf".
- It shouldn't generate false-positives when you use a niche term it doesn't know about.

**Extras**

Michael:

- Follow up on tach from Gerben Dekker:
  - **`tach` has been unmaintained for a bit but is not anymore**. It was the main product from Gauge which is a Y combinator startup that pivoted to something unrelated and abandoned `tach`. However, https://github.com/DetachHead forked it but now got access to the main repo and has committed to maintaining it.
  - `ruff analyze graph` is fully independent of `tach` - we actually started to look into alternatives for `tach` when it became unmaintained and then found `ruff analyze graph`.
  - For our use case, with just a bit of manipulation on top of `ruff analyze graph` we replaced our use of `deptry` (which was slower - and I try to be careful depending on one-man projects).
- [A Review of Michael Kennedy’s book, “Talk Python in Production”](https://happycanvasandcode.com/posts/my_review/) - Thanks Doug
