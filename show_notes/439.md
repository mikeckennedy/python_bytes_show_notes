**Michael #1: [ty documentation site and uv migration guide](https://docs.astral.sh/ty)**

- via Skyler Kasko
- Astral created [a documentation site for ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty) (PR [#744](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/pull/744) in release [0.0.1-alpha.13](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/releases/tag/0.0.1-alpha.13)).
- Astral added [a page on migrating from pip to a uv project](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/migration/pip-to-project) in the uv documentation.  (PR [#12382](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12382) in release [0.7.19](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.7.19)).

**Brian #2: [uv build backend is now stable](https://pydevtools.com/blog/uv-build-backend/) + other Astral news**

- [**The uv build backend is now stable**](https://pydevtools.com/blog/uv-build-backend/)

  - Tim Hopper via Python Developer Tooling Handbook

- [From Charlie Marsh](https://bsky.app/profile/crmarsh.com/post/3lszmqo27b224)

  - “The uv build backend is now stable, and considered ready for production use. An alternative to setuptools, hatchling, etc. for pure Python projects, with a focus on good defaults, user-friendly error messages, and performance. When used with uv, it's 10-35x faster.”
  - “(In a future release, we'll make this the default.)”

  ```toml
  [build-system]
  requires = ["uv_build>=0.7.19,<0.8.0"]
  build-backend = "uv_build"
  ```

  - I believe it’s faster, but I agree with [Brett Canno](https://bsky.app/profile/snarky.ca/post/3lt3ozeg7jk27)n in asking “What's being benchmarked? I'm not sure what a "backend sync" is referring to other than maybe installing the build back-end?”

**Brian #3: [Refactoring long boolean expressions](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/refactoring-boolean-expressions/)**

- Trey Hunner

- This is applied boolean logic, and even folks who learned this in a CS program probably did so early on, and may have forgotten it.

- How can you improve the readability of long Boolean expressions in Python?

  - Put parens around the whole expression and separate clauses onto different lines

  - Where to put boolean operators between clauses? at the end of the line or the beginning?

    - PEP8 recommends the beginning

    ```python
    if (expression1
        and expression2
        and expression3):
        ...
    ```

  - Naming sub-expressions with variables

    - Odd downside that wouldn’t occur to me. All expressions are evaluated, thus not taking advantage of expression short-circuiting.

  - Naming operations with functions

    - Less readable, but takes advantage of short-circuiting

  - Using De Morgan’s Law : replacing a compound expression with a similar (and hopefully easier to read) expression

    ```python
    # neither: we want both to be false
    not (a or b) == (not a) and (not b)
    
    # never_both: at least one false
    not (a and b) == (not a) or (not b)
    ```

**Michael #4: [fastapi-ml-skeleton](https://github.com/eightBEC/fastapi-ml-skeleton)**

- FastAPI Skeleton App to serve machine learning models production-ready.
- This repository contains a skeleton app which can be used to speed-up your next machine learning project.
- The code is fully tested and provides a preconfigured `tox` to quickly expand this sample code.
- A sample regression model for house price prediction is included in this project.
- Short write up on "[What does set -a do?](https://blobs.pythonbytes.fm/what-does-set-a-do.html)"

- Extra Airflow ruff rules:

  Starting from Ruff version 0.11.13, most changes from Airflow 2 to Airflow 3 can be automated using AIR3. (It’s still in preview so a “—-preview” flag is needed)

  e.g., if you have the following Airflow 2 code

  ```python
  import datetime
  
  from airflow.models import DAG
  from airflow.operators.empty import EmptyOperator
  
  with DAG(
  	dag_id="my_dag_name",
  	start_date=datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1),
  	schedule_interval="@daily",
  ):
  EmptyOperator(task_id="task")
  ```

  it can be fixed with `uvx ruff check --select AIR3 --fix --unsafe-fixes --preview`

  ```python
  import datetime
  
  from airflow.sdk import DAG
  from airflow.providers.standard.operators.empty import EmptyOperator
  
  with DAG(
  	dag_id="my_dag_name",
  	start_date=datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1),
  	schedule="@daily",
  ):
  EmptyOperator(task_id="task")
  ```

  which works with Airflow 3.
