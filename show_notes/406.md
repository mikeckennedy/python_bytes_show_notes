- Steps
  - Pay Open Source maintainers. 
    - Min to participate is 2k/year/dev at your company
  - Self-report annually
    - Publish a blog post outlining your payments
- [Armin’s post](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/10/14/mixing-oss-and-money/) about launching Open Source Pledge and mixing money with open source

**Michael #2:** Jeff Triplet's [DjangoTV](https://djangotv.com)

- Filter by conference
- Good search as well

**Brian #3:** [PEP 735 – Dependency Groups in pyproject.toml](https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/)

- Author: Stephen Rosen, Sponsor: Brett Cannon, PEP-Delegate: Paul Moore
- Accepted. Resolotion Oct 10, 2024
- “This PEP specifies a mechanism for storing package requirements in pyproject.toml files such that they are not included in any built distribution of the project.”
- Allow us to define named groups of dependencies that can be independent of the main project.
- ex:

```
[dependency-groups]
test = ["pytest", "coverage"]
docs = ["sphinx", "sphinx-rtd-theme"]
typing = ["mypy", "types-requests"]
typing-test = [{include-group = "typing"}, {include-group = "test"}, "useful-types"]
```

- “might” work like this: pip install --dependency-groups=test,typing
  - but tool venders are able to define how they use groups. Of course.
- Similar solutions 
  - multiple requirements.txt files: requirements_test.txt, requirements_docs.txt, etc.
    - no standard naming convention, not standardized 
  - package extras: 
    - not gauranteed to be statically defined (TIL)
    - additional to main dependencies, so not independent

**Michael #4:** [livereload](https://livereload.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

- Example from talkpython.fm: [**asset_bundler_watcher.py**](https://gist.github.com/mikeckennedy/4e1378477a6d174aa8d59921f8db89c3)
- [The docs are sparse](https://livereload.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), so see the gist above

**Joke:** 

- A programmer’s partner asks them: “Would you go get a loaf of bread from the store? And if they have eggs, get a dozen.” 
- A while later, the programmer returns with 12 loaves of bread and says “They had eggs.”
