**Brian #1:** [**Git: Force push safely with**](https://adamj.eu/tech/2023/10/31/git-force-push-safely/)[ ](https://adamj.eu/tech/2023/10/31/git-force-push-safely/)[**--force-with-lease**](https://adamj.eu/tech/2023/10/31/git-force-push-safely/)[ **and**](https://adamj.eu/tech/2023/10/31/git-force-push-safely/)[ ](https://adamj.eu/tech/2023/10/31/git-force-push-safely/)[**--force-if-includes**](https://adamj.eu/tech/2023/10/31/git-force-push-safely/)

- Adam Johnson
- Using gentle force 
- Avoid stomping on remote changes with a couple extra flags.

**Michael #2:** **Thoughts from PyCon 2024**

- PyCon is special - the connections you make are always more than you expect
- Great to see many old friends
- Did a ”live” Talk Python episode that’ll be out in a few weeks.
- The talks look great, we’ll let you know when they land on YouTube.
- Masks were a mistake - universally heard complaints from fellow attendees. This is my two cents towards a more reasonable next PyCon.

**Brian #3:**  [**Being friendly: Strategies for friendly fork management**](https://github.blog/2022-05-02-friend-zone-strategies-friendly-fork-management/)

- That’s part 2. 
- Part 1 is [Being friendly: Friendly forks 101](https://github.blog/2022-04-25-the-friend-zone-friendly-forks-101/)
- Lessley Dennington on GitHub Blog
- Examples of long running friendly forks
  - git-for-windows/git, microsift/git, github/git
  - two public, one private
- Fork management strategies - when pulling changes downstream
  - merging rebase 
    - git-for-windows/git uses this proactively and regularly
    - fake merge + rebase
  - new branch 
    - microsoft/git uses this
    - new branch from upstream major versions
    - merge previous changes to new branch
  - traditional merge 
    - github/git uses this, conservatively, after a few point bug fix versions

**Michael #4:** [**tach**](https://github.com/gauge-sh/tach)

- A Python tool to enforce a modular, decoupled package architecture.
- tach allows you to define boundaries and control dependencies between your Python packages. 
- Each package can define its public interface.
- If a package tries to import from another package that is not listed as a dependency, tach will report an error. 
- If a package tries to import from another package and does not use its public interface, with strict: true set, tach will report an error.
- Zero runtime impact.
