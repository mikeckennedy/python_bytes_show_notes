**Michael #1:** [**git-flight-rules**](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules)

- What are "flight rules"?
  - A guide for astronauts (now, programmers using Git) about what to do when things go wrong.
  - Flight Rules are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures. [...]
  - NASA has been capturing our missteps, disasters and solutions since the early 1960s, when Mercury-era ground teams first started gathering "lessons learned" into a compendium that now lists thousands of problematic situations, from engine failure to busted hatch handles to computer glitches, and their solutions.
- Steps for common operations and actions

  - [What did I just commit?](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules?tab=readme-ov-file#what-did-i-just-commit)
  - [I want to discard specific unstaged changes](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules?tab=readme-ov-file#i-want-to-discard-specific-unstaged-changes)

**Brian #2:** [**Uravelling t-strings**](https://snarky.ca/unravelling-t-strings/)

- Brett Cannon
- Article walks through
  - Evaluating the Python expression
  - Applying specified conversions
  - Applying format specs
  - Using an Interpolation class to hold details of replacement fields
  - Using Template class to hold parsed data
- Plus, you don’t have to have Python 3.14.0b1 to try this out.
- The end result is very close to an [example used in PEP 750](https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/#example-implementing-f-strings-with-t-strings), which you do need 3.14.0b1 to try out.
- See also:
  - I’ve written a pytest version, [Unravelling t-strings with pytest](https://pythontest.com/unravelling-t-strings-pytest/), if you want to run all the examples with one file.

**Michael #3:** [**neohtop**](https://github.com/Abdenasser/neohtop)

- Blazing-fast system monitoring for your desktop
- Features
  - Real-time process monitoring
  - CPU and Memory usage tracking
  - Beautiful, modern UI with dark/light themes
  - Advanced process search and filtering
  - Pin important processes
  - Process management (kill processes)
  - Sort by any column
  - Auto-refresh system stats

**Brian #4:** [Introducing Pyrefly: A new type checker and IDE experience for Python](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/05/15/developer-tools/introducing-pyrefly-a-new-type-checker-and-ide-experience-for-python/)

- From Facebook / Meta
- Another Python type checker written in Rust
- Built with IDE integration in mind from the beginning
- Principles
  - Performance
  - IDE first
  - Inference (inferring types in untyped code)
  - Open source
- I mistakenly tried this on the project I support with the most horrible abuses of the dynamic nature of Python, [pytest-check](https://github.com/okken/pytest-check). It didn’t go well. But perhaps the project is ready for some refactoring. I’d like to try it soon on a more well behaved project.

**Extras**

- [pocket is closing](https://getpocket.com/farewell), I’m switching to [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io)
  - I got one question about code formatting. It’s not highlighted, but otherwise not bad.
