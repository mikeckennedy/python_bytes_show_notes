**Brian #1:** [**NumFOCUS concerns**](https://pirsquared.org/blog/numfocus-concerns.html)

- Suggested by Pamphile Roy
- Write up of the current challenges faced by NumFOCUS, by Paul Ivanov  (one of the OG of Scientific Python: Jupyter, Matplotlib, etc.)
  - Struggling to meet the needs of sponsored and affiliated projects.
  - In February, NumFOCUS announced it is moving in a new direction.
  - NumFOCUS initiated an effort to run an election for open board seats and proposed changing its governance structure.
  - Some projects are considering and actively pursuing alternative venues for fiscal sponsorship.
  - Quite a bit more detail and discussion in the article.
- [NumFOCUS covers a lot of projects](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects)
  - NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, Jupyter, SciPy, Astropy, Bokeh, Dask, Conda, and so many more.

**Michael #2:** [leaping pytest debugger llm](https://github.com/leapingio/leaping)

- You can ask Leaping questions like:
  - Why am I not hitting function x?
  - Why was variable y set to this value?
  - What was the value of variable x at this point?
  - What changes can I make to this code to make this test pass?

**Brian #3:** **Extra, Extra, Extra,**

- [2024 Developer Summit](https://scientific-python.org/summits/developer/2024/) 
  - Also suggested by Pamphile, related to Scientific Python
  - *The Second Scientific Python Developer Summit , June 3-5, Seattle, WA*
  - Lots of great work came out of the [First Summit in 2023](https://blog.scientific-python.org/scientific-python/dev-summit-1/)
- [pytest-regex](https://github.com/tylerjereddy/pytest-regex) - Use regexs to specify tests to run
  - Came out of the ’23 summit
  - I’m not sure if I’m super happy about this or a little afraid that I probably could use this.
  - Still, cool that it’s here.
- [Cool short example of using ](https://jcarlosroldan.com/post/329/my-latest-tils-about-python)[__init__](https://jcarlosroldan.com/post/329/my-latest-tils-about-python)[ and ](https://jcarlosroldan.com/post/329/my-latest-tils-about-python)[__call__](https://jcarlosroldan.com/post/329/my-latest-tils-about-python)[ to hand-roll a decorator.](https://jcarlosroldan.com/post/329/my-latest-tils-about-python)

**Michael #4:**  [PyPI has completed its first security audit](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-11-14-1-pypi-completes-first-security-audit/)

- Trail of Bits spent a total of 10 engineer-weeks of effort identifying issues, presenting those findings to the PyPI team, and assisting us as we remediated the findings.
- Scope: The audit was focused on "Warehouse", the open-source codebase that powers [pypi.org](https://pypi.org)
- As a result of the audit, Trail of Bits detailed 29 different advisories discovered across both codebases. When evaluating severity level of each advisory, 14 were categorized as "informational", 6 as "low", 8 as "medium" and zero as "high".

**Extras**
