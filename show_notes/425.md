**Michael #1:** [Why aren't you using uv](https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1899928805742899231)?

- Fun conversation on X by [Armin Ronacher](https://x.com/mitsuhiko).
- Interesting quotes from the thread
  - I get it replaces pip/pyenv, but should I also use it instead of the built in 'python -m venv .venv'?
  - But I need python installed to make python programs?
  - Because it places the venv in the project folder and I can't run executables from there due to corporate policy. Many such cases. No idea why astral doesn't address this with more urgency.
    - Sounds like a bad corporate policy :)
  - i’m too lazy to switch from pyenv and pip
  - trust issues, what if they do a bait and switch …
  - Because everyone said that about poetry and I'm not sure I'm really ready to get hurt again.
  - Masochism
  - Many times I tried a lot of similar tools and always come back to pip and pip-tools. Them are just work, why should I spend my time for something "cool" that will bring more problems?
  - I tried this week but I was expecting a "uv install requests" instead of "uv add". Switched back to pipenv.
  - we partially use it. will transition when Dependabot support is available.
- I’ll leave it with → Jared Scheel: Seeing a whole lotta Stockholm Syndrome in the replies to this question.

**Brian #2:** [Python Developer Tooling Handbook](https://pydevtools.com/handbook/)

- Tim Hopper
- “This is not a book about programming Python. Instead, the goal of this book is to help you understand the ecosystem of tools used to make Python development easier and more productive”
- Covers tools related to packaging, linting, formatting, and managing dependencies. 

**Michael #3:** [**Calling all doc writers: blacken-docs**](https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs)

- Run `black` on python code blocks in documentation files 
- You can also install blacken-docs as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook.
- It supports Markdown, reStructuredText, and LaTex files. 
- Additionally, you can run it on Python files to reformat Markdown and reStructuredText within docstrings.

**Brian #4:** [Reinventing notebooks as reusable Python programs](https://marimo.io/blog/python-not-json?_bhlid=137e05f1384ff987aef74d01decfeb08d76910c7)

- marimo allows you to store notebooks as plaintext Python files
- properties
  - Git-friendly: small code change => small diff
  - easy for both humans and computers to read
  - importable as a Python module, without executing notebook cells
  - executable as a Python script
  - editable with a text editor
- Also, … testing with pytest
- “Because marimo notebooks are just Python files, they are interoperable with other tools for Python — including pytest. “
- “**Testing cells.** Any cell named as test_* is automatically discoverable and testable by pytest. The same goes for any cell that contains only test_ functions and Test classes.”
- “Importantly, because cells are wrapped in functions, running pytest test_notebook.py doesn’t execute the entire notebook — just its tests.”

**Extras** 

Brian:

- PyConUS announces [Refund Policy for International Attendees](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2025/03/refund-policy-for-international.html)
- New format now live for [The Complete pytest Course Bundle](https://courses.pythontest.com) and component courses
  - Each course now available separately also
    - [pytest Primary Power](https://courses.pythontest.com/pytest-primary-power) is 13 lessons, 3.9 hours
    - [Using pytest with Projects](https://courses.pythontest.com/using-pytest-with-projects), 10 lessons, 3.4 hours
    - [pytest Booster Rockets](https://courses.pythontest.com/pytest-booster-rockets), 6 lessons, 1.3 hours of content
  - New format is easier to navigate
  - Better for people who like different speeds. I’m usually a 1.25x-1.5x speed person.
  - Now also with Congratulations! lessons (with fireworks) and printable certificates.

Michael:

- [PyCon Taiwan is currently calling for proposals](https://tw.pycon.org/2025/en-us/speaking/cfp)
- HN trends follow up via Shinjitsu

- I'm sure some other Hacker News reader has already given you the

- feedback, but in the unlikely case that they haven't, You read those

- headlines in this segment exactly wrong.

- “Ask HN: Who is hiring?" is a monthly post that asks employers to post

- about jobs they have available

- “Ask HN: Who wants to be hired?” is a monthly topic where they ask

- people who are looking for jobs to post about themselves in the hope

- that their skillset it is a good match (and not an LLM generated resume)

- so unfortunately your rosy analysis might need a less rosy

- interpretation.

**Joke:**
