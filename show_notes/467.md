**Michael #1:** [GreyNoise IP Check](https://check.labs.greynoise.io)

- GreyNoise watches the internet's background radiation—the constant storm of scanners, bots, and probes hitting every IP address on Earth.
- Is your computer sending out bot or other bad-actor traffic? What about the myriad of devices and IoT things on your local IP?
- Heads up: If your IP has recently changed, it might not be you (false positive).

Brian #2: [tprof: a targeting profiler](https://pypi.org/project/tprof/)

**Michael #3: [TOAD is out](https://github.com/batrachianai/toad)**

- Toad is a unified experience for AI in the terminal
- Front-end for AI tools such as [OpenHands](https://openhands.dev/), [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code), [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/), and many more.
- Better TUI experience (e.g. @ for file context uses fuzzy search and dropdowns)
- Better prompt input (mouse, keyboard, even colored code and markdown blocks)
- Terminal within terminals (for TUI support)

**Brian #4**: [FastAPI adds Contribution Guidelines around AI usage](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pull/14706/files)

- Docs commit: [**Add contribution instructions about LLM generated code and comments and automated tools for PRs**](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pull/14706/files)
- Docs section: [Development - Contributing : Automated Code and AI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/?h=contributin#automated-code-and-ai)
- Great inspiration and example of how to deal with this for popular open source projects
  - “If the **human effort** put in a PR, e.g. writing LLM prompts, is **less** than the **effort we would need to put** to **review it**, please **don't** submit the PR.”
- With sections on
  - Closing Automated and AI PRs
  - Human Effort Denial of Service
  - Use Tools Wisely

  - [Blocking AI crawlers might be a bad idea](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/why-hiding-from-ai-crawlers-is-a-bad-idea/) on Michael’s Blog
- Already using the compile flag for faster app startup on the containers:
  - `RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache uv pip install --compile-bytecode --python /venv/bin/python`
  - I think it’s speeding startup by about 1s / container.
