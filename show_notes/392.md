**Brian #3:** [**Incident Report: Leaked GitHub Personal Access Token**](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-07-08-incident-report-leaked-admin-personal-access-token/)

- Suggested by Galen Swint
- See also JFrog blog: [Binary secret scanning helped us prevent](https://jfrog.com/blog/leaked-pypi-secret-token-revealed-in-binary-preventing-suppy-chain-attack/)[ ](https://jfrog.com/blog/leaked-pypi-secret-token-revealed-in-binary-preventing-suppy-chain-attack/)[(what](https://jfrog.com/blog/leaked-pypi-secret-token-revealed-in-binary-preventing-suppy-chain-attack/)[ might have been) the worst supply chain attack you can imagine](https://jfrog.com/blog/leaked-pypi-secret-token-revealed-in-binary-preventing-suppy-chain-attack/)
- A GitHub access token found it’s way into a .pyc file, then into a docker image.
- JFrog found it through some regular scans.
- JFrog notified PYPI security.
- Token was destroyed within 17 minutes. (nice turnaround)
- Followup scan revealed that no harm was done.
- Takaways (from Ee Durbin): 
  - Set aggressive expiration dates for API tokens (If you need them at all)
  - Treat .pyc files as if they were source code
  - Perform builds on automated systems from clean source only.
