**Michael #1: Distributed sqlite follow up: [Turso](https://turso.tech) and [Litestream](https://litestream.io)**

- Michael Booth:
  - [Turso](https://turso.tech) marries the familiarity and simplicity of SQLite with modern, scalable, and distributed features.
  - Seems to me that Turso is to SQLite what MotherDuck is to DuckDB.
- Mike Fiedler
  - Continue to use the SQLite you love and care about (even the one inside Python runtime) and launch a daemon that watches the db for changes and replicates changes to an S3-type object store.
  - Deeper dive: [Litestream: Revamped](https://fly.io/blog/litestream-revamped/)

**Brian #2: [PEP 792 – Project status markers in the simple index](https://peps.python.org/pep-0792/)**

- Currently 3 status markers for packages
  - Trove Classifier status
  - Indices can be yanked
  - PyPI projects - admins can quarantine a project, owners can archive a project
- Proposal is to have something that can have only one state
  - active
  - archived
  - quarantined
  - deprecated
- This has been Approved, but not Implemented yet.

**Brian #3:** [Run coverage on tests](https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/run-coverage-on-tests/)

- Hugo van Kemenade
- And apparently, run Ruff with at least F811 turned on
- Helps with copy/paste/modify mistakes, but also subtler bugs like consumed generators being reused.

**Michael #4:** [docker2exe](https://github.com/rzane/docker2exe): Convert a Docker image to an executable

- This tool can be used to convert a Docker image to an executable that you can send to your friends.
- Build with a simple command: `$ docker2exe --name alpine --image alpine:3.9`
- Requires docker on the client device
- Probably doesn’t map volumes/ports/etc, though could potentially be exposed in the dockerfile.

**Extras**

Brian:

- Back catalog of Test & Code  is now on YouTube under @TestAndCodePodcast
  - So far 106 of 234 episodes are up. The rest are going up according to daily limits.
  - Ordering is rather chaotic, according to upload time, not release ordering.
- There will be a new episode this week
  - pytest-django with Adam Johnson
