**#6 Michael:  [Hy: A wonderful dialect of Lisp that's embedded in Python](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/)**

- Since Hy transforms its Lisp code into the Python Abstract Syntax Tree, you have the whole beautiful world of Python at your fingertips, in Lisp form!
- Listener recommended: [http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/)
- You must try: [https://try-hy.appspot.com/](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/)
- This is pretty cool because it means Hy is several things:
  - A Lisp that feels very Pythonic
  - For Lispers, a great way to use Lisp’s crazy powers but in the wide world of Python’s libraries (why yes, you now can write a Django application in Lisp!)
  - For Pythonistas, a great way to start exploring Lisp, from the comfort of Python!
  - For everyone: a pleasant language that has a lot of neat ideas!
