**Michael #1:**[ pirel: Python release cycle in your terminal](https://github.com/RafaelWO/pirel)

- pirel check shows release information about your active Python interpreter.
- If the active version is end-of-life, the program exits with code 1. If no active Python interpreter is found, the program exits with code 2.
- pirel list lists all Python releases in a table. Your active Python interpreter is highlighted.
- A picture is worth many words

**Brian #2:**  [**FastAPI Cloud**](https://fastapicloud.com)

- Sebastián Ramírez, creator of FastAPI, [announced today](https://bsky.app/profile/tiangolo.com/post/3lognxjvw4225) the formation of a new Company, FastAPI Cloud.
- Here’s the announcement blog post: [FastAPI Cloud - By The Same Team Behind FastAPI](https://fastapicloud.com/blog/fastapi-cloud-by-the-same-team-behind-fastapi)
- There’s a wait list to try it out.
- Promises to turns deployment into fastapi login; fastapi deploy
- Side note: announcement includes quote from Daft Punk: Build Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger
  - I just included this in a talk I’m gave last week (and will again next week), where I modify this to “Build Easier, Better, Faster, Stronger”
  - Sebastian and I are both fans of the rocket emoji.
- BTW, [we first covered FastAPI on episode 123 in 2019](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/123/time-to-right-the-py-wrongs)

**Brian #3:** [Python's new t-strings](https://davepeck.org/2025/04/11/pythons-new-t-strings/)

- Dave Peck, one of the authors of PEP 750, which will go into Python 3.14
- We covered t-strings in [ep 428](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/428/how-old-is-your-python)
- In article
  - t-strings security benefits over f-strings
  - How to work with t-strings
  - A Pig Latin example
    - Also, I think I have always done this wrong
    - Is it the first consonant to the end? or the first consonant cluster?
    - So… Brian → Rianbay? or Ianbray?
    - BTW, this is an example of nerdgassing
  - What’s next once t-strings ship?
- On thing that’s next (in Python 3.15, maybe, is using t-strings in shlex and subprocess)
  - [PEP 787 – Safer subprocess usage using t-strings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0787/) deferred to 3.15

**Michael #4**: [zev](https://github.com/dtnewman/zev)

- A simple CLI tool to help you remember terminal commands.
- Examples:

```
# Find running processes
zev 'show all running python processes'
# File operations
zev 'find all .py files modified in the last 24 hours'
# System information
zev 'show disk usage for current directory'
# Network commands
zev 'check if google.com is reachable'
# Git operations
zev 'show uncommitted changes in git'
```

- Again, picture worth many words:
