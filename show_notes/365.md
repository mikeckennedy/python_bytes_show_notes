**Michael #1:** [**Hatch v1.8**](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/blog/2023/12/11/hatch-v180/)

- Hatch now manages installing Python for you.
- Hatch can build .app and .exe stand-alone binaries for you
- The macOS ones are signed (signed!)
- Discussion [here](https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-hatch-v1-8-0/40865)

**Brian #2:** [**svcs : A Flexible Service Locator for Python**](https://svcs.hynek.me/en/stable/)

- Hynek
- A library to help structure and test Python web applications.
- ‚Äú*svcs* (pronounced *services*) is a **dependency container** for Python. It gives you a central place to register factories for types/interfaces and then imperatively acquire instances of those types with **automatic cleanup** and **health checks**.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúBenefits:
    - Eliminates tons of repetitive **boilerplate** code,
    - unifies **acquisition** and **cleanups** of services,
    - provides full *static* **type safety** for them,
    - simplifies **testing** through **loose coupling**,
    - improves *live* **introspection** and **monitoring** with **health checks**.‚Äù
- Hynek has started a [YouTube channel, and is starting with an explanation of svcs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1elMD9WgpAhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1elMD9WgpA)
- Yes, Hynek, we want more videos. I like that it‚Äôs not a beginner level. 
- My request for future videos: just past beginner, and also intermediate level.
- There are plenty of basics videos out there, not as many filling the gaps between beginner and production.


**Michael #3:** [Steering Council 2024 Term Election Results](https://discuss.python.org/t/steering-council-election-results-2024-term/40851) 

- The 2024 Term Python Steering Council is:
    - Pablo Galindo Salgado
    - Gregory P. Smith
    - Emily Morehouse
    - Barry Warsaw
    - Thomas Wouters
- Full results are available in [PEP 8105](https://peps.python.org/pep-8105/#results) .
- How do you become a candidate?
    - Candidates must be nominated by a core team member. If the candidate is a core team member, they may nominate themselves.

**Brian #4:** [**Python protocols. When to use them in your projects to abstract and decoupling**](https://typethepipe.com/post/python-protocols-when-to-use)

- Carlos Vecina
- ‚ÄúProtocols are an alternative (or a complement) to inheritance, abstract classes and Mixins.‚Äù
- Understanding interactions between ABC, MixIns and Protocols in Python
- With examples

**Extras** 

Brian:

- Donations. It‚Äôs a decent time of the year to donate to projects that help you
    - [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2023-q4-drive/)
    - [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/)
    - [Python Bytes](https://www.patreon.com/pythonbytes)
    - Also, look for ‚ÄúSponsor this project‚Äù links in GitHub for projects you depend on.

Michael:

- **Mastodon guidelines** (mine):
    - If you have a picture and description, I‚Äôll probably follow you back
    - If you have posts that seem relevant +1
    - If you have a verified webpage +1
    - If your account is private, won‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt understand really since private group messages already exist and the profile itself is public.
- Speaking of Mastodon. I had a productive conversation with the PSF and others around masks and conferences.
- [Dropbox spooks users by sending data to OpenAI for AI search features](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/dropbox-spooks-users-by-sending-data-to-openai-for-ai-search-features/)
    - There was a comment in the above article to the effect of ‚ÄúOnce you give your data to a third party (even trusted like Dropbox), you no longer control that data.‚Äù That sent me searching and thinking‚Ä¶
    - [sync.com](https://www.sync.com/?_sync_refer=721a76dd0)? [proton drive](https://proton.me/drive) ([discount code](https://pr.tn/ref/4SM38ZQPNS3G))? [nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com)? [filen.io](https://filen.io)? [icedrive.net](https://icedrive.net)?
    - ownCloud‚Äôs [recent CVE](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/cve-2023-49103-owncloud-critical-vulnerability-quickly-exploited-in-the-wild) makes me a bit nervous of self-hosted options.
    - Either way, [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org) is very interesting.
- Beyond privacy, this got me thinking, just how many hours of dev time have been diverted to add mediocre-at-best AI features to everything?
- I‚Äôm doing a big digital decluttering and have lots to say on that soon.
- **Not** submitting my talks to PyCascades this year. 
- But I **did submit** 3 talks to PyCon US. ü§û 
- I **will** be giving the keynote at [PyCon Philippines](https://pycon-2024.python.ph).
