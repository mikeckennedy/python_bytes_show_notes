  - or use save50 for 50% off, your choice.
- [Python Testing with pytest, 2nd edition](https://pragprog.com/titles/bopytest2/python-testing-with-pytest-second-edition/), eBook (50% off with code save50) also through November
  - I would have picked 20%, but it’s a PragProg wide thing

**Michael #1: [PEP 814 – Add frozendict built-in type](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-814-add-frozendict-built-in-type/104854)**

- by Victor Stinner & Donghee Na
- A new public immutable type `frozendict` is added to the `builtins` module.
- We expect `frozendict` to be safe by design, as it prevents any unintended modifications. This addition benefits not only CPython’s standard library, but also third-party maintainers who can take advantage of a reliable, immutable dictionary type.
- To add to [existing frozen types in Python](https://blobs.pythonbytes.fm/existing-frozen-typesstructures-in-python.html?cache_id=be7da5).

**Brian #2: From [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)  to [Zensical](https://zensical.org)**

- Suggested by John Hagen
- A lot of people, me included, use Material for MkDocs as our MkDocs theme for both personal and professional projects, and in-house docs.
- This plugin for MkDocs is [now in maintenance mode](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/8523)
- The development team is switching to working on Zensical, a static site generator to overcome some technical limitations with MkDocs. There’s a series of posts about the transition and reasoning
  1. [Transforming Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/2024/08/19/how-were-transforming-material-for-mkdocs/)
  2. [Zensical – A modern static site generator built by the creators of Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/2025/11/05/zensical/)
  3. [Material for MkDocs Insiders – Now free for everyone](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/2025/11/11/insiders-now-free-for-everyone/)
  4. [Goodbye, GitHub Discussions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/2025/11/18/goodbye-github-discussions/)
- Material for MkDocs
  - still around, but in maintenance mode
  - all insider features now available to everyone
- Zensical is / will be
  - compatible with Material for Mkdocs, can natively read mkdocs.yml, to assist with the transition
  - Open Source, MIT license
  - funded by an offering for professional users: Zensical Spark

**Michael #3: [Tach](https://github.com/tach-org/tach)**

- Keep the streak: pip deps with uv + tach
- From Gerben Decker
- We needed some more control over linting our dependency structure, both internal and external.
- We use `tach` (which you covered before IIRC), but also some home built linting rules for our specific structure. These are extremely easy to build using an underused feature of `ruff`:  "uv run ruff analyze graph --python python_exe_path .".
- [Example from an app](https://app.gauge.sh/show?uid=fee5a5ca-7f89-4f0a-bcf7-bca1f7c6cc8a) I’m working on (shhhhh not yet announced!)

**Brian #4: Some Python Speedups in 3.15 and 3.16**

- [**A Plan for 5-10%\* Faster Free-Threaded JIT by Python 3.16**](https://fidget-spinner.github.io/posts/faster-jit-plan.html)
  - 5% faster by 3.15 and 10% faster by 3.16
- [Decompression is up to 30% faster in CPython 3.15](https://emmatyping.dev/decompression-is-up-to-30-faster-in-cpython-315.html)
