**Brian #3: More Django (three articles)**

- [**Migrating From Celery to Django Tasks**](https://paultraylor.net/blog/2026/migrating-from-celery-to-django-tasks/)
  - Paul Taylor
  - Nice intro of how easy it is to get started with Django Tasks

  - A handful of reasons why Django is a great choice for a web framework
    - less magic than Rails
    - a built-in admin
    - nice ORM
    - automatic migrations
    - nice docs
    - you can use sqlite in production
    - built in email
  - [The definitive guide to using Django with SQLite in production](https://alldjango.com/articles/definitive-guide-to-using-django-sqlite-in-production)
    - I’m gonna have to study this a bit.
    - The conclusion states one of the benefits is “reduced complexity”, but, it still seems like quite a bit to me.

**Michael #4: [Datastar](https://data-star.dev)**

- Sent to us by Forrest Lanier

- Lots of work by Chris May

- Out [on Talk Python](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/all) soon.

- [Official Datastar Python SDK](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar-python)

- Datastar is a little like HTMX, but

  - The single source of truth is your server

  - Events can be sent from server automatically (using SSE)

    - e.g

    ```python
    yield SSE.patch_elements(
                f"""<span id="currentTime">{datetime.now().isoformat()}"""
            )
    ```
