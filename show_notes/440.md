**Brian #1: [Switching to direnv, Starship, and uv](https://treyhunner.com/2024/10/switching-from-virtualenvwrapper-to-direnv-starship-and-uv/)**

- Last week I mentioned that I’m ready to try direnv again, but secretly, I still had some worries about the process. Thankfully, Trey has a tutorial to walk me past the troublesome parts.

- [direnv](https://direnv.net) - an extension for your shell. It augments existing shells with a new feature that can load and unload environment variables depending on the current directory.

- **Switching from virtualenvwrapper to direnv, Starship, and uv

   \- Trey Hunner**

  - Trey has solved a bunch of the problems I had when I tried direnv before

    - Show the virtual environment name in the prompt

    - Place new virtual environments in local `.venv` instead of in `.direnv/python3.12`

    - Silence all of the “loading”, “unloading” statements every time you enter a directory

    - Have a script called 

      ```
      venv
      ```

       to create an environment, activate it, create a 

      ```
      .envrc
      ```

       file

      - I’m more used to a `create` script, so I’ll stick with that name and Trey’s contents

    - A 

      ```
      workon
      ```

       script to be able to switch around to different projects.

      - This is a carry over from “virtualenvwrapper’, but seems cool. I’ll take it.

    - Adding 

      ```
      uv
      ```

       to the mix for creating virtual environments.

      - Interestingly including `--seed` which, for one, installs `pip` in the new environment. (Some tools need it, even if you don’t)

  - Starship

    - Trey also has some setup for Starship. But I’ll get through the above first, then MAYBE try Starship again.
    - Some motivation
      - Trey’s setup is pretty simple. Maybe I was trying to get too fancy before
      - Starship config in toml files that can be loaded with direnv and be different for different projects. Neato
      - Also, Trey mentions his dotfiles repo. This is a cool idea that I’ve been meaning to do for a long time.

**Michael #2: [rqlite - Distributed SQLite DB](https://rqlite.io)**

- [via themlu, thanks](https://fosstodon.org/@themlu/114852806589871969)!
- rqlite is a lightweight, user-friendly, distributed relational database built on SQLite.
- Built on SQLite, the world’s most popular database
- Supports full-text search, Vector Search, and JSON documents
- Access controls and encryption for secure deployments

**Michael #3**: [A Python dict that can report which keys you did not use](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/a-python-dict-that-can-report-which-keys-you-did-not-use)

- by Peter Bengtsson
- Very cool for testing that a dictionary has been used as expected (e.g. all data has been sent out via an API or report).
- Note: It does NOT track d.get(), but it’s easy to just add it to the class in the post.
- Maybe someone should polish it up and put it on pypi (that person is not me :) ).

**Brian #4: Some Markdown Stuff**

- Textual 4.0.0

   adds Markdown.append which can be used to efficiently stream markdown content

  - The reason for the major bump is due to an interface change to Widget.anchor
  - Refreshing to see a symantic change cause a major version bump.

- html-to-markdown

  * Converts html to markdown

  - A complete rewrite fork of markdownify
  - Lots of fun features like “streaming support”
    - Curious if it can stream to Textual’s Markdown.append method. hmmm.
