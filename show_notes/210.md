**Brian #1:**  [**Analyzing Kickstarter Campaigns with Python Data Science Tools**](https://medium.com/swlh/kickstarter-projects-do-they-succeed-f4a789010585)

- Article title: ‚ÄúKickstarter Projects ‚Äî Do They Succeed?‚Äù
- Aditya Patkar
- Using a Kaggle dataset of 378,661-ish projects up to 2018.
- Looks at using pandas data frames to explore the data.
- Using `.describe()` data frame method to learn a lot.
- Uses matplotlib and seaborn to analyze the data further.
- Odd statement that I‚Äôm not sure is straight faced or a really dry joke: ‚ÄúThe data from 1970 seems to be bad or insignificant data.‚Äù
- Examples of using heat maps, line graphs, bar charts, to look at different aspects.
- Some results:
	- 35.64% of projects are successful (meaning goal hit)
	- tech asks for the most for goals, and has the highest average per backer.
	- Comics has the lowest pledged amount per backer average.
- Nice that you can use the techniques to ask your own questions of the data.

**Michael #2:** [**GPU Accelerated Python for Machine Learning on Cross-Vendor Graphics Cards**](https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-cuda-gpu-accelerated-python-for-machine-learning-in-cross-vendor-graphics-cards-made-simple-6cc828a45cc3)

- Building machine learning algorithms using the Vulkan Kompute Python Framework
- When you hear ‚ÄúCUDA‚Äù, that means Nvidia üôÇ
- Uses [Vulkan Kompute](https://github.com/EthicalML/vulkan-kompute) framework
- A large number of high profile (and new) machine learning frameworks such as Google‚Äôs Tensorflow, Facebook‚Äôs Pytorch, Tencent‚Äôs NCNN, Alibaba‚Äôs MNN ‚Äîbetween others ‚Äî have been adopting Vulkan as their core cross-vendor GPU computing SDK.
- As you can imagine, the Vulkan SDK provides very low-level C / C++ access to GPUs, which allows for very specialized optimizations.
- The main disadvantage is the verbosity involved, requiring 500‚Äì2000+ lines of C++ code to only get the base boilerplate required to even start writing the application logic.
- [**The Kompute Python package**](https://github.com/EthicalML/vulkan-kompute#vulkan-kompute) is built on top of the Vulkan SDK through optimized C++ bindings, which exposes Vulkan‚Äôs core computing capabilities. Kompute is the Python [GPGPU framework.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units)
- The main article talks through a couple of numerical computation examples.

**Jay** **#3:** [Adafruit PyPortal - CircuitPython Powered Internet Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116)

- Gift for the tinkering pythonista
- CircuitPy
- Use it to make plenty of cool things
- Screen/speaker/Light Sensor Built-In

**Brian** **#4:**  [**Introduction to Linear Algebra for Applied Machine Learning with Python**](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra)

- Pablo Caceres
- Intended as a reference and not a comprehensive review.
- Still, I very much appreciate it.
- Includes links to both free and paid resources to thoroughly learn linear algebra
- Covers
	- sets, ordered pairs,  relations, functions, 
	- vectors
	- matrices
	- linear and affine mappings
	- matrix decomposition
- Uses numpy, pandas, and altair  for examples
- Quick (but useful) explanations of concepts, along with how to represent and do it with numpy
- I‚Äôm really just getting into it, but I‚Äôm enjoying it and this is the right level of handholding I needed.

**Michael** **#5:** [**How many notebook frameworks? Many, and now +1 with Deepnote**](https://deepnote.com/)

- Deepnote is a new kind of data science notebook. Jupyter-compatible with real-time collaboration and running in the cloud. 
- Free for individuals, paid for teams and companies
- Real time collaboration is a key feature
- Built in versioning coming
- Code review in the notebook coming
- ‚ÄúView‚Äù your variables as a whole environment
- Better ‚Äî real ‚Äî autocomplete
- Dashboards coming too

**Jay** **#6:** [**imagekit.io**](https://imagekit.io)

- image cdn
- started using imagekit on my own website and noticed faster load times
- [allows for some responsive ‚Äúfanciness‚Äù](https://imagekit.io/features/image-transformation)
	- Add Blurs
	- Smart Cropping
- [Python API](https://github.com/imagekit-developer/imagekit-python) or URL-Schema

- Q: why can't SQL and NoSQL Developers date one other?
- A: because they don't agree on relationships.
