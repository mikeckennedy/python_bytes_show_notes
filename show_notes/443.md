**Brian #2: [Coverage 7.10.0: patch](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202507/coverage_7100_patch.html)**

- Ned Batchelder

- Actually up to 7.10.2 as of today

- patch allows coverage to run better when a covered project uses

  - subprocesses
  - os._exit()
  - execv family of functions

- Looking at subprocess

  - ‚ÄúCoverage works great when you start your program with coverage measurement, but has long had the problem of how to also measure the coverage of sub-processes that your program created. The existing solution had been a complicated two-step process of creating obscure .pth files and setting environment variables. Whole projects appeared on PyPI to handle this for you.‚Äù

- From release notes

   for 7.10.0

  - A new configuration option: ‚Äú

    [run] patch

    ‚Äù specifies named patches to work around some limitations in coverage measurement. These patches are available:

    - `patch = _exit` lets coverage save its data even when [**`os._exit()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os._exit) is used to abruptly end the process. This closes long-standing [issue 310](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/310) as well as its duplicates: [issue 312](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/312), [issue 1673](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1673), [issue 1845](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1845), and [issue 1941](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1941).
    - `patch = subprocess` measures coverage in Python subprocesses created with [**`subprocess`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess), [**`os.system()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system), or one of the [**`execv`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.execl) or [**`spawnv`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.spawnl) family of functions. Closes old [issue 367](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/367) and duplicate [issue 378](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/378).
    - `patch = execv` adjusts the [**`execv`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.execl) family of functions to save coverage data before ending the current program and starting the next. Not available on Windows. Closes [issue 43](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/43) after 15 years!

**Michael #3: [aioboto3](https://github.com/terricain/aioboto3/tree/main)**

- via Pat Decker
- Wrapper to use boto3 resources with the aiobotocore async backend
- aiobotocore allows you to use near enough all of the boto3 client commands in an async manner just by prefixing the command with `await`.
- With aioboto3 you can now use the higher level APIs provided by boto3 in an asynchronous manner.

**Brian #4: [You might not need a Python class](https://adamgrant.micro.blog/2025/07/24/123050.html)**

- Adam Grant
- This is an important periodic reminder to everyone coming into Python from other languages.
  - Many other languages lean on classes a lot more than we need to in Python
- Adams suggestions
  - Simple Data Containers: Use Named Tuples or Data Classes
  - Stateless Utility Functions: Just Use Functions
  - Grouping Constants: Use Modules
  - Managing State with Simple Structures: Use Dictionaries or Lists
  - Simple One-off Operations: Use Lambdas or Comprehensions
    - I‚Äôll add ‚Äújust use functions‚Äù
  - Avoiding Complexity: Built-in Libraries
  - When You Actually Need a Class
    - I‚Äôll add
      - You probably don‚Äôt
      - If you think you do, ask a friend. Friends don‚Äôt let friends create extraneous classes in Python.
      - If you think your case is an exception, it probably isn‚Äôt
      - If you think dataclasses aren‚Äôt right for you, check out [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/index.html)
