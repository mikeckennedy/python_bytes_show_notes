**Brian #1: [Open Source Security work isn't ‚ÄúSpecial‚Äù](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-work-isnt-special)**

- Seth Larson
- It seems like security is special in a sense that we don‚Äôt want just anyone working on the security aspect of a project. We just want the trusted maintainers, right?
- Seth is arguing that this is the wrong mindset
- It makes more sense that we maybe have security experts contribute to many projects, and that someone working on security for just one project doesn‚Äôt benefit from scale.
  - ‚ÄúMaintainers don‚Äôt see how other projects are triaging vulnerabilities and can‚Äôt learn from each other. They can‚Äôt compare notes on what they are seeing and whether they are doing the right thing. Isolation in security work breeds a culture of fear. Fear of doing the wrong thing and making your users unsafe.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúThese ‚Äúsecurity contributors‚Äù could be maintainers or contributors of other open source projects that know about security, they could be foundations offering up resources to their ecosystem, or engineers at companies helping their dependency graph.‚Äù
- But how do we build trust in these individuals?
  - Meeting in person works.
  - But there are other ways as well.
- I‚Äôd personally love to have someone contact me about a project of mine regarding a security problem or process that the project could/should follow. Especially if I could see other projects I trust already trusting this individual to work on the other projects.
