**Michael #1:** [Solara UI Framework](https://solara.dev)

- via Florian
- A Pure Python, React-style Framework for Scaling Your Jupyter and Web Apps
- Solara lets you build web apps from pure Python using ipywidgets or a React-like API on top of ipywidgets. 
- These apps work both inside the Jupyter Notebook and as standalone web apps with frameworks like FastAPI.
- See the [Examples page](https://solara.dev/documentation/examples).
- Based on [Reacton](https://github.com/widgetti/reacton)
- By building on top of ipywidgets, Solara automatically leverage an existing ecosystem of widgets and run on many platforms, including JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Voilà, Google Colab, DataBricks, JetBrains Datalore, and more.

**Brian #2:** [**Coverage at a crossroads**](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202406/coverage_at_a_crossroads.html)

- Ned Batchelder is working on making coverage.py faster.
- Includes a nice, quick explanation of roughly how coverage.py works
  - with trace function and arcs used for branch coverage.
- And how trace slows things down for lines we know are already covered.
- There are cool ideas from [SlipCover](https://github.com/plasma-umass/slipcover) that could be applicable.
- There’s also sys.monitoring from Python 3.12 that helps with line coverage, since you can disable it for lines you already have info on.
  - It doesn’t quite complete the picture for branch coverage, though. 
- Summary:
  - jump in and help if you can
  - read it anyway for a great mental model of how coverage.py works.

**Michael #3:** [“Virtual”](https://fosstodon.org/@btskinn/109785696589422762)[ methods in Python classes](https://fosstodon.org/@btskinn/109785696589422762)

- via Brian Skinn
- [PEP 698](https://peps.python.org/pep-0698/) just got accepted, defining an @override decorator for type hinting, to help avoid errors in subclasses that override methods.
- Only affects type checkers but allows you to declare a “link” between the base method and derived class method with the intent of overriding it using OOP. If there is a mismatch, it’s an error.
- [Python 3.12’s documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.override)
- Makes Python [a bit more like C#](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/622132/what-are-virtual-methods) and other more formal languages

**Brian #4**: [Parsing Python ASTs 20x Faster with Rust](https://www.gauge.sh/blog/parsing-python-asts-20x-faster-with-rust)

- Evan Doyle
- [Tach](https://github.com/gauge-sh/tach) is “a CLI tool that lets you define and enforce import boundaries between Python modules in your project.”
  - we covered it in [episode 384](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/384/force-push-lightly)
- When used to analyze Sentry’s ~3k Python file codebase, it took about 10 seconds. 
- Profiling analysis using py-spy and speedscope pointed to a function that spends about 2/3 of the time parsing the AST, and about 1/3 traversing it.
- That portion was then rewritten in Rust, resulting in 10x speedup, ending in about 1 second.
- This is a cool example of not just throwing Rust at a speed problem right away, but doing the profiling homework first, and focusing the Rust rewrite on the bottleneck.

**Extras** 

Brian:

- I brought up pkgutil.resolve_name() last week on [episode 388](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/388/dont-delete-all-the-repos)
  - Brett Cannon says [don’t use that, it’s deprecated](https://fosstodon.org/@brettcannon/112663055336410268)
  - Thanks astroboy for letting me know
- Will we get CalVer for Python?
  - [it was talked about at the language summit](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/python-language-summit-2024-should-python-adopt-calver.html)
  - There’s also [pep 2026](https://peps.python.org/pep-2026/), in draft, with a nice nod in the number of when it might happen.
    - 3.13 already in the works for 2024
    - 3.14 slated for 2025, and we gotta have a pi release
    - So the earliest is then 2026, with maybe a 3.26 version ?
- [Saying thanks to open source maintainers](https://snarky.ca/saying-thanks-to-open-source-maintainers/)
  - Great write-up by Brett Cannon about how to show your appreciation for OSS maintainers.
    - Be nice
    - Be an advocate
    - Produce your own open source
    - Say thanks
    - Fiscal support
  - On topic
    - Thanks Brett for pyproject.toml. I love it.

Michael:

- The [Shiny for Python course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/reactive-web-dashboards-with-shiny-for-data-science) is out! Plus, it’s free so [come and get it](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/reactive-web-dashboards-with-shiny-for-data-science).
