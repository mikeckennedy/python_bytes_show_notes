- The [long discussion](https://lwn.net/Articles/802777/) on changing the Python project's release cadence has come to a conclusion: the project will now be releasing new versions on an annual basis.
- Described in PEP 602
- The steering council thinks that having a consistent schedule every year when
- we hit beta, RC, and final it will help the community:
	- Know when to start testing the beta to provide feedback
	- Known when the expect the RC so the community can prepare their projects for the final release
	- Know when the final release will occur to coordinate their own releases (if necessary) when the final release of Python occurs
	- Allow core developers to more easily plan their work to make sure work lands in the release they are targeting
	- Make sure that core developers and the community have a shorter amount of time to wait for new features to be released

**Michael #6**: [**lolcommits: selfies for software developers**](https://lolcommits.github.io/).

- **lolcommits** takes a snapshot with your webcam every time you git commit code, and archives a lolcat style image with it. **git blame** has never been so much fun.
- Infinite uses: Animate your progress through a project and watch as you age. See what you looked like when you broke the build. Keep a joint lolrepository for your entire company.
- Plugins: Lolcommits allows a growing list of [plugins](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits/wiki/Configuring-Plugins) to perform additional work on your lolcommit image after capturing.
- Animate: Configure lolcommits to generate an [animated GIF](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits#animated-gif-capturing) with each commit for extra lulz!
