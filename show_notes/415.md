**Michael #1:** [**dbos-transact-py**](https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-transact-py)

- DBOS Transact is a Python library providing **ultra-lightweight durable execution**.
- Durable execution means your program is **resilient to any failure**.
- If it is ever interrupted or crashes, all your workflows will automatically resume from the last completed step.
- Under the hood, DBOS Transact works by storing your program's execution state (which workflows are currently executing and which steps they've completed) in a Postgres database.
- Incredibly fast, for example [25x faster than AWS Step Functions](https://www.dbos.dev/blog/dbos-vs-aws-step-functions-benchmark).

**Brian #2:** [Typed Python in 2024: Well adopted, yet usability challenges persist](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/09/developer-tools/typed-python-2024-survey-meta/)

- Aaron Pollack on Engineering at Meta blog
- “Overall findings
  - 88% of respondents “Always” or “Often” use Types in their Python code.
  - IDE tooling, documentation, and catching bugs are drivers for the high adoption of types in survey responses,
  - The usability of types and ability to express complex patterns still are challenges that leave some code unchecked.
  - Latency in tooling and lack of types in popular libraries are limiting the effectiveness of type checkers.
  - Inconsistency in type check implementations and poor discoverability of the documentation create friction in onboarding types into a project and seeking help when using the tools. “
- Notes
  - Seems to be a different survey than the 2023 (current) dev survey. Diff time frame and results. July 29 - Oct 8, 2024

**Michael #3:** [RightTyper](https://github.com/RightTyper/RightTyper)

- A fast and efficient type assistant for Python, including tensor shape inference

**Brian #4:** [Lazy self-installing Python scripts with uv](https://treyhunner.com/2024/12/lazy-self-installing-python-scripts-with-uv/)

- Trey Hunner
- Creating your own ~/bin full of single-file command line scripts is common for *nix folks, still powerful but underutilized on Mac, and trickier but still useful on Windows.
- Python has been difficult in the past to use for standalone scripts if you need dependencies, but that’s no longer the case with uv.
- Trey walks through user scripts (*nix and Mac)
  - Using #! for scripts that don’thave dependencies
  - Using #!  with uv run --script and /// script for dependencies
  - Discussion about how uv handles that.
