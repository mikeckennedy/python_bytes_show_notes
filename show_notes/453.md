**Michael #1: [PyPI+](https://pypiplus.com)**

- Very nice search and exploration tool for PyPI
- Minor but annoying bug: content-types ‚â† content_types on PyPI+ but they are in Python itself. Minimum Python version seems to be interpreted as max Python version.
- See dependency graphs and more
- Examples
  - [content-types](https://pypiplus.com/project/content-types/0.3.0/)
  - [jinja-partials](https://pypiplus.com/project/jinja_partials/0.3.0/)
  - [fastapi-chameleon](https://pypiplus.com/project/fastapi_chameleon/0.1.17/)

**Brian #2: [uv-ship](https://github.com/floRaths/uv-ship) - a CLI-tool for shipping with uv**

- ‚Äú`uv-ship` is a lightweight companion to [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) that removes the risky parts of cutting a release. It verifies the repo state, bumps your project metadata and optionally refreshes the changelog. It then commits, tags & pushes the result, while giving you the chance to review every step.‚Äù

**Michael #3: [How fast is 3.14?](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/python-3-14-is-here-how-fast-is-it)**

- by Miguel Grinberg
- A big focus on threaded vs. non-threaded Python
- Some times its faster, other times, it‚Äôs slower

**Brian #4: [air - a new web framework built with FastAPI, Starlette, and Pydantic.](https://github.com/feldroy/air)**

- An very new project in Alpha stage by Daniel & Audrey Felderoy, the ‚ÄúTwo Scoops of Django‚Äù people.
- Air Tags are an interesting thing.
- Also [Why?](https://feldroy.github.io/air/why/) is amazing
  - ‚Äú**Don't use AIR‚Äù**
  - ‚ÄúEvery release could break your code! If you have to ask why you should use it, it's probably not for you.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúIf you want to use Air, you can. But we don't recommend it.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúIt'll likely infect you, your family, and your codebase with an evil web framework mind virus, , ‚Ä¶‚Äù

**Extras**

Brian:

- [Python 3.15a1 is available](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-15-alpha-1/104358?u=hugovk)

Michael:

- Blog post about the book: [Talk Python in Production book is out!](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/talk-python-in-production-book-is-out/) In particular, the extras are interesting.

- [Show me your ls](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/show-me-your-ls/)
- [Helium Browser](https://helium.computer) is interesting. But also has Python as a big role.
  - GitHub says Languages
    - **Python 97.4%     üëÄ**
    - Shell 1.9%
    - Other 0.7%
