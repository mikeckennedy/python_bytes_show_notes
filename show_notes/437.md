**Brian #2:** [Fixing Python Properties](https://willmcgugan.github.io/fixing-python-properties/)

- Will McGugan
- ‚ÄúPython properties work well with type checkers such Mypy and friends. ‚Ä¶ The type of your property is taken from the getter only. Even if your setter accepts different types, the type checker will complain on assignment.‚Äù
- Will describes a way to get around this and make type checkers happy.
- He replaces `@property` with a descriptor. It‚Äôs a cool technique.
- I also like the way Will is allowing different ways to use a property such that it‚Äôs more convenient for the user. This is a cool deverloper usability trick.

**SPONSOR SEGMENT: Posit Connect**

This episode of Python Bytes is brought to you by the folks at Posit.

Posit has made a huge investment in the Python community lately. Known originally for RStudio, they have been building out a suite of tools and services for team Python.

Today, I want to focus on hosting your Python-based data science workloads: This includes dashboards, reports, plots, interactive web apps, all the way to custom Flask and Django apps.

Their service is Posit Connect. Posit Connect makes it easy for data scientists to share work built with Python code. If you have a Streamlit app, Dash dashboard, Plotly interactive plots, a FastAPI service or even Quarto report, just give Posit Connect the code it needs to maintain the asset and Connect automatically does the rest. Connect will manage your APIs and serve your interactive apps.

And, if desired, update your reports and dashboards on a scheduled basis. That's right, no more need to explain to the stakeholders why that dashboard or plot stopped updating last week.

You get to focus on your data science and leveraging your skillset while Connect makes you look good, keeping your code running and private. With Connect, you get a private URL on your Connect server, ensuring that your asset is continuously available to your shareholders. You can control which users have access to the asset.

Let Posit Connect handle the delivery and DevOps involved in sharing your work. You focus on what you do best.

So if you work on a data science team, you owe it to you and your org to check out Posit Connect. Visit [pythonbytes.fm/connect](http://talkpython.fm/connect) today and get a 3 month free trial to see if it‚Äôs a good fit. That‚Äôs [pythonbytes.fm/connect](http://talkpython.fm/connect). The link is in your podcast player‚Äôs show notes.

Thank you to Posit for supporting Python Bytes.

**Brian #3: [complexipy](https://github.com/rohaquinlop/complexipy)**

- Calculates the cognitive complexity of Python files, written in Rust.
- Based on the cognitive complexity measurement described in a white paper by Sonar
- Cognitive complexity builds on the idea of cyclomatic complexity.
- Cyclomatic complexity was intended to measure the ‚Äútestability and maintainability‚Äù of the control flow of a module. Sonar argues that it‚Äôs fine for testability, but doesn‚Äôt do well with measuring the ‚Äúmaintainability‚Äù part. So they came up with a new measure.
- Cognitive complexity is intended to reflects the relative difficulty of understanding, and therefore of maintaining methods, classes, and applications.
- complexipy essentially does that, but also has a really nice color output.
- Note: at the very least, you should be using ‚Äúcyclomatic complexity‚Äù
  - try with `ruff check --select C901`
- But also try complexipy.
- Great for understanding which functions might be ripe for refactoring, adding more documentation, surrounding with more tests, etc.

**Michael #4: [juvio](https://github.com/OKUA1/juvio)**

- uv kernel for Jupyter
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Automatic Environment Setup:** When the notebook is opened, Juvio installs the dependencies automatically in an ephemeral virtual environment (using `uv`), ensuring that the notebook runs with the correct versions of the packages and Python
- üìÅ **Git-Friendly Format:** Notebooks are converted on the fly to a script-style format using `# %%` markers, making diffs and version control painless
- Why Use Juvio?
  - No additional lock or requirements files are needed
  - Guaranteed reproducibility
  - Cleaner Git diffs
- Powered By
  - `uv` ‚Äì ultra-fast Python package management
  - `PEP 723` ‚Äì Python inline dependency standards
