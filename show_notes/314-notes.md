**Brian #1:** [**FAQtory**](https://github.com/willmcgugan/faqtory)

- Will McGugan
- ‚ÄúFAQtory is a tool to auto-generate a [FAQ.md](https://github.com/willmcgugan/faqtory/blob/main/FAQ.md) (Frequently Asked Questions) document for your project.
- FAQtory has a FAQ.md written by itself, so you can see an example of the project in the project.
- Builds a markdown FAQ.md that includes questions at the top that link to answers below.
- ‚ÄúAdditionally, a ‚Äòsuggest‚Äô feature uses fuzzy matching to reply to GitHub issues with suggestions from your FAQ.‚Äù
    - I haven‚Äôt tried this part, but looking forward to it. 
    - May help to answer GH issues that are really questions.

**Michael #2:**  [**Kagi search "live with it‚Äù report**](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/paying-for-search-in-2022-am-i-crazy/)

- Still enjoying it a lot
- Very fast
- LOVE blocking SEO-heavy, content-light sites
- Maps are rough around the edges
- Not obvious how to set as a private/incognito search engine (but can be done in settings)
- They have browser extensions - but I don't want to install extensions
    - I only use 1password & zoom
- It could use some documentation however (e.g. supports !‚Äôs, but what are they?)
- Being tempted by Orion too, but sticking with Vivaldi.

**Brian #3:** [**Tools for rewriting Python code**](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/tools-for-rewriting-python-code/)

- Luke Plant
- A collection of tools change your code (hopefully for the better)
- Several categories
    - formatting and coding style - black, isort, ‚Ä¶
    - upgrades - pyupgrade, flynt, ‚Ä¶
        - we need one to convert from setup.py/setup.cfg to pyproject.toml
    - type hints - auto type hints? cool. maybe. 
        - I haven‚Äôt tried any of these, but they look interesting
    - refactoring, editors, rope, jedi 
    - other - autoflake, shed, ‚Ä¶
    - write your own, with [LibCST](https://libcst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

**Michael #4:** [**Socketify**](https://github.com/cirospaciari/socketify.py)

- Bringing WebSockets, Http/Https High Performance servers for PyPy3 and Python3
- [**A new record**](https://fosstodon.org/@cirospaciari/109478126464572966) for Python no other Web Framework as able to reach 6.2 mi requests per second before in @TFBenchmarks ü•á üèÜ 
- This puts Python in the same ballpark than #golang, #Rust and #C++.

**Extras** 

Brian:

- watching [mousebender](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender) from Brett Cannon
    - BTW, releases watching is cool. Probably a decent reason to use GH releases feature.
- Python Developer‚Äôs Guide has a visual of the  [Python Versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) and release cycle.
    - Shows the stages of releases: end-of-life, security, bugfix, feature
    - Next end-of-life is Python 3.7 on 27-June-2023
    - [Great descriptions of what all these terms mean](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#status-key) at the bottom
