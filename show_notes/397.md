**Michael #1:** [pyawaitable](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pyawaitable)

- CPython API for asynchronous functions.
- by Peter Bierma
- It was originally designed to be directly part of CPython - you can read the [scrapped PEP](https://gist.github.com/ZeroIntensity/8d32e94b243529c7e1c27349e972d926) about it. 
- Since this library only uses the public ABI, it's better fit outside of CPython, as a library.

**Brian #2:** [Annotated area charts with plotnine](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/plotnine-annotated-area-chart/)

- Nicola Rennie
- This is a marvelous, very professional looking plot, and a tutorial for how to achieve it.
- Uses [plotline](https://plotnine.org), which is “.. an implementation of a *grammar of graphics* in Python based on ggplot2”
  - I actually didn’t know the gg in ggplot came from “grammar of graphics”. TIL

**Michael #3:** [DeltaDB](https://github.com/uname-n/deltabase)

- A lightweight, comprehensive solution for managing delta tables built on polars and deltalake.
- [Deltalake](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs): Delta Lake is an open-source storage format that runs on top of existing data lakes. 
- [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars): Dataframes powered by a multithreaded, vectorized query engine, written in Rust (aka fluent, rust-based pandas)
- See [the docs](https://uname-n.github.io/deltabase/).

**Brian #4:** [PyCon US 2024 Recap + Videos are up](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2024/08/pycon-us-2024-recap-and-recording.html)

- 95 countries attended
- total attendance of 2,991
  - 2,551 in person
  - 440 remote
- Videos available [PyConUS](https://www.youtube.com/@PyConUS) 
  - I recommend [Playlist → 2024 → view full playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Uw4_HvXqvYhjub9bw4uDAmNtprgAvlJ), as it’s easier to see the talk titles.
  - I’ve got Paul Gannsle’s pytest for unittesters and Amitosh Swain’s Testing Data Pipelines queued up

**Extras** 

Brian:

- [Hello, pytest!](https://courses.pythontest.com/hello-pytest) course available as of last Friday.
  - Now the fastest way to get started using pytest. 
  - 16 lessons (really 12 + intro, outro, code download, pytest flag cheat sheet)
  - The whole shebang is about 90 min. (faster if you bump up the video speed. :)

Michael:

- Cutting back on digital distractions, trying [Dumb Phone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dumb-phone/id6504743503) for iPhone.
  - See [screenshot](https://python-bytes-static.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dumb-phone-experiment.jpeg)

**Joke:** [The Tao of Programming: 4.3](https://www.talisman.org/tao/)

A master was explaining the nature of Tao of to one of his novices, "The Tao is embodied in all software -- regardless of how insignificant," said the master.

"Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?" asked the novice.

"It is," came the reply.

"Is the Tao in a video game?" continued the novice.

"It is even in a video game," said the master.

"And is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer?"

The master coughed and shifted his position slightly. "The lesson is over for today," he said.
