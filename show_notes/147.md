**Brian #1:** [**rapidtables**](https://github.com/alttch/rapidtables)

- ‚Äú**rapidtables ‚Ä¶** converts lists of dictionaries to pre-formatted tables. And it does the job as fast as possible.‚Äù
- Also can do color formatting if used in conjunction with `termcolor.colored`, but I‚Äôm mostly excited about really easily generating tabular data with `print`.
- Can also format to markdown or reStructured text, and can do alignment, ‚Ä¶ 

**Michael #2**: [**httpx**](https://github.com/encode/httpx)

- A next generation HTTP client for Python. ü¶ã
- HTTPX builds on the well-established usability of `requests`, and gives you:
	- A requests-compatible API.
	- HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 support.
	- Support for [issuing HTTP requests in parallel](https://www.encode.io/httpx/parallel/). *(Coming soon)*
	- Standard synchronous interface, but [with](https://www.encode.io/httpx/async/) `[async](https://www.encode.io/httpx/async/)`[/](https://www.encode.io/httpx/async/)`[await](https://www.encode.io/httpx/async/)` [support if you need it](https://www.encode.io/httpx/async/).
	- Ability to [make requests directly to WSGI or ASGI applications](https://www.encode.io/httpx/advanced/#calling-into-python-web-apps).
		- This is particularly useful for two main use-cases:
			- Using `httpx` as a client, inside test cases.
			- Mocking out external services, during tests or in dev/staging environments.
	- Strict timeouts everywhere.
	- Fully type annotated.
	- 100% test coverage.
- Lovely support for ‚Äú[parallel requests](https://www.encode.io/httpx/parallel/)‚Äù without full `asyncio` (at the API level).
	- Also pairs with async / await with async client.
- Plus all the requests features

**Brian #3:** [**Quick and dirty mock service with Starlette**](https://www.mattlayman.com/blog/2019/starlette-mock-service/)

- Matt Layman
- Mock out / fake a third party service in a testing environment.
- Starlette looks fun, but the process can be used with other API producing server packages.
- We tell people to do things like this all the time, but there are few examples showing how to.
- This example also introduces a delay because the service used in production takes over a minute and part of the testing is to make sure the system under test handles that delay gracefully.
- Very cool, easy to follow write up. (Should probably have Matt on a [Test & Code](https://testandcode.com) episode to talk about this strategy.)

**Michael #4:** [**Mocking out AWS APIs**](https://github.com/spulec/moto)

- via Giuseppe Cunsolo
- A library that allows you to easily mock out tests based on AWS infrastructure.
- Lovely use of a decorator to mock out S3
- Moto isn't just for Python code and it isn't just for S3. Look at the [standalone server mode](https://github.com/spulec/moto#stand-alone-server-mode) for more information about running Moto with other languages.
- Be sure to check out [very important note](https://github.com/spulec/moto#very-important----recommended-usage).

**Brian #5**: [**ŒºMongo: sync/async ODM**](https://github.com/Scille/uMongo)

- ‚ÄúŒºMongo is a Python MongoDB ODM. It inception comes from two needs: the lack of async ODM and the difficulty to do document (un)serialization with existing ODMs.‚Äù
- works with common mongo drivers such as PyMongo, TxMongo, motor_asyncio, and mongomock. (Hadn‚Äôt heard of [mongomock](https://github.com/vmalloc/mongomock) before, I‚Äôll have to try that out.)
- Note: We‚Äôve discussed [MongoEngine](https://github.com/MongoEngine/mongoengine) before. (I‚Äôm curious what Michael has to say about uMongo.)
    

**Michael #6:** [**Single Responsibility Principle**](https://sobolevn.me/2019/03/enforcing-srp) [**in Python**](https://sobolevn.me/2019/03/enforcing-srp)

- via Tyler Matteson
- I‚Äôm a big fan of the [SOLID principles](https://itnext.io/solid-principles-explanation-and-examples-715b975dcad4)
- They even come in demotivator style posters

Anti-joke (we ready for those yet?): A Python developer, a PHP developer, a C# developer, and a Go developer went to lunch together.  They had a nice lunch and got along fine.
