**Michael #1:** [**mpire**](https://github.com/sybrenjansen/mpire)

- A Python package for easy multiprocessing, but faster than multiprocessing
- `MPIRE` is faster in most scenarios, packs more features, and is generally more user-friendly than the default multiprocessing package.
- Tons of [features](https://github.com/sybrenjansen/mpire#features).
- [Nice intro article](https://towardsdatascience.com/mpire-for-python-multiprocessing-is-really-easy-d2ae7999a3e9) with benchmarks.

**Brian #2:** [**mopup**](https://pypi.org/project/mopup/) - the macOS Python.org Updater

- Glyph Lefkowitz
- On a mac, install Python with the standard Python.org installer.
- Then, periodically, update with `python3 -m mopup` 
- I just did it and went from Python 3.11.4 to 3.11.5
- See also [Get Your Mac Python From Python.org for reasons to use python.org](https://blog.glyph.im/2023/08/get-your-mac-python-from-python-dot-org.html) over other ways, also from Glyph.


**Michael #3:** [**Immortal Objects for Python**](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/08/15/developer-tools/immortal-objects-for-python-instagram-meta/)

- Instagram has introduced Immortal Objects – [PEP-683](https://peps.python.org/pep-0683/) – to Python. 

**Brian #4:** [**Common Docstring Formats in Python**](https://stackabuse.com/common-docstring-formats-in-python/)

- Scott Robinson
- I don’t mean to disrespect Scott, but I’m honestly curious if this is really common.
- I like docstrings for the “why” of a function. And prefer type hints for types.
- Let me know what you use, at [@brianokken@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@brianokken)
