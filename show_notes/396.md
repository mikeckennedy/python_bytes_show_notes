**Brian #1:** [**uv venv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/0.2.35/docs/concepts/python-versions.md)[ ](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/0.2.35/docs/concepts/python-versions.md)[**--python**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/0.2.35/docs/concepts/python-versions.md)[ **& uv python**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/0.2.35/docs/concepts/python-versions.md)

- I was reading this article [Python Packaging is Great Now:](https://dev.to/astrojuanlu/python-packaging-is-great-now-uv-is-all-you-need-4i2d)[ ](https://dev.to/astrojuanlu/python-packaging-is-great-now-uv-is-all-you-need-4i2d?utm_source=pocket_shared)[`uv`](https://dev.to/astrojuanlu/python-packaging-is-great-now-uv-is-all-you-need-4i2d?utm_source=pocket_shared)[ is all you need](https://dev.to/astrojuanlu/python-packaging-is-great-now-uv-is-all-you-need-4i2d?utm_source=pocket_shared)
- It’s a little too “look, a silver bullet” for me, but it did point out some cool uv stuff I didn’t know about.
  - uv venv venv --python 3.12  creates a virtual environment with Python 3.12, 
    - even if you didn’t have 3.12 installed on your system already.
    - If it doesn’t work, try adding --python-preference managed
  - uv python list shows all the python versions on your computer
  - There’s quite a few “experimental features”
    -  **run**    Run a command or script (experimental)
    -  **init**   Create a new project (experimental)
    -  **add**    Add dependencies to the project (experimental)
    -  **remove**  Remove dependencies from the project (experimental)
    -  **sync**   Update the project's environment (experimental)
    -  **lock**   Update the project's lockfile (experimental)
    -  **tree**   Display the project's dependency tree (experimental)
    -  **tool**   Run and manage tools provided by Python packages (experimental)
    -  **python**  Manage Python versions and installations (experimental)
- uv add --dev pytest will add pytest to your dev dependencies.
- uv tree  rocks
- uv might not have “solved packaging” (or maybe it might have)
  - but it sure is fun to watch the experimentation of different workflows.

**Michael #2:** [Python 3.12.5 released](https://docs.python.org/release/3.12.5/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-12-5)

- Lots of changes, see the [release notes](https://docs.python.org/release/3.12.5/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-12-5)

**Brian #3:** [Compile and use dependencies for multiple Python versions in Tox](https://blog.rxbc.se/posts/compile-and-use-dependencies-for-multiple-python-versions-in-tox/)

- Viktor Rimark
- Cool idea to use the {envname}, which specifies the tox environment, in the name of a requirements-dev.txt file name.
- Then add a requirements tox target to generate pip-compile-ed files.
- Now I gotta try doing all of this with uv lock
- Then we need everyone to mod their tools to comply with [PEP 571](https://peps.python.org/pep-0751/), when/if it’s adopted (covered it last week)

**Michael #4:** [Catalog of Dark Patterns](https://hallofshame.design/collection/)
