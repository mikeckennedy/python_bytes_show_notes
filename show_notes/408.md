**Brian #1:** [GitHub action security: zizmor](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202410/github_action_security_zizmor.html)

- Article: Ned Batchelder  
- zizmor: William Woodruff & others
- “a new tool to check your GitHub action workflows for security concerns.”
- Install with cargo or brew, then point it at workflow yml files.
- It reports security concerns.

**Michael #2:** [**Python is now the top language on GitHub**](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/)

- Thanks to Pat Decker for the heads up.
- A rapidly growing number of developers worldwide
  - This suggests AI isn’t just helping more people learn to write code or build software faster—it’s also attracting and helping more people become developers. First-time open source contributors continue to show wide-scale interest in AI projects. But we aren’t seeing signs that AI has hurt open source with low-quality contributions.
- Python is now the most used language on GitHub as global open source activity continues to extend beyond traditional software development.
  - The rise in Python usage correlates with large communities of people joining the open source community from across the STEM world rather than the traditional community of software developers.
- There’s a continued increase in first-time contributors to open source projects. 1.4 million new developers globally joined open source with a majority contributing to commercially backed and generative AI projects. 
  - Notably, we did not see a rise in rejected pull requests. This could indicate that quality remains high despite the influx of new contributors.

**Brian #3:** [Python 3.13, what didn't make the headlines](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/python-313-what-didnt-make-the-headlines)

- Some pretty cool updates to pdb : the command line Python debugger
  - multiline editing
  - code completion 
- pathlib has a bunch of performance updates
- python -m venv adds a .gitignore file that auto ignores the venv.
