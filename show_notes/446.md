**Brian #1: [pypistats.org](http://pypistats.org) was down, is now back, and there‚Äôs a CLI**

- [pypistats.org](https://pypistats.org) is a cool site to check the download stats for Python packages.

- It was [down for a while](https://github.com/psf/pypistats.org/issues/82), like 3 weeks?

- A couple days ago, [Hugo van Kemenade announced that it was back up](https://fosstodon.org/@hugovk@mastodon.social/115074427645537464).

- With some changes in stewardship

  - ‚Äú[pypistats.org](http://pypistats.org/) is back online! üöÄüìà

    Thanks to @jezdez for suggesting the @ThePSF takes stewardship and connecting the right people, to @EWDurbin for migrating, and of course to Christopher Flynn for creating and running it for all these years!‚Äù

- Hugo has a CLI version, [pypistats](https://github.com/hugovk/pypistats)

  - You can give it a command for what you want to search for
    - recent,overall, python_major, python_minor, system
  - Then either a package name, a directory path, or if nothing, it will grab the current directory package via pyproject.toml or setup.cfg
  - very cool

**Michael #2: [State of Python 2025](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/08/the-state-of-python-2025/)**

- **Michael‚Äôs Themes**
  - Python people use Python: 86% of respondents use Python as their main language
  - We are mostly brand-new programmers: Exactly 50% of respondents have less than two years of professional coding experience
  - Data science is now over half of all Python
  - Most still use older Python versions despite benefits of newer releases: [Compelling math to make the change](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/08/the-state-of-python-2025/#most-still-use-older-python-versions-despite-benefits-of-newer-releases).
  - Python web devs resurgence
- **Forward-looking trends**
  - Agentic AI will be wild
  - Async, await, and threading are becoming core to Python
  - Python GUIs and mobile are rising
- **Actionable ideas**
  - Action 1: Learn uv
  - Action 2: Use the latest Python
  - Action 3: Learn agentic AI
  - Action 4: Learn to read basic Rust
  - Action 5: Invest in understanding threading
  - Action 6: Remember the newbies

**Brian #3: [wrapt: A Python module for decorators, wrappers and monkey patching.](https://wrapt.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html)**

- ‚ÄúThe aim of the **wrapt** module is to provide a transparent object proxy for Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function wrappers and decorator functions.

  An easy to use decorator factory is provided to make it simple to create your own decorators that will behave correctly in any situation they may be used.‚Äù

- Why not just use `functools.wraps()`?

  - ‚ÄúThe **wrapt** module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way beyond existing mechanisms such as `functools.wraps()` to ensure that decorators preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent behaviour.‚Äù

- There‚Äôs a [bunch of blog posts](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/tree/master/blog) from 2014 / 2015 (and kept updated) that talk about how wrapt solves many issues with traditional ways to decorate and patch things in Python, including [‚ÄúHow you implemented your Python decorator is wrong‚Äù](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/blob/master/blog/01-how-you-implemented-your-python-decorator-is-wrong.md).

- [Docs](https://wrapt.readthedocs.io/en/latest) are pretty good, with everything from simple wrappers to an example of building a wrapper to handle [thread synchronization](https://wrapt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#thread-synchronization)

**Michael #4:** [pysentry](https://pysentry.com)

- via [Owen Lamont](https://bsky.app/profile/owen7ba.bsky.social/post/3lwojcl4ycs2a)

- Install via `uv tool install pysentry-rs`

- Scan your Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities with Rust-powered scanner.

- PySentry audits Python projects for known security vulnerabilities by analyzing dependency files (`uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile`, `requirements.txt`) and cross-referencing them against multiple vulnerability databases. It provides comprehensive reporting with support for various output formats and filtering options.

- **Key Features**:

  - **Multiple Project Formats**: Supports `uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile`, and `requirements.txt` files

  - **External Resolver Integration**: Leverages `uv` and `pip-tools` for accurate requirements.txt constraint solving

  - **Multiple Data Sources**:

    - PyPA Advisory Database (default)
    - PyPI JSON API
    - OSV.dev (Open Source Vulnerabilities)

  - **Flexible Output for different workflows**: Human-readable, JSON, SARIF, and Markdown formats

  - **Performance Focused**:

    - Written in Rust for speed
    - Async/concurrent processing
    - Multi-tier intelligent caching (vulnerability data + resolved dependencies)

  - **Comprehensive Filtering**:

    - Severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)
    - Dependency scopes (main only vs all [optional, dev, prod, etc] dependencies)
    - Direct vs. transitive dependencies

  - **Enterprise Ready**: SARIF output for IDE/CI integration

  - I tried it on [pythonbytes.fm](http://pythonbytes.fm) and found only one issue, sadly can‚Äôt be fixed:

    ```bash
    PYSENTRY SECURITY AUDIT
    =======================
    
    SUMMARY: 89 packages scanned ‚Ä¢ 1 vulnerable ‚Ä¢ 1 vulnerabilities found
    
    SEVERITY:  1 LOW
    
    UNFIXABLE: 1 vulnerabilities cannot be fixed
    
    VULNERABILITIES
    ---------------
    
     1. PYSEC-2022-43059  aiohttp v3.12.15  [LOW] [source: pypa-zip]
        AIOHTTP 3.8.1 can report a "ValueError: Invalid IPv6 URL" outcome, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). NOTE:...

    ```
