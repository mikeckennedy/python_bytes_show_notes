**Michael #1:** [**jiter**](https://github.com/pydantic/jiter)

- Fast iterable JSON parser.
- About to be the backend for Pydantic and Logfire. 
- Currently powers OpenAI / ChatGPT (along with Pydantic itself), at least their Python library, maybe more.
- jiter has three interfaces:
  - JsonValue an enum representing JSON data
  - Jiter an iterator over JSON data
  - PythonParse which parses a JSON string into a Python object
- [jiter-python](https://github.com/pydantic/jiter/tree/main/crates/jiter-python) - This is a standalone version of the JSON parser used in pydantic-core. The recommendation is to only use this package directly if you do not use pydantic

**Brian #2:** [A new home for python-build-standalone](https://astral.sh/blog/python-build-standalone)

- Charlie Marsh
- See also [Transferring Python Build Standalone Stewardship to Astral](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2024/12/03/transferring-python-build-standalone-stewardship-to-astral/) from Gregory Szorc
- python-build-standalone is the project that has prebuilt binaries for different architectures.
- used by uv python install 3.12  and uv venv .venv --python 3.12 and uv sync
- This is good stability news for everyone.
- Interesting discussion of [prebuilt Python from Charlie](https://bsky.app/profile/crmarsh.com/post/3lch35lrdi224)

**Michael #3:** [moka-py](https://github.com/deliro/moka-py)

- A high performance caching library for Python written in Rust
- **moka-py** is a Python binding for the highly efficient [Moka](https://github.com/moka-rs/moka) caching library written in Rust. 
- This library allows you to leverage the power of Moka's high-performance, feature-rich cache in your Python projects.
-  Features
  - **Synchronous Cache:** Supports thread-safe, in-memory caching for Python applications.
  - **TTL Support:** Automatically evicts entries after a configurable time-to-live (TTL).
  - **TTI Support:** Automatically evicts entries after a configurable time-to-idle (TTI).
  - **Size-based Eviction:** Automatically removes items when the cache exceeds its size limit using the TinyLFU policy.
  - **Concurrency:** Optimized for high-performance, concurrent access in multi-threaded environments.

**Brian #4:** [**uv: An In-Depth Guide**](https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/uv/)

- On SaaS Pegasus blog, so presumably by Cory Zue
- Good intro to uv
- Also a nice list of everyday commands
  - Install python: uv python install 3.12
    - I don’t really use this anymore, as uv venv .venv --python 3.12 or uv sync install if necessary
  - create a virtual env:  uv venv .venv --python 3.12
  - install stuff: uv pip install django
  - add project dependencies
  - build pinned dependencies
- Also discussion about adopting the new workflow
