**Michael #1:** [Talk Python rewritten in Quart](https://talkpython.fm/blog/posts/talk-python-rewritten-in-quart-async-flask/)[ ](https://talkpython.fm/blog/posts/talk-python-rewritten-in-quart-async-flask/)[(async](https://talkpython.fm/blog/posts/talk-python-rewritten-in-quart-async-flask/)[ Flask)](https://talkpython.fm/blog/posts/talk-python-rewritten-in-quart-async-flask/)

- Rewrote all of [talkpython.fm](https://talkpython.fm/) in [Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/) (10k lines of code total, 4k changed)
- Considered 
  - FastAPI
  - Litestar
  - Django
  - Hugo Static Site + Python
  - Flask
- Discussed the multistage upgrade / conversion process
- Automating tests for all 1,000 pages

**Brian #2:** [PyPI now supports digital attestations](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-11-14-pypi-now-supports-digital-attestations/)

- Dustin Ingram
- “**Attestations provide a verifiable link to an upstream source repository:** By signing with the identity of the upstream source repository, such as in the case of an upload of a project built with GitHub Actions, PyPI's support for digital attestations defines a strong and verifiable association between a file on PyPI and the source repository, workflow, and even the commit hash that produced and uploaded the file. Additionally, publishing attestations to a transparency log helps mitigate against both compromise of PyPI and compromise of the projects themselves.”
- For maintainers
  - If using GH Actions and Trusted Publishing
    - make sure you use pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish, version v1.11.0 or newer
    - that’s it
  - If not
    - “Support for automatic attestation generation and publication from other Trusted Publisher environments [is planned](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/17001).”
    - “While not recommended, maintainers can also [manually](https://docs.pypi.org/attestations/producing-attestations/#the-manual-way) [generate and publish attestations](https://docs.pypi.org/attestations/producing-attestations/#the-manual-way).”

**Michael #3:** [Django Rusty Templates](https://github.com/LilyFoote/django-rusty-templates)

- by Lily Foote
- An experimental reimplementation of Django's templating language in Rust.
- Goals
  - 100% compatibility of rendered output.
  - Error reporting that is at least as useful as Django's errors.
  - Improved performance over Django's pure Python implementation.

**Brian #4:** [**PEP 639 is now supported by PYPI**](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-639-round-3-improving-license-clarity-with-better-package-metadata/53020/128)

- [from Brett Cannon](https://bsky.app/profile/snarky.ca/post/3laudpvnabc27)
- [PEP 639 – Improving License Clarity with Better Package Metadata](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/)
- For project metadata, use these fields: license and license-files:
- Examples license field

```toml
[project]
license = "MIT"

[project]
license = "MIT AND (Apache-2.0 OR BSD-2-clause)"

[project]
license = "MIT OR GPL-2.0-or-later OR (FSFUL AND BSD-2-Clause)"

[project]
license = "LicenseRef-Proprietary"
```

- Examples of `license-files`:
```toml
[project]
  license-files = ["LICEN[CS]E*", "AUTHORS*"]

  [project]
  license-files = ["licenses/LICENSE.MIT", "licenses/LICENSE.CC0"]

  [project]
  license-files = ["LICENSE.txt", "licenses/*"]

  [project]
  license-files = []
```
