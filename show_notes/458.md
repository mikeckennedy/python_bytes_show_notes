**Brian #1: Possibility of a new website for Django**

- Current Django site: [djangoproject.com](https://www.djangoproject.com)
- Adam Hill’s in progress redesign idea: [django-homepage.adamghill.com](https://django-homepage.adamghill.com)
- Commentary in the [Want to work on a homepage site redesign? discussion](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/want-to-work-on-a-homepage-site-redesign/42909/35)

**Michael #2: [aiosqlitepool](https://github.com/slaily/aiosqlitepool)**

- 🛡️A resilient, high-performance asynchronous connection pool layer for SQLite, designed for efficient and scalable database operations.
- About 2x better than regular SQLite.
- Pairs with [aiosqlite](https://github.com/omnilib/aiosqlite)
- `aiosqlitepool` in three points:
  - **Eliminates connection overhead**: It avoids repeated database connection setup (syscalls, memory allocation) and teardown (syscalls, deallocation) by reusing long-lived connections.
  - **Faster queries via "hot" cache**: Long-lived connections keep SQLite's in-memory page cache "hot." This serves frequently requested data directly from memory, speeding up repetitive queries and reducing I/O operations.
  - **Maximizes concurrent throughput**: Allows your application to process significantly more database queries per second under heavy load.

**Brian #3: [deptry](https://deptry.com)**

- “deptry is a command line tool to check for issues with dependencies in a Python project, such as unused or missing dependencies. It supports projects using Poetry, pip, PDM, uv, and more generally any project supporting PEP 621 specification.”
- “Dependency issues are detected by scanning for imported modules within all Python files in a directory and its subdirectories, and comparing those to the dependencies listed in the project's requirements.”
- Note if you use `project.optional-dependencies`

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
plot = ["matplotlib"]
test = ["pytest"]
```

- you have to set a config setting to get it to work right:

```toml
[tool.deptry]
pep621_dev_dependency_groups = ["test", "docs"]
```

**Michael #4: [browsr](https://github.com/juftin/browsr)**

- **`browsr`** 🗂️ is a pleasant **file explorer** in your terminal. It's a command line **TUI** (text-based user interface) application that empowers you to browse the contents of local and remote filesystems with your keyboard or mouse.
- You can quickly navigate through directories and peek at files whether they're hosted **locally**, in **GitHub**, over **SSH**, in **AWS S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, or **Azure Blob Storage**.
- View code files with syntax highlighting, format JSON files, render images, convert data files to navigable datatables, and more.

**Extras**

Brian:

- Understanding the MICRO
- TDD chapter coming out later today or maybe tomorrow, but it’s close.

Michael:

- [Peacock](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock) is excellent
