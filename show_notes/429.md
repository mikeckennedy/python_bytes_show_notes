**Brian #2:**  [**CVE Foundation**](https://www.thecvefoundation.org/) formed to take over CVE program from MITRE

- Back story: [CVE, global source of cybersecurity info, was hours from being cut by DHS](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/crucial-cve-flaw-tracking-database-narrowly-avoids-closure-to-dhs-cuts/)
  - The 25-year-old CVE program, an essential part of global cybersecurity, is cited in nearly any discussion or response to a computer security issue.
  - CVE was at real risk of closure after its contract was set to expire on April 16.
  - The nonprofit MITRE runs CVE on a contract with the DHS.
  - A letter last Tuesday sent Tuesday by Yosry Barsoum, vice president of MITRE, gave notice of the potential halt to operations.
  - Another possible victim of the current administration.
- [CVE Foundation Launched to Secure the Future of the CVE Program](https://www.thecvefoundation.org/)
  - CVE Board members have spent the past year developing a strategy to transition CVE to a dedicated, non-profit foundation. The new CVE Foundation will focus solely on continuing the mission of delivering high-quality vulnerability identification and maintaining the integrity and availability of CVE data for defenders worldwide.
  - Over the coming days, the Foundation will release more information about its structure, transition planning, and opportunities for involvement from the broader community.
