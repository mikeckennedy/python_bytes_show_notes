**Brian #1:** [The weird quirk with rounding in Python](https://itnext.io/the-weird-quirk-with-rounding-in-python-e6cd98cb3d55)

- Tom Nijhof-Verheesb
- With numbers ending in .5, Python always rounds to an even number.
  - round(0.5) → 0
  - round(1.5) → 2
  - etc
- This follows IEEE 754
- You can use decimal if you need a different behavior.

**Michael #2:** [Python interpreter adds tail calls](https://lwn.net/Articles/1010905/)

- Ken Jin, a member of the project, has merged a [new set of changes](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128563) that have been [benchmarked](https://gist.github.com/Fidget-Spinner/497c664eef389622d146d632990b0d21) as improving performance by 10% for some architectures.
- "Speedup is roughly equal to 2 minor CPython releases worth of improvements. For example, CPython 3.12 roughly sped up by 5%.”

**Brian #3:** [**Remove punctuation from a string with translate and maketrans**](https://bsky.app/profile/mathspp.com/post/3lkgp2vplzk2f)

- Rodrigo
- “Don't use the method `replace` to remove punctuation from a Python string. Instead, use the method `translate`.”
