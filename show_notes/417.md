**Michael #1:** [LLM Catcher](https://github.com/d4v3y0rk/llm_catcher)

- via Pat Decker
- Large language model diagnostics for python applications and FastAPI applications .
- Features
  - Exception diagnosis using LLMs (Ollama or OpenAI)
  - Support for local LLMs through Ollama
  - OpenAI integration for cloud-based models
  - Multiple error handling approaches:
    - Function decorators for automatic diagnosis
    - Try/except blocks for manual control
    - Global exception handler for unhandled errors from imported modules
  - Both synchronous and asynchronous APIs
  - Flexible configuration through environment variables or config file

**Brian #2:**  On PyPI Quarantine process

- Mike Fiedler
- [Project Lifecycle Status - Quarantine](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-08-16-safety-and-security-engineer-year-in-review/#project-lifecycle-status-quarantine) in his "Safety & Security Engineer: First Year in Review post” 
- Some more info now in [Project Quarantine](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-12-30-quarantine/)
- Reports of malware in a project kick things off
- Admins can now place a project in quarantine, allowing it to be unavailable for install, but still around for analysis.
- New process allows for packages to go back to normal if the report is false.
- However
  - Since August, the Quarantine feature has been in use, with PyPI Admins marking ~140 reported projects as Quarantined.
  - Of these, **only a single project** has exited Quarantine, others have been removed.

**Michael #3:**  [RESPX](https://github.com/lundberg/respx)

- Mock HTTPX with awesome request patterns and response side effects ![butterfly](https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/1f98b.png?version=8.0.0)
- A simple, *yet powerful*, utility for mocking out the [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/), *and* [*HTTP Core*](https://www.encode.io/httpcore/), libraries.
- Start by [patching](https://lundberg.github.io/respx/guide/#mock-httpx) HTTPX, using respx.mock, then add request [routes](https://lundberg.github.io/respx/guide/#routing-requests) to mock [responses](https://lundberg.github.io/respx/guide/#mocking-responses).
- For a neater pytest experience, RESPX includes a respx_mock *fixture*

**Brian #4:** [Unpacking kwargs with custom objects](https://mathspp.com/blog/til/unpacking-kwargs-with-custom-objects)

- Rodrigo
- A class needs to have 
  - a keys() method that returns an iterable.
  - a __getitem__() method for lookup
- Then double splat ** works on objects of that type.

**Extras** 

Brian:

- [A surprising thing about PyPI's BigQuery data](https://hugovk.dev/blog/2024/a-surprising-thing-about-pypis-bigquery-data) - Hugovk
  - [Top PyPI Packages](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/)[ ](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/)(and therefore also [Top pytest Plugins](https://pythontest.com/top-pytest-plugins/)) uses a BigQuery dataset
  - Has grabbed 30-day data of 4,000, then 5,000, then 8,000 packages.
  - Turns out 531,022 packages (amount returned when limit set to a million) is the same cost.
  - So…. hoping future updates to these “Top …” pages will have way more data. 
- Also, was planning on recording a [Test & Code](https://testandcode.com) episode on pytest-cov today, but haven’t yet. Hopefully at least a couple of new episodes this week.
- Finally updated [pythontest.com](https://pythontest.com) with BlueSky links on home page and contact page.

Michael:

- Follow up from Owen ([uv-secure](https://github.com/owenlamont/uv-secure)):
  - Thanks for the multiple shout outs! uv-secure just uses the PyPi json API at present to query package vulnerabilities (same as default source for pip audit). I do smash it asynchronously for all dependencies at once... but it still takes a few seconds.
