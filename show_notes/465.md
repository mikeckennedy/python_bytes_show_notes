**Brian #2: [How we made Python's packaging library 3x faster](https://iscinumpy.dev/post/packaging-faster/)**

- Henry Schreiner
- Some very cool graphs demonstrating some benchmark data.
- And then details about how various speedups
  - each being 2-37% faster
  - the total adding up to about 3x speedup, or shaving 2/3 of the time.
- These also include nice write-ups about why the speedups were chosen.
- If you are trying to speed up part of your system, this would be good article to check out.

**Michael #3**: AI’s Impact on dev companies

- **On TailwindCSS**: [via Simon](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/7/adam-wathan/#atom-everything)
  - Tailwind is growing faster than ever and is bigger than it has ever been
  - Its revenue is down close to 80%.
  - 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business.
  - “We had 6 months left”
  - Listen to the founder: “[A Morning Walk](https://adams-morning-walk.transistor.fm/episodes/we-had-six-months-left)”
  - Super insightful video: [Tailwind is in DEEP trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgch1vcptQ&pp=0gcJCU0KAYcqIYzv)
- **On Stack Overflow**: [See video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0fp4Pab0g).
  - SO was founded around 2009, first month had 3,749 questions
  - December, SO had 3,862 questions asked
  - Most of its live it had 200,000 questions per month
  - That is a 53x drop!

**Brian #4: CodSpeed**

- “CodSpeed integrates into dev and CI workflows to measure performance, detect regressions, and enable actionable optimizations.”
- Noticed it while looking through the [GitHub workflows for FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml)
- Free for small teams and open-source projects
- Easy to integrate with Python by marking tests with `@pytest.mark.benchmark`
- They’ve releases a GitHub action to incorporate benchmarking in CI workflows

**Extras**

Brian:

- Part 2 of [Lean TDD](https://courses.pythontest.com/lean-tdd/) released this morning, “Lean TDD Practices”, which has 9 mini chapters.

Michael:

- Our Docker build just broke because of [the supply chain techniques from last week](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/devops-python-supply-chain-security/) (that’s a good thing!). Not a real issue, but really did catch an open CVE.
- [Long passwords are bad now](https://instatunnel.my/blog/the-1mb-password-crashing-backends-via-hashing-exhaustion)? ;)
