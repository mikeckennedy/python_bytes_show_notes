**Michael #1:** [pyx - *optimized backend for uv*](https://astral.sh/blog/introducing-pyx)

- via John Hagen (thanks again)
- I’ll be interviewing Charlie in 9 days on Talk Python → Sign up (get notified) of the [livestream here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKBcgBgK7gc).
- Not a PyPI replacement, more of a middleware layer to make it better, faster, stronger.
- pyx is a paid service, with maybe a free option eventually.

**Brian #2: [Litestar is worth a look](https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2025/aug/06/litestar/)**

- James Bennett
- Michael brought up [Litestar](https://litestar.dev) in [episode 444](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/411/tls-client-hello-guitar-solo) when talking about rewriting TalkPython in Quart
- James brings up
  - scaling - Litestar is easy to split an app into multiple files
  - Not using pydantic - You can use pydantic with Litestar, but you don’t have to. Maybe attrs is right for you instead.
- Michael brought up
  - Litestar seems like a “more batteries included” option.
  - Somewhere between FastAPI and Django.

**Brian #3: [Django remake migrations](https://django-remake-migrations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)**

- Suggested by [Bruno Alla on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/browniebroke.com/post/3lw7cfc3p662p)
- In response to a [migrations topic last week](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/444/begone-python-of-yore)
- django-remake-migrations is a tool to help you with migrations and the docs do a great job of describing the problem way better than I did last week
- “The built-in `squashmigrations` command is great, but it only work on a single app at a time, which means that you need to run it for each app in your project. On a project with enough cross-apps dependencies, it can be tricky to run.”
- “This command aims at solving this problem, by recreating all the migration files in the whole project, from scratch, and mark them as applied by using the `replaces` attribute.**”**
- Also of note
  - The package was created with [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  - Michael brought up Copier in 2021 in [episode 219](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/219/htmx-dynamic-and-live-html-without-javascript)
  - It has a nice [comparison table with CookieCutter and Yoeman](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/comparisons/)
  - One difference from CookieCutter is yml vs json.
  - I’m actually not a huge fan of handwriting either. But I guess I’d rather hand write yml.
  - So I’m thinking of trying Copier with my future project template needs.

**Michael #4: [django-chronos](https://github.com/djpeacher/django-chronos)**

- Django middleware that shows you how fast your pages load, right in your browser.
- Displays request timing and query counts for your views and middleware.
- Times middleware, view, and total per request (CPU and DB).
