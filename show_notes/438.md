**Brian #1: [Python Cheat Sheets from Trey Hunner](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/articles/cheat-sheet/)**

**Michael #2: [Automatisch](https://automatisch.io)**

- Open source Zapier alternative
- Automatisch helps you to automate your business processes without coding.
- Use their affordable cloud solution or self-host on your own servers.
- Automatisch allows you to store your data on your own servers, good for companies dealing with sensitive user data, particularly in industries like healthcare and finance, or those based in Europe bound by General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Michael #3: [mureq-typed](https://github.com/hbmartin/mureq-typed)**

- Single file, zero-dependency alternative to requests. Fully typed. Modern Python tooling.
- Typed version of mureq (covered in 2022 on episode 268)
- Intended to be vendored in-tree by Linux systems software and other lightweight applications.
- `mureq-typed` is a drop-in, fully API compatible replacement for mureq updated with modern Python tooling:
- Type checked with mypy, ty, and pyrefly.
- Formatted with black, no ignore rules necessary.
- Linted with ruff (add [these rules](https://github.com/hbmartin/mureq-typed/blob/master/ruff.toml#L11) for `mureq.py` to your `per-file-ignores`).

**Brian #4: [My CLI World](https://frankwiles.com/posts/my-cli-world/)**

- Notes
  - We covered [poethepoet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html) recently, if just just isn’t cutting it for you.
  - I tried to ilke starship, bit for some reason with my setup, it slows down the shell too much.

**Extras**

Brian:

- Interesting read of the week: [**New theory proposes time has three dimensions, with space as a secondary effect**](https://phys.org/news/2025-06-theory-dimensions-space-secondary-effect.html)
- Michael's: [**New quantum theory of gravity brings long-sought 'theory of everything' a crucial step closer**](https://phys.org/news/2025-05-quantum-theory-gravity-sought-crucial.html)

**Joke:**

- Brian read a few quotes from the book 

  Disappointing Affirmations, by Dave Tarnowski

  - “You are always just a moment away from your next worst day ever. Or your next best day ever, but let’s be realistic.”
  - “You can be anything you want. And yet you keep choosing to be you. I admire your dedication to the role.”
  - “Today I am letting go of the things that are holding me back from the life that I want to live. Then I’m picking them all up again because I have separation anxiety.”
