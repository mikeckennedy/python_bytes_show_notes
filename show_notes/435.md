**Michael #1:** [**platformdirs**](https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/)

- A small Python module for determining appropriate platform-specific dirs, e.g. a "user data dir".
- **Why the community moved on from** **appdirs** **to** **platformdirs**
- At AppDirs:
  - Note: This project has been officially deprecated. You may want to check out [pypi.org/project/platformdirs/](https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/) which is a more active fork of appdirs. Thanks to everyone who has used appdirs. Shout out to ActiveState for the time they gave their employees to work on this over the years.
- Better than AppDirs:
  - **Works today, works tomorrow** – new Python releases sometimes change low-level APIs (win32com, pathlib, Apple sandbox rules). platformdirs tracks those changes so your code keeps running.
  - **First-class typing** – no more types-appdirs stubs; editors autocomplete paths as Path objects.
  - **Richer directory set** – if you need a user’s **Downloads** folder or a per-session **runtime dir**, there’s a helper for it.
  - **Cleaner internals** – rewritten to use pathlib, caching, and extensive test coverage; all platforms are exercised in CI.
  - **Community stewardship** – the project lives in the PyPA orbit and gets security/compatibility patches quickly.

**Brian #2:** [**poethepoet**](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html) **-** **“**Poe the Poet is a batteries included task runner that works well with poetry or with uv.”

- from [Bob Belderbos](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bbelderbos_i-love-makefiles-they-save-me-time-and-help-activity-7335215074938089473-4sOm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&rcm=ACoAAAD3mh8BiKsgWuoxCvrNNA1YysaKpZ6oaS0)
- Tasks are [easy to define](https://poethepoet.natn.io/tasks/index.html) and are defined in pyproject.toml

**Michael #3:** [Python Pandas Ditches NumPy for Speedier PyArrow](https://thenewstack.io/python-pandas-ditches-numpy-for-speedier-pyarrow/)

-  Pandas 3.0 will significantly boost performance by replacing NumPy with PyArrow as its default engine, enabling faster loading and reading of columnar data.
- Recently [talked with Reuven Lerner about this on Talk Python too](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/503/the-pyarrow-revolution).
- In the next version, v3.0, PyArrow [will be a required dependency](https://pandas.pydata.org/pdeps/0010-required-pyarrow-dependency.html), with *pyarrow.string* being the default type inferred for string data.
- PyArrow is 10 times faster.
- [PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) offers [columnar storage](https://thenewstack.io/apache-arrow-designed-accelerate-hadoop-spark-columnar-layouts-data/), which eliminates all that computational back and forth that comes with NumPy. 
- PyArrow paves the way for running Pandas, by default, on [Copy on Write](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/user_guide/copy_on_write.html) mode, which improves memory and performance usage.

**Brian #4:** [**pointblank:** ](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/)[*Data validation made beautiful and powerful*](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/)

- “With its … chainable API, you can … validate your data against comprehensive quality checks …”
