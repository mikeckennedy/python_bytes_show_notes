**Brian #3:** [**Python: Import by string with pkgutil.resolve_name()**](https://adamj.eu/tech/2024/06/17/python-import-by-string/)

- Adam Johnson
- You can use pkgutil.resolve_name("<package>:<object>")to import classes, functions or modules using strings. 
- You can also use importlib.import_module("<modulename>") 
- Both of these techniques are so that you have an object imported, but the end thing isn’t imported into the local namespace.
