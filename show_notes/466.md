**Brian #1: Better Django management commands with django-click and django-typer**

- Lacy Henschel
- Extend Django [`manage.py`](http://manage.py) commands for your own project, for things like
  - data operations
  - API integrations
  - complex data transformations
  - development and debugging
- Extending is built into Django, but it looks easier, less code, and more fun with either [`django-click`](https://github.com/django-commons/django-click) or [`django-typer`](https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer), two projects supported through [Django Commons](https://github.com/django-commons)

**Michael #2: [PSF Lands a $1.5 million sponsorship from Anthropic](https://pyfound.blogspot.com)**

- Anthropic is partnering with the Python Software Foundation in a landmark funding commitment to support both security initiatives and the PSF's core work.
- The funds will enable new automated tools for proactively reviewing all packages uploaded to PyPI, moving beyond the current reactive-only review process.
- The PSF plans to build a new dataset of known malware for capability analysis
- The investment will sustain programs like the Developer in Residence initiative, community grants, and infrastructure like PyPI.

**Brian #3: [How uv got so fast](https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/26/how-uv-got-so-fast.html)**

- Andrew Nesbitt
- It’s not just be cause “it’s written in Rust”.
- Recent-ish standards, PEPs 518 (2016), 517 (2017), 621 (2020), and 658 (2022) made many `uv` design decisions possible
- And `uv` drops many backwards compatible decisions kept by `pip`.
- Dropping functionality speeds things up.
  - “Speed comes from elimination. Every code path you don’t have is a code path you don’t wait for.”
- Some of what uv does could be implemented in pip. Some cannot.
- Andrew discusses different speedups, why they could be done in Python also, or why they cannot.
- I read this article out of interest. But it gives me lots of ideas for tools that could be written faster just with Python by making design and support decisions that eliminate whole workflows.

**Michael #4: [PyView Web Framework](https://pyview.rocks)**

- PyView brings the [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) paradigm to Python
- Recently [interviewed Larry on Talk Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RDxN71azs)
- Build dynamic, real-time web applications using server-rendered HTML
- Check out [the examples](https://examples.pyview.rocks).
  - See the Maps demo for some real magic
- How does this possibly work? See the [LiveView Lifecycle](https://pyview.rocks/core-concepts/liveview-lifecycle/).

**Extras**

Brian:

- [Upgrade Django](https://upgradedjango.com), has a great discussion of how to upgrade version by version and why you might want to do that instead of just jumping ahead to the latest version. And also who might want to save time by leapfrogging
  - Also has all the versions and dates of release and end of support.
- The [Lean TDD](https://courses.pythontest.com/lean-tdd/) book 1st draft is done.
  - Now available through both [pythontest](https://courses.pythontest.com/lean-tdd/) and [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/lean-tdd)
    - I set it as 80% done because of future drafts planned.
  - I’m working through a few submitted suggestions. Not much feedback, so the 2nd pass might be fast and mostly my own modifications. It’s possible.
  - I’m re-reading it myself and already am disappointed with page 1 of the introduction. I gotta make it pop more. I’ll work on that.
  - Trying to decide how many suggestions around using AI I should include.
    - It’s not mentioned in the book yet, but I think I need to incorporate some discussion around it.

Michael:
- [Python: What’s Coming in 2026](https://thenewstack.io/python-whats-coming-in-2026/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin)
- Python Bytes rewritten in Quart + async (very similar to [Talk Python’s journey](https://talkpython.fm/blog/posts/talk-python-rewritten-in-quart-async-flask/))
- Added [a proper MCP server](https://talkpython.fm/api/mcp/docs) at Talk Python To Me (you don’t need a formal MCP framework btw)
  - Example one: [latest-episodes-mcp.png](https://blobs.pythonbytes.fm/latest-episodes-mcp.png?cache_id=b76dc6)
  - Example two: [which-episodes-mcp.webp](https://blobs.pythonbytes.fm/which-episodes-mcp.webp?cache_id=2079d2)
- [Implmented /llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org) for Talk Python To Me (see [talkpython.fm/llms.txt](http://talkpython.fm/llms.txt) )
- [Biggest prompt yet?](https://blobs.pythonbytes.fm/big-prompt-or-what-2026-01.png) **72 pages, 11, 000 words**!
