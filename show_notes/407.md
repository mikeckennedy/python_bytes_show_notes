**Michael #1:** [Python 3.14.0 alpha 1 is now available](https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2024/10/python-3140-alpha-1-is-now-available.html)

- First of seven planned alpha releases.
- Many new features for Python 3.14 are still being planned and written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:
  - [PEP 649](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/): [deferred evaluation of annotations](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-649-deferred-evaluation-of-annotations)
  - [Improved error messages](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#improved-error-messages)

**Brian #2:** [**uv supports dependency groups**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/8272)

- [we covered dependency groups in episode 406](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/406/whats-on-django-tv-tonight)
- as of [0.4.27](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), uv supports dependency groups
- docs show [how to add dependencies](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/) with uv add --group
  - also “The --dev, --only-dev, and --no-dev flags are equivalent to --group dev, --only-group dev, and --no-group dev respectively.”
- To install a group, uv pip install --group doesn’t work yet. 
  - It’s waiting for PyPA to decide on an interface for pip, and uv pip will use that interface.
- But sync works.

```
$ uv init # create a pyproject.toml
$ uv add --group foo pytest
$ uv venv # create venv
$ uv sync --group foo # will install all dependencies, including group "foo"
```

**Michael #3:** [dive: A tool for exploring each layer in a docker image](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive)

- via Mike Fiedler
- Features:
  - Show Docker image contents broken down by layer
  - Indicate what's changed in each layer
  - Estimate "image efficiency"
  - Quick build/analysis cycles
  - CI Integration

**Brian #4:** [**pytest-metadata**](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-metadata/)

- An incredibly useful plugin for adding, you guessed it, metadata, to your pytest results.
- Required for [pytest-html](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-html/) but also useful on it’s own
- Adds metadata to
  - text output with --verbose
  - xml output when using --junit-xml, handy for CI systems that support junit.xml
- Other plugins depend on this and report in other ways, such as pytest-html
- By default, already grabs
  - Python version
  - Platform info
  - List of installed packages
  - List of installed pytest plugins
- You can add your own metadata
- You can access all metadata (and add to it) from tests, fixtures, and hook functions via a metadata fixture.
- This is in the [Top pytest Plugins list](https://pythontest.com/top-pytest-plugins/), currently #5.

**Extras** 

Brian:

- I’ve started filtering deprecated plugins from [the pytest plugin list](https://pythontest.com/top-pytest-plugins/).
- I’m also going to start reviewing the list and pulling out interesting plugins as the topic of the [next season of Test & Code](https://testandcode.com).
