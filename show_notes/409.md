**Michael #1:** [**terminal-tree**](https://github.com/willmcgugan/terminal-tree)

- An experimental filesystem navigator for the terminal, built with [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual)
- Tested in macOS only at this point. Chances are very high it works on Linux. Slightly lower chance (but non-zero) that it works on Windows.
  - Can confirm it works on Linux

**Brian #2:** [posting: The API client that lives in your terminal](https://posting.sh)

- Also uses Textual
- From Darren Burns
- Interesting that the installation instructions recommends using uv:
  - uv tool install --python 3.12 posting
- Very cool. Great docs. Beautiful. keyboard centric, but also usable with a mouse.
- “Fly through your API workflow with an approachable yet powerful **keyboard-centric** interface. Run it locally or **over SSH** on remote machines and containers. Save your requests in a readable and **version-control friendly** format.”
- Able to save multiple environments
- Great colors
- Allows scripting to run Python code before and after requests to prepare headers, set variables, etc.

**Michael #3:** **Extra, extra, extra**

- [spaCy course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/getting-started-with-spacy) swag give-away, [enter for free](https://forms.gle/MJPWh3VCB58Peegj7)
- New essay: [Opposite of Cloud Native is?](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/opposite-of-cloud-native-is-stack-native/)
- News: [We've moved to Hetzner](https://talkpython.fm/blog/posts/we-have-moved-to-hetzner/)
- New package: [Introducing chameleon-flask package](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/introducing-the-chameleon-flask-package/)
- New release: [Listmonk Python client](https://github.com/mikeckennedy/listmonk)
- [TIOBE Update](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)
- [PEP 750 – Template Strings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/)
- [Canary email](https://canarymail.io)
- Left Omnivore, for Pocket, left Pocket for, …, landed on [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com)
  - Supports direct import from Omnivore and Pocket
  - Though [Hoarder](https://hoarder.app/) is compelling
- Trying out [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/)
  - Wasn’t a fan of Arc ([especially](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/arc-browser-creator-moving-project-151945233.html)[ now)](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/arc-browser-creator-moving-project-151945233.html) but the news turned me on to Zen

**Brian #4:** [UV does everything or enough that I'm not sure what else it needs to do](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/11/03/uv-does-everything.html)

- Jeff Triplett
- “UV feels like one of those old infomercials where it solves everything, which is where we have landed in the Python world.”
- “My favorite feature is that UV can now bootstrap a project to run on a machine that does not previously have Python installed, along with installing any packages your application might require.”
- Partial list (see Jeff’s post for his complete list)
  - uv pip install replaces pip install
  - uv venv replaces python -m venv
  - uv run, uv tool run, and uv tool install replaces pipx
  - uv build - Build your Python package for pypi
  - uv publish - Upload your Python package to pypi, replacing twine and flit publish

**Extras** 

Brian:

- [Coverage.py originally ](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202411/coveragepy_originally.html)was just one file
- Trying out BlueSky [brianokken.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/brianokken.bsky.social)
  - Not because of Taylor Swift, but nice. 
  - There are a lot of Python people there.
