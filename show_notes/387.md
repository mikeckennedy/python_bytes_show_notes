**Michael #3:** [Distroless Python](https://github.com/wolfi-dev)

- via Patrick Smyth
- What is [distroless](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/minimal-container-images-towards-a-more-secure-future) anyway?
  - These are container images without package managers or shells included.
  - Debugging these images presents some wrinkles (can't just exec into a shell inside the image), but they're a lot more secure.
- Chainguard, creates low/no CVE distroless images based on our FOSS distroless OS, [Wolfi](https://github.com/wolfi-dev).
- Some Python use-cases:

```
docker run -it cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest 
# The entrypoint is a Python REPL, since no b/a/sh is included
docker run -it cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev 
# This is their dev version and has pip, bash, apk, etc.
```
