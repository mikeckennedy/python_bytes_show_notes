**Michael #1:** [**Marimo:**](https://marimo.io)[ ](https://marimo.io)[**“Future**](https://marimo.io)[ **of Notebooks”**](https://marimo.io)

- via Matt Wilkie
- An **open-source** reactive notebook for Python
- Run one cell and marimo reacts by **automatically running affected cells**, eliminating the error-prone chore of managing notebook state.
- Marimo's reactive **UI elements**, like dataframe GUIs and plots, make working with data feel refreshingly fast, futuristic, and intuitive.
- Rapidly experiment with code and models
- Bind UI elements to Python values
- Pick-up-and-play design, with depth for power users
- See [the FAQ](https://docs.marimo.io/faq.html)

**Brian #2:** [**pytest 8.3.0 & 8.3.1 are out**](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html#pytest-8-3-1-2024-07-20)

- Real excited to get --xfail-tb flag added
  - This detaches xfail tracebacks from -rx/-ra (which was how it was pre-8.0)
- Keyword matching for marker expressions, that’s fun.
  - pytest -v -m "device(serial='123')"
- --no-fold-skipped  allows for explit reporting of names of skipped tests
- Plus many more improvements, bug fixes, and doc improvements

**Brian #4:** [**bash-dungeon**](https://github.com/wolandark/bash-dungeon/)

- “*This game is intended to teach new users how to use their shell in a fun and interactive way.”*
- Just clone the repo and start exploring with cd, ls, and cat.
- First moves
  - cd bash-dungeon
  - ls
  - cd Enter
  - ls
  - cat parchment
- A fun way to learn some commands you might need and/or might have forgotten about.

**Joke:** 

- [40 Million in in Series A Funding](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/investment-2?utm_source=pocket_saves) - may be a lot of reading, but I found it funny
  - Thanks to VM Brasseur for sharing this one.
- Also a few from [pyjokes 0.7.2](https://pypi.org/project/pyjokes/0.7.2/#history) (first new version since 2019)
  - If at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0.
  - A product manager walks into a bar, asks for drink. Bartender says no, but will consider adding later.
  - Triumphantly, Beth removed Python 2.7 from her server in 2030. 'Finally!' she said with glee, only to see the announcement for Python 4.4.1
    - Although, if [CalVer, PEP 2026](https://peps.python.org/pep-2026/), happens, that’ll just be Python 3.30.0.
