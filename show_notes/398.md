  - Features are planned
  - If the source code is available, it’s open source
  - A project with no commits for 12 months is abandoned
  - Many eyes make all bugs shallow
  - Open source has worse UX
  - Open source has better UX
  - Open source makes you rich

**Michael #2:** [**uv 3.0 and all the excitement**](https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging)

- End-to-end project management: uv run, uv lock, and uv sync
- Tool management: uv tool install and uv tool run (aliased to uvx)
- Python installation: uv python install
- Script execution: uv can now manage hermetic, single-file Python scripts with inline dependency metadata based on PEP 723.

**Brian #3:** [**Top pytest Plugins**](https://pythontest.com/top-pytest-plugins/)

- Thanks [Jeff Triplett & Hugo for answering how to add Summary and other info](https://fosstodon.org/@brianokken/113024832168707843)

**Michael #4:** [A comparison of hosts / providers for Python serverless functions](https://github.com/hbmartin/comparison-hosts-serverless-cloud-function-faas-for-python?tab=readme-ov-file)[ ](https://github.com/hbmartin/comparison-hosts-serverless-cloud-function-faas-for-python?tab=readme-ov-file)[(aka](https://github.com/hbmartin/comparison-hosts-serverless-cloud-function-faas-for-python?tab=readme-ov-file)[ Faas)](https://github.com/hbmartin/comparison-hosts-serverless-cloud-function-faas-for-python?tab=readme-ov-file)

- Nice feature matrix of all the options, frameworks, costs, and more
- The WASM ones look particularly interesting to me.
