## News items
[**PyData DC 2016 videos are out**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGVZCDnMOq0qLoYpkeySVtfdbQg1A_GiB)

[**easyargs**](https://github.com/stedmeister/easyargs)

- A python module to make handling command line arguments easy
- There are many ways to create a command line parser in python: argparse, docopt, click. These are all great options, but require quite a lot of configuration and sometimes you just need a function to be called. Enter easyargs. Define the function that you want to be called, decorate it and let easyargs work out the command line.

[**safety-db** via github](https://github.com/pyupio/safety-db)

- A curated database of insecure Python packages
- **What is this?** This is an effort to collect all known security vulnerabilities in Python packages and make them available to consume for humans and automated tools.
- **What is this not?** This is not a hall of shame, or a list of packages to avoid. The package maintainers show a great responsibility by documenting and fixing security issues in such a way that they can be listed here. That's extremely valuable when considering using a package in production.

[**fast-style-transfer**](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer)

- Since A-Ha's take on me video, I've loved the idea of short video done in stylized art format. 
- Uses Tenserflow, which I've never used before. No practical use I can think of, but would be fun.

[**pip 9.0 is out!**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/)

- New: Add a pip check command to check installed packages dependencies
- pip show is less verbose by default. 
- Add --not-required option to pip list, which lists packages that are not dependencies of other packages.
- Many more, including fixes
- 9.0.1 (4 days later with 5 fixes)

[**What does Reddit think about the new MBP?**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/knowsuchagency/mpb-sentiment-analysis-example/blob/master/index.ipynb)

-  I'd never even heard of sentiment analysis before. This is cool that it's topical, interesting, and short.
