**Michael #1:** [**Django 4.0 beta 1 released**](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2021/oct/25/django-40-beta-1-released/)
- Django 4.0 beta 1 is now available.
- Django 4.0 has an abundance of [**new features**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/releases/4.0/)
    - The new `[*expressions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/constraints/#django.db.models.UniqueConstraint.expressions)` positional argument of `[UniqueConstraint()](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/constraints/#django.db.models.UniqueConstraint)` enables creating functional unique constraints on expressions and database functions.
    - The new [scrypt password hasher](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/auth/passwords/#scrypt-usage) is more secure and recommended over PBKDF2.
    - The new `django.core.cache.backends.redis.RedisCache` cache backend provides built-in support for caching with Redis.
    - To enhance customization of `[Forms](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/forms/api/#django.forms.Form)`, [Formsets](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/forms/formsets/), and `[ErrorList](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/forms/api/#django.forms.ErrorList)` they are now rendered using the template engine.


**Brian #2: py - The Python launcher**

- `py` has been bundled with Python for Windows only since Python 3.3, as `py.exe`
    - See [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) 
    - I‚Äôve mostly ignored it since I use Python on Windows, MacOS, and Linux and don‚Äôt want to have different workflows on different systems.
- But now Brett Cannon has developed [python-launcher](https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher) which brings `py` to MacOS and various other Unix-y systems or any OS which supports Rust. 
- Now
    - `py` is everywhere I need it to be, and I‚Äôve switched my workflow to use it.
- Usage 
    - `py` : Run the latest Python version on your system
    - `py -3` : Run the latest Python 3 version
    - `py -3.9` : Run latest 3.9 version
    - `py -2.7` : Even run 2.x versions
    - `py` `--``list` : list all versions (with py-launcher, it also lists paths)
    - `py` `--``list-paths` : py.exe only - list all versions with path
- **Why is this cool?** 
        - **I never have to care where Python is installed or where it is in my search path.**
        - **I can always run any version of Python installed without setting up symbolic links.**
        - **Same workflow works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux**
    - Old workfow
        - Make sure latest Python is found first in search path, then call `python3 -m venv venv`
        - For a specific version, make sure `python3.8`, for example, or `python38` or something is in my Path. If not, create it somewhere.
    - New workflow.
        - `py -m venv venv` - Create a virtual environment with the latest Python installed. 
        - After activation, everything happens in the virtual env.
    - Create a specific venv to test something on an older version:
        - `py -3.8 venv venv` `--``prompt` `'``3.8``'`
    - Or even just run a script with an old version
        - `py -3.8 script_name.py`
    - Of course, you can run it with the latest version also
        - `py script_name.py`
- Note: if you use `py` within a virtual environment, the default version is the one from the virtual env, not the latest. 


Morleh **#3:** [**Transformers As General**](https://www.stateof.ai/2021-report-launch.html)[-](https://www.stateof.ai/2021-report-launch.html)[**Purpose Architecture**](https://www.stateof.ai/2021-report-launch.html)

- The [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper first proposed Transformers in June 2017.  
- The [Hugging Face (ü§ó) Transformers](https://huggingface.co/) package is a popular PYTHON library providing pre-trained models that are extraordinarily useful for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 
- It earlier supported only PyTorch, but, in 2019, it supported TensorFlow 2 
- ü§ó Transformers provides the following tasks out of the box: Sentiment analysis, Text generation, Question answering, Filling masked text, Summarization, Language Translation, Feature Extraction.
- The [State of AI Report 2021](https://www.stateof.ai/2021-report-launch.html) (Nathan Beniach and Ian Hogarth) came out in late October, highlighting the role of transformers.
- "Transformers have emerged as a general-purpose architecture for ML. Not just for Natural Language Processing, but also Speech, Computer Vision or even protein structure prediction."
    - Examples include Google's [Vision Transformer (ViT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) and CoAtNet
- Transformers are fulfilling the [Transfer Learning promise](https://becominghuman.ai/the-age-of-machine-learning-as-code-has-arrived-9eb00e0eb7a8), saving training time and costs.
- ü§ó Transformers has a partnership with AWS to make it easier to leverage Machine Learning models.


**Michael #4:** [**Model bakery**](https://model-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- Model Bakery offers you a smart way to create fixtures for testing in Django.
- [**Usage example**](https://model-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#basic-usage) **- generates a randomly populated Django Model (DB Entity)**
- If you‚Äôre not comfortable with random data or even if you just want to improve the semantics of the generated data, there‚Äôs hope for you. [**Use recipes**](https://model-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes.html#recipes). 


**Brian #5:**  [**Coverage goals, goals.py**](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202111/coverage_goals.html)

- Ned Batchelder
- Ned wrote `goals.py` as a proof of concept to try out a feature request for coverage.py
- Allows something like ‚Äú100% coverage in tests and 85% in product code‚Äù requirements.
- You give it a percentage number, and a list of glob patterns, and the return code indicates failure.
- You can run it several times on the same coverage output to have complex requirements.
- Example

```
    # We want to make sure all tests are run
    $ python goals.py --group 100 'tests/*.py'
    
    # Check all Python files collectively, except in the tests/ directory.
    $ python goals.py --group 85 '**/*.py' '!tests/*.py'
    
    # We definitely want complete coverage of anything related to html.
    $ python goals.py --group 100 '**/*html*.py'
    
    # No Python file should be below 90% covered.
    $ python goals.py --file 90 '**/*.py'
```

Morleh **#6:** [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

- Web3.py is the PYTHON library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain.
- Web3.py lets you develop clients that interact with the Ethereum Blockchain.
- Web3.py is a collection of libraries that enable you to create Ethereum transactions.
- It is found in decentralized apps (dapps) to help with sending transactions, interacting (write or read) with and executing smart contracts or business logic.
