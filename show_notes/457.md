**Michael #1: [httptap](https://httptap.dev)**

- Rich-powered CLI that breaks each HTTP request into DNS, connect, TLS, wait, and transfer phases with waterfall timelines, compact summaries, or metrics-only output.
- Features
  - **Phase-by-phase timing** – precise measurements built from httpcore trace hooks (with sane fallbacks when metal-level data is unavailable).
  - **All HTTP methods** – GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS with request body support.
  - **Request body support** – send JSON, XML, or any data inline or from file with automatic Content-Type detection.
  - **IPv4/IPv6 aware** – the resolver and TLS inspector report both the address and its family.
  - **TLS insights** – certificate CN, expiry countdown, cipher suite, and protocol version are captured automatically.
  - **Multiple output modes** – rich waterfall view, compact single-line summaries, or `-metrics-only` for scripting.
  - **JSON export** – persist full step data (including redirect chains) for later processing.
  - **Extensible** – clean Protocol interfaces for DNS, TLS, timing, visualization, and export so you can plug in custom behavior.

**Brian #2: [10 Smart Performance Hacks For Faster Python Code](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/11/10-smart-performance-hacks-for-faster-python-code/)**

- Dido Grigorov
- A few from the list
  - Use math functions instead of operators
  - Avoid exception handling in hot loops
  - Use itertools for combinatorial operations - huge speedup
  - Use bisect for sorted list operations - huge speedup

**Michael #3: [FastRTC](https://fastrtc.org)**

- The Real-Time Communication Library for Python: Turn any python function into a real-time audio and video stream over WebRTC or WebSockets.
- Features
  - 🗣️ Automatic Voice Detection and Turn Taking built-in, only worry about the logic for responding to the user.
  - 💻 Automatic UI - Use the `.ui.launch()` method to launch the webRTC-enabled built-in Gradio UI.
  - 🔌 Automatic WebRTC Support - Use the `.mount(app)` method to mount the stream on a FastAPI app and get a webRTC endpoint for your own frontend!
  - ⚡️ Websocket Support - Use the `.mount(app)` method to mount the stream on a FastAPI app and get a websocket endpoint for your own frontend!
  - 📞 Automatic Telephone Support - Use the `fastphone()` method of the stream to launch the application and get a free temporary phone number!
  - 🤖 Completely customizable backend - A `Stream` can easily be mounted on a FastAPI app so you can easily extend it to fit your production application. See the [Talk To Claude](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fastrtc/talk-to-claude) demo for an example of how to serve a custom JS frontend.

**Brian #4: [Explore Python dependencies with `pipdeptree` and `uv pip tree`](https://pythontest.com/pipdeptree-uv-pip-tree/)**

- Suggested by Nicholas Carsner
  - We have covered it, but in 2017 on [episode 17.](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/17/googles-python-is-on-fire-and-simon-says-you-have-cpu-load-pythonically)
- [**pipdeptree](https://github.com/tox-dev/pipdeptree/blob/main/README.md#pipdeptree)**
  - Use `pipdeptree --python auto` to allow it to read your venv
- [**uv pip tree**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-tree)
  - Also check out `uv pip tree` and some useful flags
    - `--show-version-specifiers` to show the rules
    - `--outdated` notes packages that need updated

**Extras**

Brian:

- [Lean TDD 0.1.1](https://courses.pythontest.com/lean-tdd/) includes an updated intro and another chapter, “Essential Components”
- [VSCode Peacock Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock) - color code your different projects
