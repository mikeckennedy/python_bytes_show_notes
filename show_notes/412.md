**Brian #1:** [**Loop targets**](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202411/loop_targets.html)

- Ned Batchelder
- I don’t think I would have covered this had it not been the surprising opposition to Ned’s code.
- Here’s the snippet:

```
params = {
  "query": QUERY,
  "page_size": 100,
}
*# Get page=0, page=1, page=2, ...*
**for** params["page"] in itertools.count():
  data = requests.get(SEARCH_URL, params).json()
  **if** not data["results"]:
    **break**
  ...
```

- Ned is utilizing the assignment in the for loop to use the value of count() and store it into the params["page"].
- The article includes another version with a temp variable page_num, which I think the naysayers would prefer.
- But frankly, I think both are fine. Why not put the value right where you want it?

**Michael #2:** [asyncstdlib](https://github.com/maxfischer2781/asyncstdlib)

- The asyncstdlib library re-implements functions and classes of the Python standard library to make them compatible with async callables, iterables and context managers. 
- It is fully agnostic to async event loops and seamlessly works with asyncio, third-party libraries such as trio, as well as any custom async event loop.
- Full set of async versions of advantageous standard library helpers, such as zip, map, enumerate, functools.reduce, itertools.tee, itertools.groupby and many others.
- Safe handling of async iterators to ensure prompt cleanup, as well as various helpers to simplify safely using custom async iterators.
- Small but powerful toolset to seamlessly integrate existing sync code into async programs and libraries.

**Brian #3:** [Bagels: TUI Expense Tracker](https://github.com/EnhancedJax/Bagels)

- Jax Tam
- “Bagels expense tracker is a TUI application where you can track and analyse your money flow, with convenience oriented features and a complete interface.

- **Why an expense tracker in the terminal?** I found it easier to build a habit and keep an accurate track of my expenses if I do it at the end of the day, instead of on the go. So why not in the terminal where it's fast, and I can keep all my data locally?”

- Who hasn’t wanted to write their own expense tracker?
- This implementation is fun for lots of reasons
  - It’s still new and pretty small, so forking it for your own uses should be easy
  - Built on textual is fun
  - install instructions based on uv tool seems to be the new normal: 
    - uv tool install --python 3.13 bagels
  - test suite started
  - pretty useful as is, actually
  - Nice that it includes a roadmap of future goals
  - Would be a fun project to help out with for anyone looking for anyone looking for a shiny new codebase to contribute to.

**Michael #4:** [rloop:](https://github.com/gi0baro/rloop) An AsyncIO event loop implemented in Rust

- An AsyncIO event loop implemented in Rust
- From Giovanni Barillari, Creator of Granian
- RLoop is an [AsyncIO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) event loop implemented in Rust on top of the [mio crate](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio).
- **Disclaimer**: This is a work in progress and definitely not ready for production usage.
- Run asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(rloop.EventLoopPolicy()) and done.
- Similar to [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop).
