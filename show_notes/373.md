**Michael #1:** [**zoxide**](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)

- zoxide is a smarter cd command, inspired by z and autojump.
- It remembers which directories you use most frequently, so you can "jump" to them in just a few keystrokes.
- zoxide works on all major shells and platforms.

**Brian #2:** [**Smart CLIs with Typer**](https://rahulpai.co.uk/smart-clis-with-typer.html)

- Rahul Pai
- Lots of TILs here, even though I‚Äôve been using Typer for years.
- Examples of
    - Auto-detection of arguments and types based on type hints
    - Help text is a smidge clunkier
    - Prompting for missing arguments 
    - Defaulting to an enviromental variable for missing args
    - Print help if no args given
    - Explicit app and subcommands with a comparison to argparse
    - Reusable commands with result_callback 
- Several topics covered in comparison with argparse
- See also [Testing argparse Applications](https://pythontest.com/testing-argparse-apps/)

**Michael #3:** [**Python recommended officially by the US Government**](https://twitter.com/samuel_colvin/status/1763339372361814187?s=12&t=RL7Nk7OAFSptvENxe1zIqA)

- The US government explicitly recommends memory safe languages.
- Python is one of them
- The comparison to big tech by Samuel is interesting

**Brian #4:** [**Textual tutorials at Mouse vs Python**](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/tag/tui/)

- Mike Driscoll
- Most recently [Creating a Modal Dialog For Your TUIs in Textual](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2024/02/06/creating-a-modal-dialog-for-your-tuis-in-textual/)
- Textualize already has some pretty great documentation at [textual.textualize.io](https://textual.textualize.io)
- But it‚Äôs cool to see some different tutorials on it.
