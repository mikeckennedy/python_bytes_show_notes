**HEADS UP: We are taking next week off, happy holiday everyone.**

**Michael #1: [Has the cost of building software just dropped 90%?](https://martinalderson.com/posts/has-the-cost-of-software-just-dropped-90-percent)**

- by Martin Alderson
- **Agentic coding tools** are collapsing “implementation time,” so the cost curve of shipping software may be shifting sharply
- Recent programming advancements **haven’t been that great of a true benefit**: Cloud, TDD, microservices, complex frontends, Kubernetes, etc.
- Agentic AI’s big savings are not just code generation, but **coordination overhead reduction** (fewer handoffs, fewer meetings, fewer blocks).
- **Thinking, product clarity, and domain decisions** stay hard, while typing and scaffolding get cheap.
- Is it the end of software dev? Not really, see **Jevons paradox**: when production gets cheaper, total demand can rise rather than spending simply falling. (Historically: the efficiency of coal use led to the increased consumption of coal)
- Pushes back on “only good for greenfield” by arguing agents also help with **legacy code comprehension and bug-fixing**. I 100% agree. #Legacy code for the win.

**Brian #2: More on Deprecation Warnings**

- How are people ignoring them?
  - yep, it’s right in the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-W): `-W ignore::DeprecationWarning`
  - Don’t do that!
  - Perhaps the docs should give the example of emitting them only once
    - `-W once::::DeprecationWarning`
- See also [**`-X dev` mode**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/devmode.html#devmode) , which sets `-W default` and some other runtime checks
- Don’t use `warn`, [use the `@warnings.deprecated` decorator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warnings.deprecated) instead
  - Thanks John Hagen for pointing this out
  - Emits a warning
  - It’s understood by type checkers, so editors visually warn you
  - You can pass in your own custom UserWarning with `category`
- [mypy also has a command line option and setting for this](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/error_code_list2.html#check-that-imported-or-used-feature-is-deprecated-deprecated)
  - `--enable-error-code deprecated`
  - or in `[tool.mypy]` `enable_error_code = ["deprecated"]`
- My recommendation
  - Use `@deprecated`
  - with your own custom warning
  - and test with `pytest -W error`

**Michael #3: [How FOSS Won and Why It Matters](https://www.softwaremaxims.com/blog/how-foss-won-consequences)**

- by Thomas Depierre
- Companies are not cheap, companies optimize *cost control.* They do this by making purchasing slow and painful.
- FOSS is/was a major unlock hack to skip procurement, legal, etc.
- Example is months to start using a paid “Add to calendar” widget!
- It “works both ways”: the same bypass lowers the barrier for maintainers too, no need for a legal entity, lawyers, liability insurance, or sales motion.
- Proposals that “fix FOSS” by reintroducing supply-chain style controls (he name-checks SBOMs and mandated processes) risk being rejected or gamed, because they restore the very friction FOSS sidesteps.

**Brian #4: Should I be looking for a GitHub alternative?**

- [Pricing changes for GitHub Actions](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/)
  - The self-hosted runner pricing change caused a kerfuffle.
  - It’s has been postponed
- But… if you were to look around, maybe pay attention to
  - [These 4 GitHub alternatives are just as good—or better](https://www.howtogeek.com/these-x-github-alternatives-are-just-as-goodor-better/)
    - [Codeburg](https://codeberg.org), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org), [**GitLab**](https://about.gitlab.com), [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com)
  - And a new-ish entry, [Tangled](https://tangled.org)

**Extras**

Brian:

- End of year sale for [The Complete pytest Course](https://courses.pythontest.com/the-complete-pytest-course-bundle)
  - Use code XMAS2025 for 50% off before Dec 31
- Writing work on [Lean TDD book](https://courses.pythontest.com/lean-tdd/) on hold for holidays
  - Will pick up again in January

Michael:

- PyCharm has better Ruff support now out of the box, via Daniel Molnar
  - This is from [the release notes of 2025.3](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/12/pycharm-2025-3-unified-ide-jupyter-notebooks-in-remote-development-uv-as-default-and-more/):  "*PyCharm 2025.3 expands its LSP integration with support for Ruff, ty, Pyright, and Pyrefly.*”
  - If you check out the LSP section it will land you [on this page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/lsp-tools.html#ruff) and you can go to Ruff.
  - The Ruff [doc site was also updated](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup/#pycharm). Previously it was only available external tools and a third party plugin, this feels like a big step.
- Fun quote I saw on ExTwitter: *May your bug tracker be forever empty*.
