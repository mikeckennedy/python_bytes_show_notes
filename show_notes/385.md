**Michael #1:** [PostgresREST](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest)

- PostgREST serves a fully RESTful API from any existing PostgreSQL database. It provides a cleaner, more standards-compliant, faster API than you are likely to write from scratch.
- Speedy
  - First the server is written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) using the [Warp](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks) HTTP server (aka a compiled language with lightweight threads). 
  - Next it delegates as much calculation as possible to the database.
  - Finally it uses the database efficiently with the [Hasql](https://nikita-volkov.github.io/hasql-benchmarks/) library
- PostgREST [handles authentication](http://postgrest.org/en/stable/auth.html) (via JSON Web Tokens) and delegates authorization to the role information defined in the database. This ensures there is a single declarative source of truth for security.

**Brian #2:** [**How Python Asyncio Works: Recreating it from Scratch**](https://jacobpadilla.com/articles/recreating-asyncio)

- Jacob Padilla
- Cool tutorial walking through how async works, including
  - Generators Review
  - The Event Loop
  - Sleeping
  - Yield to Await
  - Await with AsyncIO
- Another great async resource is:
  - [Build your Own Async](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4Gt3Xjd7G8)
    - David Beasley talk from 2019

**Michael #3:** [Bend](https://higherorderco.com)

- A massively parallel, high-level programming language.
- With **Bend** you can write parallel code for multi-core CPUs/GPUs without being a C/CUDA expert with 10 years of experience. 
- It feels just like Python!
- No need to deal with the complexity of concurrent programming: locks, mutexes, atomics... **any** work that can be done in parallel **will** be done in parallel.

**Brian #4:** [The Smartest Way to Learn Python Regular Expressions](https://leanpub.com/regexpython/)

- Christian Mayer, Zohaib Riaz, and Lukas Rieger
- Self published ebook on Python Regex that utilizes
  - book form readings, links to video course sections
  - puzzle challenges to complete online
- Itâ€™s a paid resource, but the min is free.

**Extras**
