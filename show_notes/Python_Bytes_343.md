**Michael #1:** [**Pydantic v2 released**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.0/blog/pydantic-v2-final/)

- Pydantic V2 is compatible with Python 3.7 and above.
- There is a [migration guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.0/migration/).
- Check out the [**bump-pydantic**](https://github.com/pydantic/bump-pydantic) tool to auto upgrade your classes

**Brian #2:** [**Two Ways to Turbo-Charge tox**](https://hynek.me/articles/turbo-charge-tox/)

- Hynek
- Not just `tox run-parallel` or `tox -p` or `tox` `--``parallel` , but you should know about that also. 
- The 2 ways
    - Build one wheel instead of N sdists
    - Run pytest in parallel
- `tox` builds source distributions, sdists, for each environment before running tests.
    - that‚Äôs not really what we want, especially if we have a test matrix.
    - It‚Äôd be better to build a wheel once, and use that for all the environments.
    - Add this to your tox.ini and now we get one wheel build
    [testenv]
    package = wheel
    wheel_build_env = .pkg
    - It will save time. And a lot if you have a lengthy build.
- Run `pytest` in parallel, instead of `tox` in parallel, with `pytest -n auto` 
    - Requires the `pytest-xdist` plugin.
    - Can slow down tests if your tests are pretty fast anyway.
    - If you‚Äôre using hypothesis, you probably want to try this.
- There are some gotchas and workarounds (like getting coverage to work) in the article.

**Michael #3:** [**Awesome Pydantic**](https://github.com/Kludex/awesome-pydantic)

- A curated list of awesome things related to Pydantic! üå™Ô∏è
- Notable items for me:
    - ML:
        - [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) üåü(26575) - spaCy is a free open-source library for Natural Language Processing in Python. It features NER, POS tagging, dependency parsing, word vectors and more.
        - [ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) üåü(26496) - Ray provides a simple, universal API for building distributed applications.
        - [jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) üåü(18734) - Jina is geared towards building search systems for any kind of data, including text, images, audio, video and many more. With the modular design & multi-layer abstraction, you can leverage the efficient patterns to build the system by parts, or chaining them into a Flow for an end-to-end experience.
    - Data
        - [Beanie](https://github.com/roman-right/beanie) üåü(1287) - Beanie - is an Asynchronous Python object-document mapper (ODM) for MongoDB, based on Motor and Pydantic.
    - Utilities
        - [datamodel-code-generator](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator) üåü(1694) - Pydantic model generator for easy conversion of JSON, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and YAML data sources.
        - [Goodconf](https://github.com/lincolnloop/goodconf) üåü(99) - A thin wrapper over Pydantic's settings management. Allows you to define configuration variables and load them from environment or JSON/YAML file. Also generates initial configuration files and documentation for your defined configuration.

**Brian #4:** [**CLI tools hidden in the Python standard library**](https://til.simonwillison.net/python/stdlib-cli-tools)

- Simon Willison (and hat tip to Seth Larson)
- Simon looked for all of the command line goodies in the standard library. 
- I knew about `python -m http.server` to run a server at port 8000 from the local directory, but there‚Äôs so much more.
- Here are a few
    - `python -m gzip --decompress pypi.db.gz` as a gzip utility.
        - Especially handy on Windows as it doesn‚Äôt come with gzip by default
    - `python -m base64` with `-d` decode, `-e` encode, and `-t` encode and decode
    - `python -m asyncio` for an asyncio REPL
    - Tokenize a Python file with `python -m tokenize somefile.py`
    - View the AST with `python -m ast somefile.py`
    - Pretty print JSON with `python -m json.tool`
