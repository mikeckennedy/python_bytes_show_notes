**Brian #1:** [**Making PyPI’s test suite 81% faster**](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/05/01/making-pypis-test-suite-81-faster/)

- Alexis Challande
- The PyPI backend is a project called Warehouse
- It’s tested with pytest, and it’s a large project, thousands of tests.
- Steps for speedup
  - Parallelizing test execution with pytest-xdist 
    - 67% time reduction
    - --numprocesses=auto allows for using all cores
    - DB isolation - cool example of how to config postgress to give each test worker it’s on db
    - They used pytest-sugar to help with visualization, as xdist defaults to quite terse output
  - Use Python 3.12’s sys.monitoring to speed up coverage instrumentation 
    - 53% time reduction
    - Nice example of using COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon
  - Optimize test discovery
    - Always use testpaths
    - Sped up collection time. 66% reduction (collection was 10% of time)
    - Not a huge savings, but it’s 1 line of config
  - Eliminate unnecessary imports
    - Use python -X importtime
    - Examine dependencies not used in testing.
    - Their example: ddtrace
      - A tool they use in production, but it also has a couple pytest plugins included
      - Those plugins caused ddtrace to get imported 
      - Using -p:no ddtrace turns off the plugin bits
- Notes from Brian:
  - I often get questions about if pytest is useful for large projects.
  - Short answer: Yes!
  - Longer answer: But you’ll probably want to speed it up
  - I need to extend this article with a general purpose “speeding up pytest” post or series. 
  - -p:no can also be used to turn off any plugin, even builtin ones.
    - Examples include 
      - nice to have developer focused pytest plugins that may not be necessary in CI
      - CI reporting plugins that aren’t needed by devs running tests locally

**Michael #2:** [People aren’t talking enough about how most of OpenAI’s tech stack runs on Python](https://x.com/skirano/status/1922651912156897284)

- Original article: [Building, launching, and scaling ChatGPT Images](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/chatgpt-images)
- **Tech stack:** The technology choices behind the product are surprisingly simple; dare I say, pragmatic!
  - **Python:** most of the product’s code is written in this language.
  - [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)**:** the Python framework used for building APIs quickly, using standard Python type hints. As the name suggests, FastAPI’s strength is that it takes less effort to create functional, production-ready APIs to be consumed by other services.
  - **C:** for parts of the code that need to be highly optimized, the team uses the lower-level C programming language
  - [**Temporal**](https://temporal.io/): used for asynchronous workflows and operations inside OpenAI. *Temporal is a neat workflow solution that makes multi-step workflows reliable even when individual steps crash, without much effort by developers. It’s particularly useful for longer-running workflows like image generation at scale*

**Brian #4:** [**Optimizing Python Import Performance**](https://pytutorial.com/optimize-python-import-performance/)

- Mostly pay attention to #'s 1-3
- This is related to speeding up a test suite, speeding up necessary imports.
- Finding what’s slow
  - Use python -X importtime <the reset of the command
  - Ex: python -X importtime ptyest
- Techniques
  - Lazy imports 
    - move slow-to-import imports into functions/methods
  - Avoiding circular imports 
    - hopefully you’re doing that already
  - Optimize __init__.py files 
    - Avoid unnecessary imports, heavy computations, complex logic
- Notes from Brian
  - Some questions remain open for me
    - Does module aliasing really help much?
  - This applies to testing in a big way
    - Test collection imports your test suite, so anything imported at the top level of a file gets imported at test collection time, even if you only are running a subset of tests using filtering like -x or -m or other filter methods.
    - Run -X importtime  on test collection.
    - Move slow imports into fixtures, so they get imported when needed, but NOT at collection.

  - Consider using [import_profile](https://pypi.org/project/import-profile/)

**Extras** 

Brian:

- [PEPs & Co.](https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/peps-and-co/) 
  - PEP is a ‘backronym”, an acronym where the words it stands for are filled in after the acronym is chosen. Barry Warsaw made this one up.
  - There are a lot of “enhancement proposal” and “improvement proposal” acronyms now from other communities
- [pythontest.com](https://pythontest.com) has a new theme
  - More colorful. Neat search feature
  - Now it’s excruciatingly obvious that I haven’t blogged regularly in a while
    - I gotta get on that
  - Code highlighting might need tweaked for dark mode
