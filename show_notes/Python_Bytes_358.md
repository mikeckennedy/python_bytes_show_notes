**Extras** 

Brian:

- [Where did everyone go?](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202310/where_did_everyone_go.html) - Ned Batchelder
    - I do feel like we’re more fragmented than before, but I am feeling like we have a community on Mastodon.
    - reminder that Mastodon has text search now
- On Sunday, I released Ch9, Coverage, as part of [The Complete pytest course](https://courses.pythontest.com/p/the-complete-pytest-course), specifically part of [pytest Working with Projects](https://courses.pythontest.com/p/pytest-working-with-projects).
    - It was super fun. I’ve used coverage a lot since writing the book, for example, I demonstrate branch coverage. It’s so much more effective to teach in video than in printed screenshots.
