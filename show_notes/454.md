**Brian #1: [djrest2 -** A small and simple REST library for Django based on class-based views.](https://pypi.org/project/djrest2/)

- Emma Levit
- Based on an interesting blog post
  - [Why, in 2025, do we still need a 3rd party app to write a REST API with Django?](https://emma.has-a.blog/articles/why-do-we-need-an-external-app-for-rest.html)
  - As opposed to [using DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org) or [Django Ninja](https://django-ninja.dev)
- 

Michael #2: [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

- GitHub‚Äôs official command line tool
- Features
  - Checking out a pull request locally
  - You can clone any repository using OWNER/REPO syntax: gh repo clone cli/cli
  - Create a pull request interactively: gh pr create
- See all at [cli.github.com/manual/examples](https://cli.github.com/manual/examples)

Brian #3: [caniscrape - Know before you scrape. Analyze any website's anti-bot protections in seconds.](https://github.com/ZA1815/caniscrape)

- [reddit announcement and discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ob3na1/i_built_a_tool_that_tells_you_how_hard_a_website/)

- caniscrape checks a website for common anti-bot mechanisms and reports:

  - A difficulty score (0‚Äì10)
  - Which protections are active (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, hCaptcha, etc.)
  - What tools you‚Äôll likely need (headless browsers, proxies, CAPTCHA solvers, etc.)
  - Whether using a scraping API might be better

  This helps you decide the right scraping approach before you waste time building a bot that keeps getting blocked.

**Michael #4: [üê¥ GittyUp](https://github.com/mikeckennedy/gittyup)**

- Never forget to pull again: Automatically discover and update all your Git repositories with one command.
- Built initially to solve this problem
- Rebuilt and published last week as part of my upcoming **Agentic AI Programming for Python** course. Get notified this week at [training.talkpython.fm/getnotified](https://training.talkpython.fm/getnotified)
- Update everything in a folder tree with `gittyup`
- Review changes, blockers, etc with `gittyup --explain`
