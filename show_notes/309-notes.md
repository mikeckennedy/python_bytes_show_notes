**Michael #1:** [**Malicious proof-of-concepts are exposing GitHub users to malware and more**](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/malicious-proof-of-concepts-are-exposing-github-users-to-malware-and-more)

- [**The paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08374)
- They found that of the 47,313 GitHub repositories they had downloaded and checked, 4,893 (10.3%) were malicious.
- In some the attackers were trying to plant malware on users‚Äô machines, while in others, they tried to open backdoors using CobaltStrike, for example
- Ignoring this problem can cause damage that ranges from infecting yourself as [a] user, to infecting your company and likely your customers as well if it‚Äôs a more sophisticated attack,‚Äù El Yadmani warned.

**Brian #2:** **The great Mastodon experiment**

- Context should be obvious re Twitter news.
- A lot of Python people have kept in touch via Twitter.
- A lot are now experimenting with [Mastadon](https://joinmastodon.org),
- What I did
    - asked Twitter people which server to use, then just picked fosstodon.org, but there are [many servers](https://joinmastodon.org/servers)
    - This is me:  [**@brianokken@fosstodon.org**](https://fosstodon.org/@brianokken)
    - Michael got in too: **https://fosstodon.org/@mkennedy**
    - just started using it, following people, trying iOS clients, etc.
- Now I‚Äôm ready for some tutorials, and here‚Äôs a list that looks decent:
    - [An Increasingly Less-Brief Guide to Mastodon](https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon?utm_source=pocket_saves)
    - [Everything I know about Mastodon](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/#etiquette-on-cross-posting-from-twitter)
        - A hastily written guide for data science folks trying to navigate the fediverse.
    - [Mastodon is just blogs](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/8/mastodon-is-just-blogs/) - Simon Willison is running his own server.
    - [Eight Mastodon apps for iPhone](https://transponderings.blog/2022/05/21/eight-mastodon-apps-for-iphone/) - I‚Äôm currently trying like 4, but you can also just log into your sever and do everything there.
    - [Fedi.Tips](https://fedi.tips) and their [Beginners Start Here](https://fedi.tips/mastodon-and-the-fediverse-beginners-start-here/) page


**Michael #3:** [**Gitpod and the traveling dev**](https://twitter.com/titimoby/status/1585566185961263104?s=12&t=4h7RIi-8kG9bjNWYyonA4Q)

- Gitpod is an open-source Kubernetes application for ready-to-code developer environments that spins up fresh, automated dev environments for each task, in the cloud, in seconds.
- Gitpod is paid, but there are decent free tiers
- [Features](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod#features)
- Run a desktop or browser based version of VS Code or any JetBrains IDE and customise it to your individual needs - from themes to extensions, you have full control.

**Brian #4:** **Color in the terminal**

- pytest-check currently doesn‚Äôt use color
    - but a little red for failures would be good (and was requested via an issue)
- I could use [rich](https://pypi.org/project/rich/), but maybe that‚Äôs a slightly larger hammer than I need for this job
- Maybe raw escape sequences like `print('\033[31m' + 'some red text')`
    - kinda gross
    - won‚Äôt work out of the box on Windows.
- But [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) can fix Windows.
    - It just recently added `just_fix_windows_console()`, which apparently works better than `init()` in that it can be called multiple times without blowing up. 
    - Includes easier to read codes for some basic colors, so this works:
```
from colorama import just_fix_windows_console
    from colorama import Fore, Style
    just_fix_windows_console()
    
    print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')
    print(Style.RESET_ALL)
    print('back to normal now')
```

**Extras** 

Brian:

- Simon Willison wrote [What to blog about](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/?utm_source=pocket_saves), which includes 
    - TIL (today I learned) posts that don‚Äôt need to be full tutorials
    - Projects you‚Äôve built
- I‚Äôd like to include
    - Projects in progress
    - Bug fixes or feature additions where you needed to learn a bit of something beforehand
        - Example: I should write up ‚ÄúAdding red to pytest-check‚Äù
