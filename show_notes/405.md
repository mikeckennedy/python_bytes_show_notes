**Michael #1:** [Briefer: Dashboards and notebooks in a single place](https://github.com/briefercloud/briefer)

- Notebooks and dashboards with Python, SQL, scheduling, native visualizations, code generation, and more.
- In Briefer, you can:
  - ![books](https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/1f4da.png?version=8.0.0)![bar chart](https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/1f4ca.png?version=8.0.0) **Create notebooks and dashboards** using Markdown, Python, SQL, and native visualizations.
  - ![selfie](https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/1f933.png?version=8.0.0) **Build interactive data apps** using inputs, dropdowns, and date pickers.
  - ![robot](https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/1f916.png?version=8.0.0) **Generate code and queries** using an AI that understands your database schema and your notebook's context.
  - ![mantelpiece clock](https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/1f570.png?version=8.0.0) **Schedule notebooks and dashboards** to run and update periodically.
  - ![gear](https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/2699.png?version=8.0.0) **Create and test ad-hoc pipelines** using writebacks.
- **Briefer vs. Traditional BI Tools:** Briefer is better than traditional BI tools because it's faster and more flexible, thanks to Python.
- **Briefer vs. Traditional Notebooks:** In Briefer, you can run SQL queries against connected data sources directly in your notebook. Then, **Briefer will automatically turn your query into a data frame and store it in a variable that you can use in your Python blocks**.

**Brian #2:** [Introduction to programming with Python](https://bioinf.comav.upv.es/courses/intro_programming/)

- Jose Blanca
  - “Python intro aimed at students with no prior programming experience.”
  - “Relies mainly on examples and exercises.”
  - “Does not try to cover every detail of the Python language, but just what a beginner might need to start the journey.”
  - Tech: “… built with the [quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system complemented by the [quarto live](https://github.com/r-wasm/quarto-live) extension that allows Python to run in the web browser by using [pyodide](https://pyodide.org/).”
- Runs on anything, since it doesn’t require a local install of Python
- Running 3.12.1, looks like. Although that’s a bit hidden. Seems like it should be more visible.

**Michael #3:** [setup-uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv)

- Set up your GitHub Actions workflow with a specific version of uv
- Install a version of uv and add it to PATH
- Cache the installed version of uv to speed up consecutive runs on self-hosted runners
- Register problem matchers for error output
- (Optional) Persist the uv's cache in the GitHub Actions Cache
- (Optional) Verify the checksum of the downloaded uv executable

**Brian #4:** [**HTML for people**](https://htmlforpeople.com)

- Teaching HTML in a rather fun way.
- Includes basic CSS

**Extras** 

Michael:

- A new article: [We Must Replace uWSGI With Something Else](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/we-must-replace-uwsgi-with-something-else-but-with-what/)
- [Django unique email](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-unique-user-email) login
